INSERT FIRST PART OF TRANSCRIPT HERE. AFTER FIRST SPEAKER INSERT THIS:\nTRANSCRIPT SPONSOR: \n :\nThomas J. Szkutak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Tim. This was another successful year for Amazon.com. We significantly expanded our live proposition for customers and we are grateful to our customers, our global teams and our partners for helping deliver these results. Let me start by reviewing 2005 in full. Trailing twelve months free cash flow grew 11% to a record $529 million. Trailing twelve months free cash flow includes a one-time payment of $40 million in connection with a patent lawsuit settlement in Q3 of \u201905. Excluding this settlement, 2005 free cash flow grew 19% to $569 million. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. As a reminder, the financial measures we are working to maximize over the long-term is free cash flow per share. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding with 438 million shares compared with 434 million shares of 1%. Stock-based awards outstanding were 22 million or 5.2% of shares outstanding, down from 25 or 6% of shares outstanding. Return on invested capital was 34%; ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liability. Revenue grew 23% to $8.49 billion or 24% excluding the $73 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. US market grew 22% to 4.7 billion and International grew 23% to 3.8 billion 25% year-over-year growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Gross profit grew 27% to 2.04 billion and gross margin increased 87 basis points to 24%. Consolidated segment operating income grew 16% to $566 million or 17% excluding $8 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange. And operating margins decreased 41 basis points to 6.7%. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $221 million to $2.0 billion. In Q1 of \u201905 we repurchased \u20ac200 millions of our convertible debt. And as separately announced today, we will be redeeming \u20ac250 million, or approximately $300 million at recent euro/dollar exchange rates, a principal amount of our \u20ac6.78 (ph) denominated convertible debt notes to 2000 incentive parts was accrued in unpaid interest. This redemption mitigates potential solution of over 2.9 million shares and reduces our annual cash interest expense by approximately $21 million. Inventory increased 18% or $556 million and inventory turns decreased from 16 to 14 as we bolstered inventory levels for customers by optimizing in stock levels across product categories and expanding the process of product category selection in our performance centers. We will continue to increase our direct buying efforts in existing and new product categories enabling us to extend even lower prices to customers. Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased to $101 million from a year ago to $348 million, of which $87 million is capitalized software development cost. Our 2005 capital expenditures were $204 million, of which $79 million were software development cost. Now I\u2019ll discuss the fourth quarter. Revenue grew 17% to $2.98 billion or 22% excluding $121 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Worldwide unit growth for the quarter was also at 22%. Third party units representing marketplace and merchandise units sold on Amazon sites were 28% of total units, up from 26%. For the first time North America Media surpassed $1 billion and North America Electronics and General Merchandise exceeded $500 million. The Worldwide Electronics and other General Merchandise increased 31% to $901 million or 36% excluding of that, representing 30% of worldwide sales, up from 27%. Active customer accounts, representing customers who ordered in the past year, surpassed 55 million, up 19%. Gross profit grew 23% to $667 million, and gross margin increased 98 basis points to 22.4% primarily due to increased third-party sales, changes in the geographic mix of business, and $19 million increase in other revenue primarily Amazon enterprise solutions formerly known as merchant.com, partially offset by greater shipping loss driven by free shipping in Amazon Prime, our lower product prices and continued mix shift of EGM. In Q4, we offered free short-term membership trails for Amazon clients and although they are expensive we expect to continue offering of these trails to our customer base in the future. Now, I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense under FAS 123R, which we adopted early in Q1 of \u201805. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $482 million or 16.2% of sales, up 175 basis points. Fulfillment was $246 million or 8.3% of sales, up 26 basis points. In 2005, we expanded our fulfillment capacity through efficiency gains as well as increases in leased warehouse space in order to accommodate greater selection and meet anticipated shipment volumes from ourselves as well as third parties for whom we provide the fulfillment. In 2006, we expect to increase our performance base less than in 2005 to expand our capacity to touch that peak demand. For example, we intend to expand our warehouse space in Germany. Marketing was $67 million or 2.2% of sales, roughly flat as a percentage of sales year-over-year. Technology and content was $123 million or 4.1% of sales, up 127 basis points as we continue to hire computer scientists and software engineers to further innovate for customers in areas such as our Seller Platforms, Search, Web Services and Digital. Q4 \u201905 represents an annual run-rate of approximately $500 million as we enter 2006. In 2006, we will continue investing in our long-term opportunities, innovating on behalf of customers. We expect technology and content cost to continue to grow in absolute dollars, and our 2006 year-over-year percentage growth rate to be lower in 2005. G&A was $46 million or 1.5% of sales, up 27 basis points. G&A cost increased primarily due to payroll and related expenses, professional fees and legal cost. Now I\u2019ll talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods we don\u2019t allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expenses to our segments. In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $1.7 billion. Media grew 16% to $1 billion, and EGM grew 29% to $580 million representing 34% of North America revenues, up from 32%. Apparels, Jewelry and Sporting Goods revenue all more than doubled year-over-year. Other revenue was up 25% primarily from Amazon enterprise solutions. Gross profit grew 18% to $418 million, and gross margin decreased 64 basis points to 24.8% largely due to Amazon Prime and free shipping products and service mix and our price reductions across product categories partially offset by third party sales. North America segment operating income increased $30 million to $92 million or 5.5% operating margin. In the International segment revenue grew 13% to $1.3 billion. Revenue growth was 23% adjusting for the $122 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange during the quarter. Media revenue grew 6% to 968 million, or 16% excluding the foreign exchange rates. EGM grew 36% to $321 million or 49% excluding FX representing 25% of international revenues up from 21%. Gross profit grew 31% to $249 million of gross margin increase of 273 basis points to 19.3% primarily from an increase of third party sales and from vendor management including discounts from suppliers, partially offset by increased free shipping, product price reductions and product mix shift. International segment operating income increased $37 million to $93 million, and operating margin increased 233 basis points to 7.1%. This important to our numbers that are significant majority by technology and content costs are incurred in US with most of them allocated to the North America segment. The combination of operating income and our North America and international segment is a consolidated segment operating income or CSOI. Our segment information financial statement in our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income. CSOI grew 4% to $185 million or 11% excluding this $12 million unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rate. Unlike CSOI our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased 1% to $165 million; excluding the $12 million impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates operating income increased 9% to a $176 million. Our positions for income taxes includes a tax benefit of $90 million in Q4 of \u201905 or $0.21 per diluted share related to our determination at certain of our deferred tax assets are realizable. Without the benefit of this change, our effective tax rate was 43% in 2005, higher than the 35% statutory rate. Resulting from the transfer of certain operating assets from the US to international locations in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg. We will transfer additional assets in 2006 to finalize the European headquarters transition, and we will expect this will result in an effective tax rate significantly higher than the statutory rate for 2006. But we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these active transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash pay basis not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. GAAP net income was $199 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared with $347 million or $0.82 per diluted share. Excluding the $90 million tax benefit in 2005, and the $244 million tax benefit in 2004 GAAP net income would have been $110 million or $0.26 per diluted share in Q4 of \u201905 and $102 million or $0.24 per diluted share in Q4 of \u201904. Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs of customer experience: convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress include Amazon Prime. We continue to be pleased with the Amazon Prime results, subscriptions to Amazon Prime more than doubled from November to December. We\u2019ve seen increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories, with especially heavy purchases in electronics, kitchen, and health and personal care. For $79 a year, Amazon Prime members get all-you-can-eat free 2-day shipping. Our Search Inside the Book technology is now available in six geographies, most recently in Japan, where customers can preview the tax inside over a 160,000 books. Building on our successful Search Inside the Book technology, the digital team also announced it is currently developing two innovative programs: Amazon Pages, and Amazon Upgrade, to benefit readers, authors and publishers, it will enable customers to purchase online access to any page, section or chapter of a book as well as the book in its entirety. Our German site amazon.de, launched it press delivery in Q4 giving customers the ability order eligible products by 7:30 PM for guaranteed delivery by noon the next day. Worldwide active seller accounts, merchants with an order from the customer during the preceding 12 months exceeded 1.05 million, up 24% year-over-year. Amazon\u2019s China site joyo.com, in a long-term test lowered the older site threshold for customers to qualify for free shipping from RMB99 to RMB200, and offers more than 300,000 books music, video and DVD titles, making it the largest Chinese book store in the world. Amazon\u2019s Japan site, amazon.co.jp launched its sport store with over 100,000 items and more than 600 brands across 17 categories, including baseball, golf and soccer. Some price highlights include the average customer discounts across book, music and video products purchased on www.amazon.com increased over 175 basis points year-over-year. The average customer discount for electronics products on www.amazon.com increased over 50 basis points year-over-year. Customers saved over $475 million on shipping through our worldwide free shipping offers in Amazon Prime in 2005. I will conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in the Euro, Pound, Yen, Canadian Dollar and Yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt-to-market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have Euro exposure related to our interest expense on this Euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with inter-company balances denominated in foreign currencies, which is settled among subsidiaries. Depending on the amount and timing and unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows in a particular period. Our effective tax rate in 2006 is subject to significant variation based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently non-deductible for US tax purposes, such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees, the tax characterization of income earned and changes in current tax laws and estimates, including variability and predicting our taxable income in the taxable jurisdictions to which you relate. Our guidance assumes that we don\u2019t record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or restructuring-related estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For our Q1, we expect net sales of between $2.14 billion and $2.29 billion, or growth of between 13% and 20%. This guidance anticipates more than 75 million or over 400 basis points of negative impacts from foreign exchange due to the dollar\u2019s continued strength. GAAP operating income to be between 70 million and 105 million, or between a negative 35% and negative 3% decline. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $30 million. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes the negative impact of foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $135 million or between a negative 22% decline and 5% growth. For calendar year 2006, we expect net sales of between $9.85 billion and $10.45 billion, a growth of between 16% and 23%. This guidance anticipates approximately $100 million or over a 100 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $370 million and $510 million or between a 14% decline and an 18% growth. This includes approximately $135 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes the negative impact of foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $505 million and $645 million or 11% decline and 14% growth. Operating leverage should accelerate in second half of the year compared with the first half of the year. We expect our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to the operating profit growth rate year-over-year. This excludes the impact of FAS 123R, which may result in upto $100 million of tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be classified as positive financing cash flows instead of operating cash flows up from $7 million in 2005. And we expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development cost to be approximately $225 million. Our strategy is to remain relevantly focused on customer experience with our financial focus on long-term growth of free cash flow per share. We believe the investments we have made and will make in 2006 in the form of lower prices and free shipping as well as investments in further technology innovation of the right investments for future free cash flow. In the last 4 years, we\u2019ve generated nearly $1.5 billion in free cash flow while investing $1.1 billion in technology and content, and customer saved over $1.25 billion on shipping since we\u2019ve made free shipping a permanent offer and introduced Amazon Prime for customers, on top of our prices which continue to lower. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share on investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that we\u2019ll continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will further expand. Thanks and with that Tim let\u2019s move to questions.\nTim Stone, Vice President, Investor Relations: Great thanks Tom. Let\u2019s move on to the Q&A portion of the call, Jeff and Tom. Operator will you please remind once more of the Q&A process?\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Stone. If you would ask a question please do so by pressing the \u201c*\ufffd? key followed by the digit \u201c1\ufffd? on your touchtone telephone. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. We\u2019ll proceed in the order that you signal us and we\u2019ll take as many questions as time permits. Once again it is \u201c*\ufffd? \u201c1\ufffd? on your touchtone telephone to signal for questions. And we\u2019ll take our first question today from Anthony Noto with Goldman Sachs.\nQ - Anthony Noto: Jeff, in the past, you and I\u2019ve talked about \u2013 similar just I\u2019ve asked you questions about the structural challenges outside the books, music and video that I thought were apparent. As we\u2019re focused in the books, music and video business, just excluding then a business that is really advanced that is from competitive advantages and keeping a little cost operator being able to give consumers lower prices than being loyal to better selection. As you think about that business in the next 5 to 10 years, and the impact this may have on the profitability, do you worry about the profitability that business is eroding giving the digital margins are much lower than the physical margins? And then secondly, 2006 was like it\u2019s going be the third year in which your incremental margins have trended below the prior year, which means you continue to invest. At what point does that investment end and we start to a rise in your incremental margins and a return in that investment? Thank you.\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Sure thanks Anthony, and by the way I think you had twins yesterday, congratulations on that.\nQ - Anthony Noto: Thank you.\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: If you look at our digital investment, we\u2019re excited about the opportunity there going forward. In this physical world, now that\u2019s where the vast majority of media products are sold today in physical stores. And as we move forward with digital, we think Amazon is especially well-positioned to capture bigger part of that business, while media products are physical, it makes a lot of sense for a big fraction of them to be sold in physical stores, and I think that there will be a sustainable margins there after those players who can create a very good customer experience, and that\u2019s what we are working on doing. And the second part of the question, I forgot.\nQ - Anthony Noto: It was just that 2006 looks like it will be the third year in which your incremental profitability is lower than the prior year, which implies you\u2019re investing again for the future, and I just wondering at what point do we see that investment go off and a return in the investment hit the P&L which we would measure as an improvement in incremental margins?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Well if you look at 2005, it was definitely a year where we increased our cost structure significantly. We did that deliberately and we did it because we see a lot of opportunity going forward. I do think that we will see over the next couple of years that we will be able to - we\u2019ll start to see the utilization of that cost structure over the next couple of years.\nQ - Anthony Noto: Thank you.\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Thanks Anthony.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Peck, Bear Stearns.\nQ - Robert Peck: For following on Anthony\u2019s question there, could you maybe quantify or shape for us with the investments you\u2019re making, what portions are going to newer initiatives A9, Alexa, what portion is going for Amazon Prime, because Amazon Prime - could you maybe quantify how many current sub you have for Amazon Prime?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the investments we\u2019re making, we\u2019re making a number of investments that are short-term, intermediate and longer term. And we haven\u2019t quantified the pieces but certainly we should look at the investments we\u2019re making in A9 as being longer term, our digital web services are certainly longer-term initiatives for us. But again, we\u2019re making a number of different initiatives, Amazon Prime certainly is one that we\u2019re investing in today, it is expensive, and that being said, the earlier results that we see we like, we\u2019re seeing, the customers that are Amazon Prime members are shopping more, they\u2019re doing more cross-shopping, we saw a nice increase in subscriptions and Q4 with subscriptions doubling from November-December so, we\u2019re seeing some positive signs, its still very early but we see positive signs and we would like, so we would like what we see there.\nA - Jeffrey P. Bezos: And I would just add that Amazon Prime while very expensive, we see in at the same potential that we had with the three supersaver shipping. That was very expensive and yet it really improved the customer experience and we think to have a very good business results over the medium-term and that\u2019s exactly what we would expect to have happen with Amazon Prime.\nQ - Robert Peck: And a quick follow-up, could you maybe give us your thoughts on competition from eBay Express, Google Base and Freemont, what that can mean to your future growth?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Well we have a long standing practice of not talking about other companies but more generally, what I can tell you is that we believe and have believed for a long time that the internet is driving better and better consumer information. And as a result, we believe the companies that delivers sincerely better customer experiences, which includes competitive pricing, it includes reliable fast delivery, it includes having the right selection and the inventory and stock and available that those important customer experience and drivers will shine through in a world that has increasingly better consumer information. And I think many of the things that we see happening on the internet fit into that trend of better and better information, more empowerment for consumers, from where we sit because of the way we\u2019ve operated the business, we like that trend.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Heath Terry with Credit Suisse Asset Management.\nQ - Heath Terry: Great thanks. Can you talk to us a little bit about products, your international product strategy, and I know I\u2019ve asked this question before but as you continue to see success in areas outside of the - or in areas that you don\u2019t currently offer in other markets, what\u2019s the thought process behind expanding your product portfolio internationally to mere the one that you\u2019ve got in the US?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Sure. We, in terms of additional selection, you should expect going forward that we are going to add additional influx in the categories that we\u2019re in. You should expect that we\u2019re going to launch new category certainly overtime in international as well. When we launch new categories, I was trying to learn how to give the best possible customer experience that we can, we\u2019ve learned from that and then we expand to other geographies. And so that\u2019s how we think about it, and traditionally, you know that has happened before starting with the US, but certainly, over the past few years, we\u2019ve all, focused on that and all of the geographies we are in.\nQ - Heath Terry: So there is certain limitations in the international markets that have tapped you from entering categories there that have been successful here?\nA - Jeffrey P. Bezos: No I wouldn\u2019t say there are structural limitations there, as we build out categories we need to build supply chains, vendor relationships and so on. So there is the deliberate effort that takes time as we go through in opening those categories, we used the data from whatever market we first open in, we use that data to help prioritize which category as we do next in other geographies. But our selection goals, well first of all in terms of category expansion, our long-term vision it has got all of the geographies to be the same. So any story you see in any - in any category you see in any geography you will see in all the geographies. So that\u2019s a long-term vision. And then within each category, we also continue to add selection. So even in categories, even in US books, the category that we\u2019ve been working on the longest, even in that category over this past year, we added significant selection.\nQ - Heath Terry: Thank you.\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Thank you.\nOperator: From CIBC World Markets, Paul Keung.\nQ - Paul Keung: Hi, looking at free cash flow growth its been, you sell it some in the mid-teens and back at this year, and then based on your guidance, it looks like you are looking for free cash flow both next year and a mid point somewhere plus or minus 10%. So, based on this a question I guess very similar to that as Anthony, I mean as you claim your business out, and if you look at the range of guidance for next year, is it possible to manage a business group \u2013 may not go next year or do you actually manage actively the kind of, to the same growth comparable to your topline?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Well certainly, we have a focus on trying to make sure that we grow free cash flow and free cash flow per share overtime, certainly, its certainly a key element that we look at and certainly most important measure. That being said we are going to make sure we do the right thing for long-term investors as well and as you look at 2006 specifically, we think that free cash flow will trend largely with operating income. And as you look at the guidance you can see that based on the Q1 guidance that we\u2019ve given and the total year guidance that we\u2019ve given, that we expect that the leverage would be slightly be better in the second half versus the first half. So again, as you look at free cash flow it\u2019s, we think it will trend inline with how I described.\nQ - Paul Keung: Is that more specific to your OpEx, or is it the capital spending that\u2019s causing them?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Yes, if you look at the operating expense for 2005, and the buildup that we\u2019ve had through the course of the year, you\u2019ve seen that, very specifically, our total operating expenses are up 127 basis points, our technology and content is 115 basis points of that increase. And as Jeff described earlier, that\u2019s because of the opportunities that we see. We are going to still increase technology and content next year, we are going to hire more software development engineers and computer scientists, but I would not expect that the increased technology and content in 2006 to be as great as 2005. So again, you have the base that we have that as you see as in Q4, and then the elements that I described, which would mean that, as you get closer to the back half of the year, will be lapping some of the big increases that you saw in 2005.\nQ - Paul Keung: Got it, I see and a real quick one. I\u2019ve seen some interesting things you\u2019ve done in Alexa, IMDb and on the Search, I was curious, is there any monetization of those assets in your \u201806 forecast?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Sure, yeah, the, certainly the IMDb will certainly be monetized, that today, it\u2019s an interesting business for us and, certainly to cooperate into the guidance for 2006.\nQ - Paul Keung: Yeah, thanks.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll hear from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.\nQ - Jeetil Patel: Hi guys two questions, first of all can you talk about just overall market wise, that UK ecommerce market is there any interesting new onsets challenges, changes in the market dynamic there from economy standpoints, maybe a slowdown, as you went throughout the quarter? Second, can you talk about, I guess the third party business in Europe and is that, are you getting enough selection in broadly in the international markets to drive relevant and drive transactions, or do you think there is still opportunity to build out selection to a third party platform there?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the, we\u2019ve launched and in the practice of not talking about individual countries but if you look at certainly your international growth, we saw, we had very solid performance in our international segment in Q4. We grew revenue 13% on a dollar basis but 23% on a local currency basis, which was consistent with what we saw in Q1, a little bit below what we saw in Q3, - Q2 and Q3 with Q3 had Harry Potter fixed in it, where our operating performance in total was very strong with gross margins being at the highest level its been in sometime, gross profit being up 44%, and CSOI growing 89%, so strong overall operating performance in international. And then in terms of the third party it continues to be a big part of our overall mix globally in both segments. As I\u2019ve mentioned in the opening comments the third party mix is 28% of our total units globally, that\u2019s up from 26% in 2000, Q4 2004 and we still see a lot of opportunities to add selection as the seller as well as third party selection.\nA - Jeffrey P. Bezos: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll hear from Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray.\nQ - Safa Rashtchy: Good afternoon, could you talk about the investments that you are making in the digital area, what is needed to get that operation going assuming in the next few years you will have a sizable part of your media available in digital format, in addition to obviously securing those titles from the content providers, and having some basic technology which I assume is already available? What else do you need to do to get there, and can you give us some color on these investments you\u2019re making? Thanks.\nA - Jeffrey P. Bezos: It\u2019s a good question that\u2019s premature for me to talk in any detail about those initiatives, we will, you just have to stay tuned on what we are doing there.\nQ - Safa Rashtchy: Okay, then if I could do a follow-up on a different topic, and Tom could you talk about your expectations on return on equity, do you expect it to continue to increase or given the investment mode that you are in, and a decrease in operating income on \u201906, what should we expect on ROE?\nA - Thomas Szkutak: Sure, we hadn\u2019t, we are not giving guidance on ROE specifically, but certainly, our return on invested capital if you will was 32% for the year, and again, we still think it\u2019s something that we utilize capital very efficiently, and we think that there is a lot of opportunity overtime to improve that.\nQ - Safa Rashtchy: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jim Friedland, SG Cowen.\nQ - Jim Friedland: Thanks. Can you give an update on a regulatory front, if there is any visibility when you might need to collect sales tax beyond the states where you have physical operations?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: No this is not a lifetime new there, we collect sales tax in a few states today, and we continue to work, try to help legislators come up with something that\u2019s simple.\nQ - Jim Friedland: And in the states where you do collect sales taxes is there any kind of meaningful difference in the dynamic between the way your customers purchase versus others states like maybe not buying as many big ticket items, things like that?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: No, in fact it\u2019s not just the individual states that you sell to, you need to be aware that we collect value-added tax and the countries that require it, and have been doing so for since inception, so again we have a lot of other data points, on the states that we collecting.\nQ - Jim Friedland: Okay great thanks.\nOperator: Moving on to Imran Khan with JP Morgan.\nQ - Imran Khan: Yes, hi Jeff and Tom, in terms of, you are investing lot of money in increasing customers\u2019 experience, if I look at that revenue growth rate, your US and International business growing at the same rate. So two questions, in terms of international, what can you do to accelerate the growth rate because I am assuming the market set is probably bigger than US. And secondly, if you look at the US numbers, I know you don\u2019t report gross margin that\u2019s volume but how do you think about the market share because if I look at the ecommerce market that\u2019s probably growing like 24-25%, you are reporting 21% revenue growth. So do you think you are losing market share, or the growth is coming from other categories and if so if you see an opportunity to expand into those categories? Thank you.\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Sure, I\u2019ll take the North America piece first, I think we\u2019ve made, good progress we\u2019ve looked at our share on a product category \u2013 by product category basis. We think we are doing pretty well there, if you look at the results that we\u2019ve had, our North America revenue grew 22% in 2005. That\u2019s actually an acceleration up from 400 basis points, up 400 basis points from 2004. If you just look at the history, 2005 with 22% growth, 2004 was 18%, 2003 18%, 2002 12%, and 2001 3%. So again, you see some nice progress of the past five years in terms of growth and so, the challenge going forward is how can we continue to accelerate that growth. In terms of international, we still think there is a lot of opportunity as you mentioned, we are going to as I mentioned earlier, its going to continue to expand selection in the categories we are in. We are going to expand into new categories overtime, certainly overtime we should expect that\u2019s also launched new countries, certainly we are going to invest more in pricing as well and continue to focus our resources on improving the customer experience. So those are things that we think we can do to improve our growth there, and will certainly get a lot of our attention.\nQ - Imran Khan: Okay thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from Mark Rowen with Prudential.\nQ - Mark Rowen: If I could, two questions actually, the first if I could just follow-up on Imran\u2019s question. So when you look at the international growth in media products and also consumer electronics, they tend to be trending about the same now as North America. And would you say that, as you go country-by-country, in Germany and the UK and Japan and France? Are you at similar levels of penetration in those product categories as you are in the US and North America? And is that why the growth is sort of trending at the same level or is that something specific going on internationally that\u2019s causing the growth to decelerate towards that trend line and then I have another question if I could?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Sure, I think if you look at the categories that we are in outside of the US, we are actually in each of the countries in less categories outside of the US than inside of the US, so its certainly an opportunity for us to grow, and again I think if you look at the deceleration that you just described, in Q4 specifically, again if you look at our total performance, you see that the performance is certainly the revenues is growing 23% excluding exchange which is, higher than our North America growth, but on top of that our gross profit is up 44%, our gross margins are up 273 basis points. Our CSOI excluding exchange is up 89%. So again, we have a strong overall performance, what we need to make sure going forward is that we, we have good balance between growth and profitability and driving free cash flow off our international. So that\u2019s what we are thinking about it. Did you said you had another follow-up question?\nQ - Mark Rowen: Yeah just on that one also, so would you say that you are at similar levels of market share and say the media products categories in places like the UK and Germany as you are in the US?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Yeah we haven\u2019t disclosed our market segment share, results by country or anything, but I would certainly say there is, certainly very sizeable opportunities both inside the US and outside of the US and, even outside of the categories that we in, again we are in, we are just in less categories today outside the US than in the US, and so there is certainly a lot of opportunity and so globally.\nQ - Mark Rowen: Okay my other question is for Jeff, Jeff you\u2019ve said for a long time that your model more efficient than the traditional retail model, because you don\u2019t have to invest in real estate virtual, which always goes up and instead you tend to invest in technology, which goes down. But if I add up all of your expenses as a percent of revenue and adding free shipping which is sort of view as a marketing expense, I think in 2005, it was a little over 20% and in the fourth quarter little over 19% which is 200 or 300 basis points higher than a company like Wal-Mart, so could you sort of just give us an idea why that such a paradox, why is that we are not seeing more efficiency if in fact the model is more efficient?\nA - Jeffrey P. Bezos: Well, I think one thing to keep in mind is that if we were not investing in some of these new initiatives, such as digital and web services, our cost structure would be different toady. So if we were totally optimizing our cost structure for a kind of steady state business you\u2019d see a different cost structure. Other things that we talk about that you may remember are if you look at the return on investing capital, the dynamics between our business and traditional retail are very different in large part because of the efficiency of our capital model, high inventory turns, low PP&E.\nQ - Mark Rowen: Okay thanks.\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Sure.\nOperator: We will be taking our final question from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.\nQ - Justin Post: Yeah, couple of things about gross profit which actually surprise me upside versus our forecast, it looks like gross profit in Europe was really strong, was there a product mix. I think you mentioned some vendor improvement, is that sustainable? And then on the other revenue growth, has the credit card growth kind of flattened down a little bit here and can you give us any outlook an what do you think for other revenues going forward?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Sure in international, we did see a very positive vendor management, we did see a positive from third parties, we also saw from, you mention mix actually the product mix, we had EGM which is a lower margin, actually grew at faster rate, so that actually was, hurt gross margin if you will. But then also, partially offsetting the expansion that we saw was certainly lower prices to our customers. So that\u2019s kind of the picture on the international side. On the other in North America, yeah, we saw a very good growth in our merchant.com business if you will, out third party business growth and, we have two big pieces that roll through after North America, the other pieces are co-branded credit card, we did have a very large 2004 Q4, as we had mentioned before and we are lapping that so that was essentially flat, so the third party business so that\u2019s our merchant.com business was very strong.\nQ - Justin Post: Great and just a follow-up, is the improvement in Europe the same or whether there was some one-time buys that really helped you out in the fourth quarter?\nA - Thomas J. Szkutak: Yeah, as I talk about it earlier, the challenge was you described as Europe, it\u2019s actually international which includes our Asia business as well. But, the challenge with our international segment is to make sure that we have a good balance between unit growth and profitability. And so which you saw is, certainly growth in international it was stronger excluding exchange that we saw in North America. But again, we had expansions in gross margins and operating margins there. So the challenge going forward is we need to make sure that that is balanced and that we get both, strong growth and profitability of free cash flow there.\nQ - Justin Post: Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Justin. Thank you for joining us in the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least till the end of quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talk to you again in next quarter.\nJeffrey P. Bezos, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: And that does concludes today\u2019s Amazon.com fourth quarter 2005 financial results conference. We thank you all for joining us.\nTRANSCRIPT SPONSOR: \n :"}], "2007": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2006, "date": "2007-02-02 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2006 financial results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Kim Nelson. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKim Nelson: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2006 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2007, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2005 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2005. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Kim. We demonstrated significant sequential improvement in operating leverage, achieving 4% positive leverage in Q4 from negative 11% in Q3. Operating leverage is the change in consolidated segment operating income relative to the change in sales. We increased Q4 CSOI by 24% year over year, as we grew gross profit by $183 million but operating costs by only $139 million. This marks a substantial improvement in leverage versus the other three quarters of 2006, as we lapped the higher spending in technology and content and gross profit dollars grew faster than operating expenses, driven by accelerated revenue growth. In 2006, free cash flow decreased 8% to $486 million, largely reflective of our negative operating leverage during the first three quarters of the year. Sequentially, trailing 12 month free cash flow increased $119 million compared with Q3, an improvement of 33%. Worldwide revenue grew 34% to $3.99 billion or 30% excluding the $122 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in exchange rates. Worldwide unit growth was 23%, and active customer accounts exceeded 64 million, up 16%. Media revenue increased to $2.5 billion, up 25% or 21% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $1.4 billion, up 55% or 51% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 35% of worldwide sales, up from 30%. For the first time, non-media dollar growth exceeded media dollar growth, even though media grew 25% in the quarter. Worldwide gross profit increased $183 million or grew 27% to $850 million in Q4. Gross margin decreased 108 basis points to 21.3% from product and third-party mix, lowering prices for customers in Amazon Prime. Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.1 million, and third-party units representing marketplace and merchants@ units sold on Amazon sites, or 25% of total units versus 28% in the prior year. Third-party mix decreased as we transitioned to our new toys, baby and video games stores in the US which are now, like most of our stores, a combination of Amazon retail and third-party sales. Worldwide revenue growth benefited by approximately 160 basis points year over year from sales in these categories and excluding these categories, third-party units as a percentage of total units increased year over year. From an OpEx standpoint, we achieved the slowest growth rate in total segment operating expenses in over two years. G&A declined year over year, which reflects a benefit related to insurance recoveries of $8 million. Now, I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 31% to $2.21 billion, setting a six-year growth rate record. Media revenue grew 21% to $1.25 billion, fueled by double-digit growth across all categories: books, music, movies, video games and software. EGM revenue grew 51% to $876 million, representing 40% of North America revenues, up from 34%. North America gross profit grew 27% to $532 million, and gross margin decreased 76 basis points to 24.1% from product and third-party mix, lowering prices including free shipping and Amazon Prime. North America segment operating income increased 33% to $122 million, a 5.5% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 37% to $1.78 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusting for the $121 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 29% to $1.25 billion or 21% excluding FX. EGM revenue grew 63% to $523 million or 50% excluding FX. This is the first time international EGM has surpassed $0.5 billion in sales in a quarter. EGM now represents 29% of international revenues, up from 25%. International gross profit grew 28% to $318 million, or grew 19% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 135 basis points to 17.9%, which reflects lowering prices, product mix and free shipping offers, offset partially by increased third-party mix. International segment operating income increased $14 million or 15% to $106 million, a 6% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international operating income increased 6%. CSOI grew 24% to $229 million or 5.7% of net sales. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 20% to $197 million or 4.9% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $91 million in Q4, compared to a benefit of $38 million in the prior year that resulted from the determination that certain of our deferred tax assets were realizable. Our annual effective tax rate was 50%. Our effective tax rate was higher than the 35% statutory rate, primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg. We expect our effective tax rate in 2007 to be approximately 35% or less. However, there is potential for significant volatility of our effective tax rate due to several factors, including from variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. In 2006, we paid $15 million in cash taxes and in 2007, we expect cash taxes paid to be approximately $25 million as we continue to benefit from NOLs. GAAP net income was $98 million or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with $199 million and $0.47 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $19 million to $2.02 billion. In Q1 2006, we repurchased EUR250 million of convertible debt, and in Q3 2006 we repurchased 252 million of our common stock or 8 million shares. Inventory increased 55% to $877 million, and inventory turns decreased from 14 to 13, as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories. Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased $109 million from a year ago to $457 million. Our 2006 capital expenditures were $216 million, of which half were software development costs. Our return on invested capital was 29%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high-level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuations in the euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar and yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have euro exposure related to our interest expense on this euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies, which are settled among subsidiaries. Depending on the amount and timing and unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters that could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows in a particular period. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variations, based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations; the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently nondeductible for US tax purposes, such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees; the tax characterization of income earned; changes in current tax laws; and changes in estimates, including accurately predicting our taxable income in the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates. Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q1, we expect net sales of between $2.85 billion and $3 billion, or growth of between 25% and 32%. This guidance anticipates greater than 300 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $82 million and $122 million or between a 22% decline and 16% growth. This includes approximately $38 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $120 million and $160 million, or approximately flat to 33% growth. For the calendar year 2007, we expect net sales of between $13 billion and $13.7 billion, or growth of between 21% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $355 million and $505 million, or between a 9% decline and 30% growth. This includes approximately $165 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $520 million and $670 million, or between 4% growth and 34% growth. We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with some variability from changes in working capital. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250 million. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share, while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve the customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. Thanks and with that, Kim, let's move to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Could you talk a little bit about your gross margin trends embedded in your outlook for next year? Also, can you talk a little bit about this quarter? If we look at year-over-year incremental gross margins as around 18% on a year-over-year basis, why was it down versus your overall gross margin? Can you tell us what the Toys-R-Us impact was this quarter?\nTom Szkutak: Sure. As you look at our total year guidance for next year, we are not splitting out the individual pieces, giving guidance on the individual line items -- so we're not giving guidance on gross margin, for example. But the way you should think about it is we will certainly have lower prices next year, continued COGS reductions, as well as we think certainly we're going to be adding more third-party sellers. So again, I think those are some of the key dynamics as you look at our gross margins next year. Could you repeat the second part of your question, Justin? I couldn't hear that.\nJustin Post: Sure. When we look at the year-over-year incremental gross margin, it seems to be around 18%, based on the numbers you report. But some of that was probably due to Toys-R-Us. So I'm wondering if you could help us understand what the impact was on this year's or last year's gross margin from Toys-R-Us.\nTom Szkutak: Yes. In terms of the Toys-R-Us impact, I can't help you, but I can say, from a revenue perspective, we certainly had both retail and third parties as it relates to toys, baby and video games; that impacted our total revenue by approximately 160 basis points. But in terms of the margin, we are not disclosing the specific margin related to that part of the business.\nJustin Post: Thanks. Good media sales.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs.\nAnthony Noto: A comment on two things. One, your new active customers totaled 2 million in the quarter, which is a decline year over year of about 38%, and last quarter was also a decline of about 13%. So we see an acceleration there. I'm just wondering, do you think that the new active customer growth will continue to decline in 2007? Second, I know that 2006 was an investment year. But if I look at 2005 versus your outlook for 2007, it appears at the midpoint that you'll add about $4.9 billion of incremental revenue and only about $31 million of incremental operating income. I just wonder, when do you think the model will show leverage, where an incremental dollar of revenue will really drive incremental operating income and free cash flow? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. If you look at the active customers, it's actually up 16% year over year. What you're seeing is -- certainly we're seeing, with the revenue growth year over year excluding exchange rates, you're seeing a 30% growth. So we're getting more share of wallet from customers. If you could just repeat, sorry, the second part of the questions, related to the leverage? That was from 2005 to 2007?\nAnthony Noto: Yes. I'm really just trying to understand, I know that 2006 was an investment year, and I think a lot of investors, including us, were hoping for some leverage in 2007. But now it appears that your operating income margins will be down in 2007 at the midpoint versus 2006 after an investment year. So I went back to 2005 and said, what has happened over that time period? It looks like you revenue will grow almost $5 billion, but your operating income would not have increased at all over that time period.\nTom Szkutak: Right. What you're seeing is we had an increase in our cost base both in 2005 and 2006. Certainly, we spent a lot of time talking about technology and content over the past few calls. You've seen that that growth rate has slowed, and so when you look at 2007, you should expect that our growth from an annual basis will be significantly less than it was in 2006. But what certainly has happened from 2006 to 2005 is on top of that, you had gross margins coming down. The primary reason for that, there's certainly a lot of different factors, but certainly lower prices, the mix of categories that we're in; we entered a lot of new categories with new selection, and so that is driving it, as well as we were certainly helped throughout the course of the year by third-party sales. So as you think about it going forward, even though you have seen the gross margins come down, a lot of these newer categories are becoming much more meaningful for us and over time, we will be able to get those margins to be very solid within our business. Today, as you can imagine, with some of the new categories that we have, what we're trying to do is get to scale. When we get to scale on those particular categories, good things happen. Think about particularly in international, where we are very, very small within EGM just a few years ago, and now it's become a much more meaningful part of our business. When that happens, we're able to get a lot more traffic to those particular categories. When that happens, you get a lot more third-party sellers coming to sell on our detail pages. We also get better prices with suppliers as their volume grows. So again, our strategy is to grow those businesses. Even though you see the gross margin going down, and that being one contributor of it, it's something that we are very happy with, because we need to get the scale in those businesses. Over time, that will be very beneficial to shareholders.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Pitz - Banc of America.\nBrian Pitz: Thank you. A couple of questions. On operating margins, the split between US and international, can you talk about how we should think about that going forward? Are they pretty close to parity? It looks like in the current quarter they are, but just any thoughts on 2007 and beyond? And then, web services, can you comment on the revenue opportunity there and potential timing? Are you factoring in any revenue from web services for 2007 in your guidance? Any kind of update on that would be great. Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. First, on the segments, the operating margins and how you should think about them, in addition to the comments I made about many of the categories that make up EGM in terms of that scale, we're certainly further ahead in scale in our North America segment in some of those categories, particularly, say, in consumer electronics. We have been selling in that category for a longer period of time. But certainly, as you think about the two different segments, one thing that you should be aware of: our third-party penetration overall, we said, is 25%. Over the past several quarters, certainly we have had a much bigger penetration in terms of third-party units as a percentage of total in our North America segment versus our international segment. That is because we have been selling third-party units, particularly Merchants@ units in North America for a longer period of time. With the launch of Merchants@ international, more recently, that's certainly an opportunity for us to grow over time. Then if you look at again, our EGM penetration is just a much smaller rate within international. So again, there's an opportunity to improve a lot more from the third party business vis-a-vis North America. But again, I think we have opportunities, really, in both segments to improve our operating margins over time. Then the second part of your question, web services.\nJeff Bezos: The Amazon Web Services team has a number of different web services. They have the simple storage service, which allows you to store data in the Internet cloud, and then it's securely stored and you can retrieve it. It's self-service, it's very inexpensive; developers really like it. There's also EC2, which is the Elastic Compute Cloud. It does the same thing, but with compute instead of data. There's also e-commerce services, there's Mechanical Turk. So there are a number of things. There's Alexa Web Services. These services are getting a lot of adoption, and developers really love them, getting a lot of buzz in the blogsphere, being heavily used by startup companies. As far as their impact on the financials, it will take some time before they have enough scale to have a meaningful impact that becomes visible, given the scale of our other businesses. So with a $10 billion business, even though these businesses are doing very well, it's going to take some number of years before they become meaningful. But we're thrilled with the progress, and that team is just doing a bang-up job.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus.\nScott Devitt: Thank you. The domestic business, revenue growth accelerated from 21% last quarter to 31% this quarter. I understand a component that is the toys. So I was wondering if you could give us a normalized domestic growth rate. But beyond that, there was still acceleration, so if you could categorize where the growth was coming from -- new categories, the loyalty related to Prime, new customers or otherwise?\nTom Szkutak: The impact worldwide of toys, baby and videogames was approximately 160 basis points, and that translates into approximately 300 basis points for North America. So if you adjust that from the 31% you get about 28%.You are right, we did see very nice sequential growth versus third quarter, and really all of the quarters was the best growth rate overall in six years. There was a number of different reasons for that, but certainly Prime adoption was certainly one. The fact that we, as you noticed, we worked very hard during the year, in terms of making sure that we had great low prices. We expanded unique selection considerably year over year. In addition to the unique selection, we improved a lot, particularly in the second half, on our in-stock levels. So the combination of all these factors is really what helped the North America growth in Q4.\nScott Devitt: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you very much. It looks like there has been a fair number of small merchants coming over and trying third-party sales on Amazon. What are you going to get those? Is that purely inbounds, or are you also trying to go out to other marketplaces and attract third-party sellers? Any quick comments on the product results so far for Amazon Unbox, and maybe implications that could have for broader digital downloading strategies? Thank you very much.\nTom Szkutak: I think from a third-party perspective, one of the things you're seeing is when we add the amount of unique selection that we continue to add, and just some of the category expansion and the traffic to those category expansions, that's naturally attracting more third-party sellers. So that's something I talked about a little bit earlier and something that we want to continue to do.\nJeff Bezos: We do have an outreach program, and it's very effective. But most of that activity is inbound. It's people just knowing, they see other sellers on the website, and they want to get their selection into that competitive mix so the website sort of serves as its own advertisement for sellers. That's a very effective and obviously very low-cost way of attracting new sellers. But the outbound reach is also very effective.\nTom Szkutak: Then on digital, the second part of your question, there's still a bunch of things in our pipeline that we will be rolling out over time. So I encourage you to stay tuned.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray.\nSafa Rashtchy: Thank you and good afternoon. Could you give us a little bit more color on the dynamics of the gross margins, in particular? As I see it, this is the lowest gross margins you have recorded in the past five years. I understand the rationale you're giving, that you're growing the top line. But the dynamics that you mentioned like the partnerships, the third-party sales, the lower prices on Prime, have been with you, certainly throughout the past year and yet the margins have not been this low. So to what degree are you getting the growth from the lower prices? Also, what can we expect, how low can we expect the margins going forward? Tied to that, do you still have any goals of double-digit operating margins?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of gross margin, I briefly mentioned this earlier in the call. There's a number of different dynamics, and you mentioned some of them. Lower prices were certainly one of them. But I think the one that you should certainly take a look at is the mix of products. Again, I think that's something that we actually like. Our non-media dollar growth worldwide for the first time was actually higher than our media growth, from a dollar standpoint. Again, what that is telling us, as we look at it, is it's helping us get to scale in a lot of these individual categories. We still have a lot of work to do, to do that, but again, we're starting to see some meaningful changes with such high growth rates, with growth rates over 50% in EGM worldwide. So very, very strong across the board growth rates in a lot of categories. So those growth rates are going to help us. Then compounded on top of that, as we continue to grow in those categories, is really going to help us get to scale, help us to continue to get better traffic, which will help us get third parties. Certainly, the third parties will help us expand margins, as well as get better prices as our volume gets bigger with many of these suppliers. So again, that's what's going on there. That's something that we're trying to do to try to get that improving over time.\nSafa Rashtchy: Any target on the operating margin going forward?\nTom Szkutak: The operating margin certainly, as we said before, we focus on operating profit dollars. We start first with free cash flow dollars, then operating profit dollars. But certainly, we still think there's a lot of room, from an operating margin standpoint.\nJeff Bezos: We haven't changed our long-term view about what the model can be.\nTom Szkutak: Correct.\nSafa Rashtchy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns.\nRobert Peck: My question sort of ties into Brian's a little bit there. He was talking about the revenue opportunity from Amapedia, EC2, Askville, et cetera. Could you tell us a little bit about what is being invested into that, and when we may see a pare back of some of that? As part of that question, Endless.com, you are doing the negative shipping offers. Some believe that could be a testing ground for Amazon.com someday. Is negative shipping one of the options of where Amazon could go?\nJeff Bezos: Well, you are referring to our new shoe site, Endless.com. Endless.com, as a standard practice, offers free overnight shipping as well as a 110% price guarantee, 365-day returns and pre-return shipping, too. So that's the standard practice. But through February, Endless is offering negative $5 overnight shipping. It's an unusual promotion that we're doing to draw attention to Endless.com, so that we can introduce it to our customers and that's working very effectively.\nRobert Peck: Is that's something that's on the table that, should it be successful, could be ported to Amazon.com?\nJeff Bezos: You know, that's not something that we have considered. This is a special promotion just through the month of February. We're getting such great traction with our standard practices of Free Super Saver Shipping on Amazon for orders over $25, as well as we have equivalent programs around the world. Also, of course, for Amazon Prime members, you pay $79 a year for unlimited free two-day shipping. That program, as you know, has also been met with a lot of adoption. So we are very excited about those, and we haven't considered the negative shipping beyond Endless.com.\nRobert Peck: The first part of that question was the investment. Can you give us any sort of gauge of what's the investment into all of these endeavors, and when we may get to see some leverage on it?\nJeff Bezos: Well, the big investments are in digital and web services. Other things that you mentioned are very minor investments.\nRobert Peck: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities.\nJeetil Patel: Great, thank you. Two questions. As you look at your technology and content investment, about $600 million, that's what you spent in 2006, but what is intended for the growth of the existing business versus new businesses and ventures? Second question, if you look on a contribution profit basis, do you think that just broadly, the ecommerce industry unit economics mirror what you're doing or do you think you're artificially surpassing overall the unit economics of the business by using a low price strategy? I'm trying to figure out whether your view is that the industry's profitability moves to your model, or you actually have been holding it back for the past couple of years.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the first question, in terms of technology and content, we have not given a split in terms of what, if I understood the question, what is for the core part of the business and what is for future. But certainly, it's being spent on a number of different initiatives. Jeff mentioned a few of them. Certainly, we're making investments in terms of the incremental spend, which we're spending that largely on web services, digital, new categories as we launch them, seller platforms, making it easier for sellers to sell. So those are certainly key investment areas for the business. Could you maybe repeat or restate the second part of the question?\nJeetil Patel: Yes. If you look at the overall variable profitability in your business, is your thesis on your aggressive pricing strategy to end customers that overall unit economics will migrate across the ecommerce market towards your model, in terms of, call it about a couple of dollars per transaction? Or do you think that you've been holding it back as a way to grow your volume in the near term in this growth environment?\nJeff Bezos: I suspect that what we will see over time is that there will be multiple winners of different scales pursuing different strategies in that regard. So you may see that it probably doesn't end up being one size fits all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thank you. Your results suggest that Prime is really doing what you would like it to do, based on the top line growth, the lower gross margins and also the flattish shipping revenues, despite the 34% increase in sales. So this is a program that has been in place for almost two years now. Can you give us some sense of metrics around Prime, and also discuss the usage patterns during the holiday? Then can you also talk about to what degree Prime customers are more or less price-sensitive than other shoppers? Thank you.\nJeff Bezos: Sure. In terms of Prime customers, what we're seeing right now is adoption is very strong, Prime customers are certainly buying more from us, so we're getting a bigger share of wallet from those particular customers. They're also doing more cross-shopping. Beyond that, at this time, we're not disclosing other statistics or metrics around Prime. That said, though, it's something that from a business perspective, we do spend a lot of time on and continue to look at very closely. We like what we see, and so that's something that we think we certainly want to continue to grow that business and subscribers continue to grow nicely. We look forward to having more Prime customers because we think over the long term it's a great win for customers. Customers are seeing that today, and we think it will be great for shareholders over the long term as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets.\nPaul Keung: I hate to ask the question again, but it's important, I guess, when you look at Amazon Prime, is the economics of a Prime customer very different than that of the average customer on the platform? I'm trying to understand whether this in itself long-term is going to be accretive to the overall platform.\nJeff Bezos: Yes. We certainly believe that it is, and we like the trends that we see. They are very positive, and we think certainly would be very helpful over the long term.\nPaul Keung: So it's equal or better for the economics then, is probably the right way to think about it on a transactional basis?\nJeff Bezos: Again, the way we're looking at it today, we were very pleased at the start of Prime, when we launched it. We continue to see favorable trends. We have found ways to become more productive with some of the volume we're getting with Prime customers. There's things that we think we can do over the long term to make it even better from an economic standpoint. So we're continuing to try to innovate on behalf of both customers and make it better for shareholders over time. But we like what we see so far, and we need to continue to make it even better.\nPaul Keung: The toys category, how fast did that category grow year over year this quarter?\nJeff Bezos: We're not breaking out any subcategory details. But again, the impact of toys, video games and baby was 160 basis points on our total revenue year over year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Imran Khan \u2013 JP Morgan.\nImran Khan: Thank you for taking my question. I have a couple of questions. Your inventory was up 51% year over year, which is a slight deceleration from last quarter\u2019s growth rate, but still pretty strong growth. So I am trying to understand where this growth is coming from. Is it toy category or some other categories? Secondly, I was wondering if you could give us some color what kind of user impact you're seeing from the introduction of the Unbox product?\nJeff Bezos: In terms of the inventory question, we continued to add a lot of selection, a lot of unique selection during 2006. So that was certainly a driver. We also worked on improving in-stock selection over the course of 2006, which is why you are seeing the growth that you're seeing. Certainly, this is something that will have some volatility over time, but certainly you should expect that over time it will flatten off to potentially trickle upwards from a turn perspective. So that's how we're thinking about it. In terms of Unbox, we continue to add selection at Unbox. We're getting very good repeat customer performance back to our site. So we are very pleased from that perspective. The team is seeing especially strong performance amongst television episodes, as well as hard to find video. As Tom said, of all of our category offerings, it has amongst the highest repeat rates so we're very encouraged by that.\nImran Khan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Mark Rowen - Prudential.\nMark Rowen: Thanks. Tom, could you tell us how much video game consoles helped the North American media growth, given the strength in Xbox and your allocation in Wii's PS3's? Then on the gross margin, just a follow-up on that. It looks like the free shipping as a percent of revenue wasn't really any greater than it was a year ago. So my question is, was it primarily the promotional environment where you had to match competitive prices from other retailers, or was it primarily mix shift to lower margin categories that caused the gross margin erosion year over year?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of any specific product details on the consoles, we just don't break out that level of detail from a disclosure standpoint. In terms of the net shipping margin, you are right, it was flat at 3.1%. Certainly, the shift to our new toys, baby and video category impacted that. We talked about Prime impacting that as well. Offsetting that, we had some very good productivity as well, so those were the key drivers.\nMark Rowen: I'm sorry? Productivity in --?\nTom Szkutak: Within transportation.\nMark Rowen: I see. I'm not asking for the number on video games, but just directionally, did that help the growth rate to a material degree?\nTom Szkutak: I would say it this way. We are certainly not breaking that out, and within our media categories as well as our EGM categories, as you can see from the release, both from North America and from international, we had very strong growth across the board. Beyond that, there's not a lot I can share with you.\nMark Rowen: Okay, thanks.\nKim Nelson: Thanks, Mark. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2006, "date": "2006-10-24 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com third quarter 2006 financial results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Kim Nelson. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKim Nelson: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2006 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management views as of today, October 24, 2006 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our 2005 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as far well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2005. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Kim. I will begin with comments on our financial results. The trailing 12-month free cash flow declined 23% to $366 million, driven primarily by our increased expenditure in technology and content. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 435 million shares compared with 438 million, down 1%. During the quarter we repurchased 8 million shares or $252 million under our previously announced authorization to repurchase up to $500 million of the Company's common stock. Return on invested capital is 23%. ROIC is free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. Revenue grew 24% to $2.3 billion or 23%, excluding the $20 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. In Q3 2005, worldwide revenue benefited by 260 basis points of year-over-year growth from Harry Potter 6, plus preorder attachments. Excluding Harry Potter 6 plus preorder attachments and changes in FX, revenue growth was 26%. Worldwide unit growth was 22% or 24%, excluding HP 6 plus attachments. Active customer accounts surpassed 61 million, up 17%. Electronics and other general merchandise, or EGM, increased to $699 million, up 43%, or 41% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM represents 30% of worldwide sales up from 26%. Gross profit grew 18% to $549 million in Q3. Gross margins decreased 113 basis points to 23.8%, which reflects lower product prices for customers, greater shipping loss driven by free shipping in Amazon Prime, and product mix. Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $477 million or 20.7% of sales, up 227 basis points. Fulfillment was $209 million or 9.1% of sales, up 11 basis points. We opened a new fulfillment center in Leipzig, Germany which is now fully operational. Marketing was $63 million, or 2.7 percent of sales, up 45 basis points. Technology and content was $156 million, up 45% year-over-year or 6.8% of sales, up 98 basis points year-over-year and down 31 basis points as a percentage of sales from Q2. We are investing in technology to innovate in areas such as seller platforms, web services and digital. Additionally, we continue to invest in increasing selection. In the last 12 months we have increased selection of unique products carried in our warehouses by over 50%. In addition to adding to our category leadership and buying teams for existing categories, we have added additional resources in new categories. You should expect we will continue to add selection over time. We expect the year-over-year percentage growth in technology and content to continue to decrease in Q4 2006. G&A was $49 million or 2.1% of sales, up 72 basis points. As a reminder, in Q3 '05, we recorded a $12 million expense reduction related to actual and expected reimbursement by an insurer of certain legal costs that had been previously incurred by us. Now we will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expense to our segments. In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $1.26 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $785 million even though the comparison quarter last year included the release of Harry Potter 6. EGM grew 35% to $409 million, representing 33% of North America revenues up from 29%. Gross profit grew 17% to $343 million and gross margin decreased 78 basis points to 27.3%, primarily from lowering prices including free shipping at Amazon Prime as well as product mix. The North America segment operating income decreased 67% to $22 million, a 1.7% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 29% to $1.05 billion. Revenue growth was 26%, adjusting for the $18 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 20% to $757 million or 19% excluding FX. EGM revenue grew 55% to $290 million or 51%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. EGM represents 28% of international revenues, up from 23%. Gross profit grew 21% to $206 million or grew 18% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 19.6%, which reflects price decreases and product mix. International segment operating income decreased $4 million or 8% to $50 million, a 4.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impacts of foreign exchange, international operating income decreased 9%. The combination of operating income in our North American and International segments is our consolidated segment operating income or CSOI. Our segment information in our press release reconciled CSOI to GAAP operating income. CSOI declined 40% to $72 million. The decline in operating income was mainly due to technology and content investments. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 28% to $40 million. Third quarter 2005 operating income included a negative impact of $40 million, related to a patent litigation settlement. Our provision for income taxes was $19 million in Q3 and our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate is 51%. Our effective tax rate remains higher than the 35% statutory rate, primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU Headquarters in Luxembourg. We expect these assets transfers to beneficially impact our effective tax rate over time. Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. GAAP net income was $19 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared with $30 million and $0.07 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities decreased $199 million to $1.2 billion. As a reminder, we repurchased $252 million of our common stock in the third quarter. Inventory increased 61% to $736 million and turns decreased 11% to 13.2 as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels across product categories. Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased to $449 million. Our capital expenditures were $62 million for Q3, of which $28 million were software development costs. Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs of customer experience, convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress include Amazon Prime. In Q3 '06 we continued to see strong quarter-to-quarter sequential growth for new Prime memberships. We continue to see increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories, with especially heavy purchases in electronics, kitchen, and health and personal care. We launched Amazon Unbox, a digital video download service offering customers thousands of television shows, movies, and other video content from more then 30 studio and network partners from Hollywood and around the world; and we're pleased to introduce even more selection with our recent addition of Showtime Premium programming. Amazon Business Solutions launched, in beta, Web Store by Amazon and Fulfillment by Amazon, giving small and medium-sized businesses access to Amazon's order fulfillment, customer service, and customer shipping offers and underlying website technology. Our Japanese website launched its health and beauty store, offering customers a selection of over 35,000 items in 12 categories including supplements, drinking water and soft drinks, condiments, processed foods and health foods as well as cosmetics and products for bath care, nursing care and relaxation. Our Automotive Parts and Accessories store now has over 1million automotive products offered by Amazon in leading mass market and specialty retailers. In Q3 we saw a wide range of auto part purchases from air filters, shock absorbers, and handheld diagnostics scanners to a recon engine Ford 302 5 liter Xtreme OHV Remanufactured long block engine that we delivered to a customer in Spokane, Washington. Amazon's innovative Part Finder allows owners of approximately 10,000 different cars and truck models to find the correct replacement parts, performance parts, or accessories for their vehicle. Amazon Web services launched in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon EC2, in limited public beta. Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity, making web scale computing easier for developers. Just as Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon S3, enables Storage in the Cloud, Amazon EC2 enables Compute in the Cloud. Developers continue to adopt Amazon's web services. Over 200,000 have registered to date up greater than 60% year-over-year. Third-party sales remains a key part of our selection expansion. Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately 1.1 million and third-party units representing marketplace and merchants units sold on Amazon sites were 30% of total units, flat with the prior year. Additionally, our international third-party business expanded with the launch of Merchants@ in the UK and Germany. Some pricing highlights include the average customer discount for music purchased on www.amazon.com increased more than 350 basis points year-over-year. The average customer discount for DVDs purchased on www.amazon.com increased more than 200 basis points year-over-year. Over the past 12 months, customers have saved over $0.5 billion on shipping through our worldwide free shipping offers in Amazon Prime. I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance of the order trends we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there's a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in the euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar and yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand; and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have euro exposure related to our interest expense on this euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intra-company balances denominated in foreign currencies which are settled among subsidiaries. Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business results of operations, financial position, or cash flows in a particular period. Our effective tax rate is subject to a significant variation based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently non-deductible for U.S tax purposes such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees; the tax characterization of income earned; changes in current tax laws; and changes in estimates including accurately predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates. Our guidance assumes that we won't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q4, we expect net sales of between $3.625 billion and $3.95 billion, a growth of between 22% and 33%. This guidance anticipates approximately 225 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $145 million and to $235 million or between a 12% decline and 43% growth. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $35 million. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $180 million and $270 million or between a 3% decline and 46% growth. For the calendar year 2006, we expect net sales of between $10.35 billion and $10.675 billion, a growth of between 22% and 26%. This guidance anticipates a small negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $339 million and $429 million or between a 22% decline and a 1% decline. This includes approximately $113 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $452 million and $542 million, or a 20% decline and 4% decline. As you can see from our guidance, we expect operating leverage will show significant sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. We anticipate our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year-over-year with some variability from changes in working capital. This excludes the impact of FAS 123R, which could be up to $100 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation being classified as positive financing cash flows instead of operating cash flows, up from $7 million in 2005. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $225 million We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. Thanks, and with that, Kim, let's move to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: Two questions. You historically have talked about overall profit margins and cash flow margin percentages not important or indicative of the business strategy. Can you just give us a sense of how we should think about the operating profile or your game plan in areas like web services, business solutions and social networking services? I have a quick follow-up.\nTom Szkutak: Certainly when you think of web services and some of the other areas that you mentioned, it's very early. So it's certainly something we are very optimistic about over the long term. In terms of projecting anything near term, I don't think it is appropriate to do so.\nJeetil Patel: Do you look at those businesses that are in this nascent mode today as ways to fuel the growth of the core franchise? Or is it leveraging the existing infrastructure and assets that you have built out over the past nine years and putting them to use in the marketplace? How do you look at new business versus driving the existing operation?\nTom Szkutak: It is some of both. We certainly think that this can be a meaningful business over the long term and can have an impact on the overall economics of the company. The reason we're doing the web services that we are doing is because they are things that we've gotten good at over the last 11 years in terms of building out this web scale application called Amazon.com. So as we go about exposing the guts of Amazon, there are other developers out there who require those same sorts of web scale services. So these are assets and skills that we needed to build for ourselves anyway. What we're doing here is exposing those and, over time, build that into a meaningful business.\nJeetil Patel: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Anthony Noto \u2013 Goldman Sachs.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you very much. Tom and Jeff, in the past, when we have talked about the fact that we thought your cost of gross was increasing, you have pointed to the fact that you have been spending on elements in the P&L that don't necessarily drive revenue in the near term; technology and content. But as we look over the past three quarters, your marketing expense line has accelerated from 25% year-over-year growth in Q1 to 30% year-over-year growth in Q2 to 50% year-over-year growth in Q3. In your release you disclosed the fact that your marketing expense will be variable with revenue and increase or decrease depending on the competitive environment and other factors. So as your tech and development expense year-over-year started to decline, this other line item, which is tied directly to revenue, is starting to accelerate. So I was wondering if you could give us a little perspective on what is actually driving that increase in your cost of revenue? What do you think about the prospects for that as you go into 2007 and your ability to get back to double-digit incremental operating margins? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. If you take a look at our marketing expense, it has been in the range of approximately 2.2% to 2.7% over the last several quarters, 2.7% being the most recent quarter. If you look at what we've done over really the past year, we have added a lot of new selections. In fact, if you look at the unique selection that we have added under our own roof, that is up over 50% year-over-year. So what we're really doing is we've spent a lot of time adding selections; we have spent a lot of effort also making sure that our prices are low. So we're trying to make sure that our customers realize that we have great selection and good prices in the form of advertising. So that is what we're doing. It is still, I think, at a very modest spend level, being less than 3% of revenue.\nAnthony Noto: I guess it just really begs the question, is it just sort of a transition from the first year investment in technology to be able to sell the products on your site and offer them, and now you have to invest in the marketing to be able to get awareness of those products so people will buy them? When does that transition stop and we can get back to that profitability and return on your investments since your cash flow is still declining?\nTom Szkutak: Anthony, that is not the way we are thinking about it. You should think that of it in, at least in the recent history, it's been in a lower relative range. And again, we've talked quite a bit in the past about trying to make sure that we educate customers. That is what we're doing in this case. I wouldn't think of it as a fundamental shift in any way.\nAnthony Noto: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns.\nRobert Peck: Hi guys, just a couple of quick questions here. First of all, touching on Jeetil's question there in a different way, when we think about products such as Askville and EC2 and S3 and all that, can you maybe breakdown for us what is the incremental spend going to those type of more technological or even social products versus the core development of the platform? That is number one. Number two is, could you talk to us about any integration issues or hurdles you have had building the toy store up? If there are any impacts for Q4? Then could you give us more details around Unbox? Any sort of statistics you have as far as downloads, streams; anything else to give a gauge on how Unbox is doing versus the other competitors out there? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the question on specifics on spend, we haven't broken out technology and content in terms of the specific details. But what we've tried to do is give you some help by talking about some of the larger buckets. So if you look at the year-over-year increase, certainly you're seeing investments in web services, investments in digital, investments in the seller platform, investments in other customer experience. That is from a technology standpoint. In addition to that, certainly new categories. The content piece of technology and content and some of the announcements that we have made recently in terms of Automotive and other category launches are certainly part of that spend as well. In terms of your second part of the question on toys, we have certainly been spending a lot of time trying to improve selection in toys, certainly in a very short period of time both with retail selection as well as third-party selection. So we have been spending time certainly over the past several months doing that, making sure that we monitor prices carefully. So those two things we have certainly have been doing over the last several months, getting ready for the most seasonal aspect of toys, which is Q4. We have over 125,000 unique items in toys currently that we are offering. So those are things that we think over the long term toys is something that is going to be very good for customers and for shareholders. We are pleased with what we're doing there. In terms of the last part on Unbox, in terms of any statistics it is just very early. We are certainly pleased that we continue to add selection in Unbox but again, video is very early. We're going to continue to innovative on that over time and make the experience even better for customers.\nRobert Peck: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets.\nPaul Keung: Hi, Tom. The first question is on life after Toys 'R' Us, I guess. Looking at the category, looking at where you are today versus where you would have been six months or a year ago, do you think the category will be better, the same or worse in terms of revenue growth and profitability this quarter in light of what you're going to do? The second question has to do with your third-party business in Europe. I am just wanting to get an update in terms of how the Marks & Spencer launch went this month. Should we start to see an acceleration in the number of new customers on that platform now that you have the big one up and running?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of Toys 'R' Us, in terms of the revenue and the profitability, it is incorporated into our guidance in Q4. We are not breaking out the specific number within guidance. I apologize, I couldn't hear the second part of your question. Could you repeat the last part of your question?\nPaul Keung: Yes, the second part of the question had to do with the third-party business in Europe. I guess with the launch of the Marks & Spencer relationship in the UK this month, I was wondering if we should start to see an acceleration and adding new partners on that third-party platform in Europe now that the bigger one is up and running?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the third-party platform in International we're actually pleased with it. In the comments I made earlier, we have launched merchants at International for the UK and Germany. So certainly over time you will be seeing more and more partners selling our platforms so we're actually pleased with that. In terms of any specific announcements on timing, we generally don't announce specific times related to launches until they happen.\nPaul Keung: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Imran Khan \u2013 JP Morgan.\nImran Khan: Hi, thank you very much. Tom and Jeff, two questions. You talked about the inventory and stock selection increase, but if I look at the balance sheet it seems like your inventory grew 61% year-over-year, up from 36 and 33 in Q1 and Q2. I was trying to get a better sense if there is anything you're seeing into the quarter that increases your confidence to increase that inventory at that level? Secondly, actually probably a very similar question, your revenue growth guidance is guiding an acceleration. Just trying to get a better sense of what are you seeing into the quarter? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: I apologize, you're breaking up in part of your question, but in terms of the inventory increase up 61%, the two key drivers of that is expanding selection, as I mentioned earlier in one of the other questions. Year-over-year, we have increased our selection in our warehouses up 50% year-over-year. So certainly that is part of what you are seeing in inventories. We are also improving our in-stock levels. We're having more quantities on hand to better service customers. So those are really two aspects that you are seeing. Just as another note, certainly what you have seen in the past as you look at Q3 as a reminder, that we have started to bring in inventory to get ready for the holiday season. So you are seeing some of that reflected in the balance. Then in terms of investment, just also note that as you see the inventory rising, you're also seeing the payable balance rise substantially as well. Our days at the end of Q2 were 53 days. At the end of Q3 they were 63 days. Then it was also up year-over-year from 58 days to 63 days.\nImran Khan: With regards to the revenue growth acceleration guidance? I'm trying to get a sense to understand your confidence level for the Q4 guidance?\nTom Szkutak: Sure. Again, the range that we have given for Q4 is 22% to 33%. As I had mentioned, that also includes favorable exchange of approximately 225 basis points. So that is the range that we have given. We are cautiously optimistic as we enter Q4 because of the selection that we have added which relates back to the inventory question, the in-stock improvement that we are working on as well as throughout the year, the lower prices. In addition, with the Amazon Prime certainly becoming more meaningful, having Amazon Prime customers certainly taking advantage of all the selection that we have, for the first time toy customers will be able to have the advantage of that during Q4 as well as Supersaver Shipping. So all of those things we think are reflected in the guidance that we have given today.\nImran Khan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you very much. Could you talk about what kind of impact we could see on margins from the rollout of Merchants@ internationally? Or maybe a way to get at that would be, could you maybe break out what percentage of units sold internationally would be third-party versus your overall average? Secondly, just a brief comment on the operating income guidance for the fourth quarter. While you increased your revenue guidance for the fourth quarter just slightly, but you did, lower your operating income guidance. Was there something you saw that made you more concerned about margins or less confident about margins in the December quarter? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the first part of your question, in terms of Merchants@, it is difficult to predict what the ultimate third-party mix will be in each of our geographies. What we have said in the past is that certainly, as you look at our overall third-party units as a percentage of total worldwide, that we are further ahead in North America than we are in International. Certainly the launch of Merchants@ International in the countries that I have mentioned will certainly help that over time from a third-party mix standpoint. So again, difficult to predict exactly where that is going to end up. Ultimately the customer will decide. But we will continue to add retail selection as well as third-party selection. Again, the Merchants@ will help us do that. In terms of the guidance on CSOI, we actually tightened the range a little bit from what we gave you 90 days ago. The CSOI guidance for the year was 430 to 560. We tightened that during this guidance period to be 452 to 542. So we increased the lower end of the range by 22. We decreased the top end of the range by 18. So the midpoint increased slightly on the year. You are right. Given the fact that we exceeded the midpoint for Q3 by a little bit, you are seeing Q4 come down slightly. But again, the way that I am thinking about it is, it is a slight increase on the year with strong sequential leverage in Q4, which we feel good about.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray.\nSafa Rashtchy: Thank you. First, on that last point on the leverage you mentioned in Q4, how much of it is due to the normal seasonality that you always see? How much of it is because of the lower spending that you're planning to do? Secondly, beyond Q4, could you give us some outlook or guidance as to what factors will be impacting margins going forward? In the past you have indicated that you were continuing to spend and increase spending as a percentage of sales, especially on technology, as you had a number of initiatives. Have we reached a stability level for those? How should we look at the margins going forward? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of Q4, when you look at our Q3 technology and content spend, you can see that the growth rate declines versus what we have seen recently. On a percentage of revenue it actually declined versus Q2. For Q4 you should expect the growth rate will decline further, but still growing. So that is certainly one of the key drivers from a leveraged standpoint. The other one, certainly as you mentioned, I wouldn't view it as seasonal, but I view it as the growth rate. Certainly when you look at the range of growth that we are expecting, the growth rate is also helping us get leverage in Q4. So those are really the key drivers as it relates to Q4. And then in terms of going forward, we are not giving guidance, consistent with what we did last year. We're not giving guidance beyond Q4. You mentioned technology and content. What we have said over the last few quarters and consistent with that, we said that we will continue to grow technology and content. But with the deliberate buildup that we have had over the past years, we are going to be growing into that investment. But you should expect still that we will be growing on an absolute dollar basis. Keep in mind that when you think about technology and content, it is certainly the technology aspect of that; there is also a content aspect to that which is adding new selections and category expansion, which certainly we will be continuing to do over time.\nSafa Rashtchy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you. For the last several quarters, Tom, you have been talking about investing in seller platforms, digital web services and search. It seems like this quarter you dropped Search from that mix given the recent scale back in A9. So can you talk about why the change in strategy around A9 and Search? What has changed in the marketplace? Are there any cost savings involved there or perhaps how you're able to deploy the engineers working on Search? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. We still have a substantial investment in search. A9 was doing a few things for us; and one was product search, which we continue to invest in. We continue to learn a lot of things from our resources there. You shouldn't expect to see savings from that. We have certainly reallocated some resources to areas that we think are more beneficial to customers and shareholders over time, and that is what we're doing there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Rowen - Prudential.\nMark Rowen: Thanks. Two questions. It looks like your fulfillment cost deleveraged by about 20 basis points year-over-year and that is the first time that has happened in a while. Is that because of the new facility in Europe? Do you expect that deleveraging to continue for a few quarters until you build into the capacity? Second in the toy business, Wal-Mart just talked about how that was one of the categories they were going to be very aggressive on and rolling back prices on certain items. Do you feel you need to beat them on price? Or is your offering more about selection and you don't have to worry too much about the limited items that they are going to have at very cheap prices? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the first part of your question related to ops , certainly one piece of that is capacity. You mentioned the facility. We are operational in Leipzig, Germany, which is certainly a piece of that. Other things that are going on there, I mentioned the selection that we have been adding as well as improving in-stocks and you can see the build up in inventory. Certainly those are all factors that are also impacting our operational costs as a percentage of revenue. In terms of your specific questions, the second part of your question, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about any specific company. So I can't help you with that one.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus.\nScott Devitt: I had two questions. First, on the fulfillment center utilization, particularly in domestic you have added groceries, toys, jewelry, and third-party fulfillment services just in the past year. I'm wondering if there's going to be a need for additional capacity in terms of actual fulfillment centers over the next year? Or if you can meet the increased selection with the infrastructure you have? Then I had one follow-up.\nTom Szkutak: Yes. In terms of any type of guidance for next year, we are not providing. We will certainly look, we learn a lot as we go through our seasonal time of the year so we'll be going through that, obviously, in the next few months. As we go through that and learn from what we see, we will certainly make our plans more specifically for next year and we can update you as we go there. I'm sorry; you had a second part to your question?\nScott Devitt: Related to the lower gas prices and on the consumer-facing side of your business, have you noted any short-term increase in consumer purchasing patterns that would have been reflected in your fourth-quarter guidance? That would be the first question. Then on a longer term basis, even if energy prices were to stabilize at lower prices, what would it take to have the impact on your back-end logistics costs in terms of re-negotiations with the logistics providers? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the first part of your question, I don't think we are a great bellwether for the economy. But certainly any of the recent trends as well as the trends that we think will happen into Q4 are reflected in our guidance.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse.\nHeath Terry: You have often talked about this ultimately being a 10% operating margin business. With all of the changes in the business over the years, as well as this focus on services, is that still the case or have those expectations changed? On a shorter term basis, as you start building out the toy inventory and building your relationships with suppliers in that category, can you talk to us about what your experience has been and whether you have been able to get the kind of inventory commitments that you want, particularly on the hot toys for the season?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the first part of your question related to operating margins, the way we think about it, as a reminder, is we are actually trying to maximize free cash flow and free cash flow per share. So that is forefront what we are trying to do over the long term. So as it relates to operating margins, it is difficult to see where they will end up. Certainly, as we were talking about earlier as it relates to third-party mix, we are going to continue to add retail selection, we are going to continue to add third-party selection; and ultimately the customers are going to dictate what that mix will be, which will also certainly have an impact on our operating margins. So that is how we think about it. Where we will end up is difficult to say. But whether it is a double-digit or a high-single digit is hard to say. But certainly our goal is to maximize free cash flow and free cash flow per share. As it relates to toys, could you just repeat the second part of your question as it relates to toys?\nHeath Terry: I was just saying that as you have started to build out the supplier relationships and buying inventory for this holiday season, can you talk to us about what your experience has been, particularly with regard to being able to get the type of inventory, hot toys and such that you would actually want and pricing that you would want for the business?\nTom Szkutak: Well, we have been in the toy business for some time as a provider. We've also had, in terms of relationships, we certainly have some relationships outside of the U.S. as we have toy categories launches outside of the U.S. In terms of getting into specific details, I don't think it is appropriate on a vendor by vendor basis or anything like that. But we are certainly pleased with the selection we have. We have added a lot of selection in a very short period of time, over 125,000 unique items. Customers are going to benefit from that selection during Q4. Prime customers will have the benefit of getting product, toys shipped quickly to their home or office or families. We also offer Free Supersaver Shipping. Which again, those are things that will be very helpful to toy customers. We will continue to add selections over time in that category.\nKim Nelson: Thanks, Heath, and thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations web site at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s conference call."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2006, "date": "2006-07-25 19:40:36", "content": "TRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :\nExecutives: Jeff Bezos - Founder and CEO   Tom Szkutak - CFO   Kim Nelson - Director of IR \nAnalysts: Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities   Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs   Mark Rowen - Prudential   Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers   Justin Post - Merrill Lynch   Imran Khan \u2013 JP Morgan   Paul Beaver - Piper Jaffray   Mark Mahaney - Citigroup   Robert Peck - Bear, Stearns   Heath Terry - Credit Suisse \nOperator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com second quarter 2006 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Kim Nelson. Please go ahead. \nKim Nelson: Hello and welcome to our Q2 2006 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO; Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO and Tom will both be available for Q&A.  The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, July 25, 2006, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC -- each of which is posted on our IR website -- you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2005. Now I will turn the call over to Tom. \nTRANSCRIPT SPONSOR:  \n :\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Kim. I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow declined 23% to $375 million. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. The primary driver of the free cash flow decline was our increased expenditure in technology and content. Free cash flow was also reduced by a $40 million patent litigation settlement in third quarter 2005; $34 million from excess tax benefits for stock-based compensation now classified as financing cash flows; and investments in additional fulfillment capacity.  The termination of our contract with ToysRUs.com and related fee disputes had a negative impact on trailing 12-month free cash flow of $20 million. We're working to maximize free cash flow per share over the long term.  The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 443 million shares compared with 438 million, up 1%. Stock-based awards outstanding were 24 million or 5.8% of shares outstanding, down from 26 million or 6.3% of shares outstanding. We strive to efficiently manage share count.  Return on invested capital was 23%. ROIC is TTM-free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. Revenue grew 22% to $2.14 billion, or 23% excluding the $24 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Worldwide unit growth was 25%. Third-party units representing marketplace and merchant\u2019s units sold on Amazon sites were 29% of total units, up from 28%.  Active customer accounts representing customers who have ordered in the past year surpassed 59 million, up 18%. Electronics and other general merchandise, or EGM, increased 37% to $624 million, or 38% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM represents 29% of worldwide sales, up from 26%.  Gross profit grew 13% to $509 million in Q2 and gross margin decreased 187 basis points to 24%, primarily due to the wind-down and termination of our contract with ToysRUs.com, lower product prices for customers and greater shipping loss driven by free shipping and Amazon Prime.  Now we'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content, and G&A combined was $429 million or 20.1% of sales, up 192 basis points. Fulfillment was $182 million or 8.5% of sales, down 18 basis points. In 2006, we expect to increase our fulfillment space less than in 2005 to expand our capacity to satisfy peak demand.  Marketing was $52 million or 2.4% of sales, up 11 basis points. Technology and content was $151 million, up 63% year-over-year or 7.1% of sales, up 177 basis points.  We have invested in technology to innovate in areas such as seller platforms, web services and digital. Additionally, we continue to invest in increasing selection. In the last 12 months, we have increased selection of unique products carried in our warehouses by 48%.  In addition to adding to our category leadership and buying teams for existing categories, we have added additional resources in new categories such as our grocery store at Amazon.com and our sporting goods store in Germany. You should expect we will continue to focus on selection over time.  We're looking forward to the coming decrease in our year-over-year growth rate in technology and content spending in the second half of 2006. G&A was $44 million or 2.1% of sales, up 22 basis points. As a reminder, in 2Q05, we reported a $3 million expense reduction related to the favorable resolution of one of our previously outstanding legal matters.  Now we will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expense to our segments.  In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $1.16 billion, or 23% excluding the $20 million impact from ToysRUs.com. Media revenue grew 15% to $730 million, and EGM revenue grew 32% to $365 million, representing 32% of North America revenues, up from 29%.  Gross profit grew 11% to $309 million, and gross margin decreased 224 basis points to 26.7%. 170 basis points of the 224 basis point decline was due to the termination of our ToysRUs.com contract. Other drivers were lower prices, including free shipping and Amazon Prime, as well as product mix. These effects were partially offset by increases in unit volume and the year-over-year increase in third-party sales in our mix. North America segment operating income decreased $47 million to $25 million, a 2.1% operating margin.  In the international segment, revenue grew 24% to $982 million. Revenue growth was 27%, adjusting for the $25 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 17% to $718 million, or 20% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue grew 45% to $259 million, or 48% excluding FX. EGM represents 26% of international revenues, up from 22%.  Gross profit grew 16% to $200 million or grew 19% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 132 basis points to 20.4%. The decrease in gross margin is primarily from free shipping, price reductions and mix shift.  International segment operating income decreased $5 million to $55 million, a 5.6% operating margin. Excluding FX, international operating income decreased 4%. The decrease in international segment operating income is primarily due to lower prices, including free shipping; and increases in operating expense, particularly technology and content.  The combination of operating income in our North America and international segments is our consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI. Our segment information in our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income. CSOI declined 39% to $80 million. The decline in operating income was mainly due to technology and content investment, lower prices including free shipping and Amazon Prime, and $20 million from the contract termination.  Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 55% to $47 million. Our provision for income taxes was $32 million in Q2 or a 59% rate for the quarter, which includes a $4 million year-to-date adjustment to reflect our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate of 51%.  Our effective tax rate remains higher than the 35% statutory rate primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg. We expect these asset transfers to result in tax expense for financial reporting above the 35% statutory rate throughout 2006 and beneficially impact our effective tax rate over time.  Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis.  GAAP net income was $22 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared with $52 million and $0.12 per diluted share.  Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $94 million to $1.4 billion. Inventory increased 36% to $521 million and turns decreased 6% to 14.3 as we continue to focus on availability and selection and took advantage of buying opportunities from vendors. We will continue to focus on availability and selection and to increase our mix of direct buying in existing and new product categories, enabling us to offer even lower prices to customers.  Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased 52% from a year to $405 million. Our capital expenditures were $58 million for Q2, of which $27 million were software development costs.  Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs of customer experience, convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress includes Amazon Prime. Membership in Amazon Prime more than doubled from year end.  In Q2 '06, we also saw a strong quarter-to-quarter sequential growth for new prime memberships. We continue to see increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories, with especially heavy purchases in electronics, kitchen, and health and personal care.  We launched our new Toy and Baby Stores on www.amazon.com featuring tens of thousands of products offered by Amazon and leading mass market and specialty retailers. This is the largest selection of toy and baby products ever offered through Amazon.com and for the first time ever, toy and baby products are eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime.  We launched a grocery store on Amazon.com, with over 14,000 dry goods grocery products across more than 1,200 brands, all eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime.  Our German website launched its sporting goods store, offering customers a selection of thousands of sporting goods in over 25 categories in top brands like Adidas, Burton, Nike, Puma, Quiksilver and Salomon.  Amazon Enterprise Solutions extended its agreement with Target.com through August 2010 and launched a new Sears Canada-branded website, providing Sears Canada with the tools and services to control its brand, merchandising and online business using Amazon Enterprise Solutions technology.  Amazon S3, a simple storage service for software developers, gained momentum in its first full quarter after launch, providing businesses of all sizes, from Microsoft to SmugMug, with a web services solution for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the Web. Developers continue to adopt Amazon's web services. Over 180,000 have registered to date, up greater than 60% year-over-year.  Third-party sellers remain a key part of our selection expansion, and worldwide active seller accounts, merchants with an order from a customer during the preceding 12 months, exceeded 1.08 million, up 10% year-over-year. Some pricing highlights include the average customer discount across books, music and video products purchased on www.amazon.com increased more than 250 basis points year-over-year.  Amazon.co.jp increased its customer discount on pre-order new-release DVDs up to 25%. Over the past 12 months, customers have saved over $0.5 billion on shipping through our worldwide free shipping offers and Amazon Prime.  I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in the euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar and won exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have euro exposure related to our interest expense on this euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with inter-Company balances denominated in foreign currencies, which are settled among subsidiaries.  Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows in a particular period.  Our effective tax rate in 2006 is subject to significant variation based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently non-deductible for U.S. tax purposes, such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees, the tax characterization of income earned, changes in current tax laws and changes in estimates, including accurately predicting our taxable income in the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates.  Our guidance assumes that we won't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently.  For Q3, we expect net sales of between $2.17 billion and $2.33 billion, a growth of between 17% and 25%. GAAP operating income to be between $7 million and $42 million or between 87% decline and a 24% decline. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $38 million.  We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $45 million and $80 million or between a 63% decline and a 34% decline.  For calendar 2006, we expect net sales of between $10.15 billion and $10.65 billion, a growth of between 20% and 25%. This guidance anticipates a small negative impact from foreign exchange.  GAAP operating income to be between $310 million and $440 million or between a 28% decline and 2% growth. This includes approximately $120 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.  We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $430 million and $560 million or a 24% decline and 1% decline.  As you can see from our Q3 and total year guidance, we expect operating leverage will show significant improvement in the fourth quarter.  We expect our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year-over-year. This excludes the impact of FAS 123 R, which could be up to $100 million of excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation being classified as positive financing cash flows instead of operating cash flows, up from $7 million in 2005.  We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $225 million.  We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We're confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow, will further expand.  Thanks, and with that, Kim, let's move to questions. \nKim Nelson: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to ask a question? \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities. \nJeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities: A couple of questions. If you take the midpoint of the CSOI range from the last quarter to this quarter and adjust for the Toys 'R' Us impact of $50 million, it gets to about a $35 million swing, from $580 million to $545 million.  Can you just reconcile, is that all the toy category build out and scaling up in that category, or is there something else that is really driving that?  Second, you talked about web services, about 180,000 developers. When do you think you start to meaningfully monetize those 180,000 developers and the initiatives that they're up to, to built out their own services around the Amazon ecosystem? \nTom Szkutak: In terms of the guidance question, you are right. We increased the revenue guidance to $10.15 billion to $10.65 billion. In the bottom, we gave a range for CSOI of $430 million to $560 million which again, on the bottom end of that range is down $85 million from last time.  The reason why it is down from last time is because of the heavy investment in toys, which certainly includes the termination of the contract, as well as being more aggressive on prices in all of our categories. So that's really the delta on the bottom line.  In terms of web services, we are very excited about what we see so far. It is still very, very early for us. We think certainly from a return perspective, certainly we're looking at it over the long term, but we are extremely encouraged from what we see so far. \nJeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities: You provide the base level infrastructure in the web services area. Are you also looking at the SKUs and the product detail pages that you have on the platform as the monetization engine for these developers? Or is there another monetization engine to help them subsidize or generate revenues off of their initiatives? \nTom Szkutak: Well, for part of our web services, it is exactly as you say. But then there are web services like Amazon S3, the simple storage service, that has gotten traction that has vastly exceeded our expectations and continues to grow. So we are super-excited about that. That is a completely different model, where we monetize it by literally charging for the web service directly.  Then the developers who use those services will monetize them and do monetize them by charging subscription fees to their own on-demand applications. \nJeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs. \nAnthony Noto - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Jeff, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on Amazon's long-term vision and how you would qualify the way you think you can differentiate the brand going forward? I mean, there's a lot we read about in the papers, and obviously there's a lot of initiatives that have happened in the last quarter. I just wonder if we could revisit that as we have seen you announce, obviously, groceries. There's a lot of talk around a lot of other things as it relates to the media categories and digital strategy. On your site, there's a lot of new videos and other entertainment types of contents as opposed to pure product sales.  Tom, my question is you guys have talked about maximizing free cash flow dollars. I definitely understand the impact from Toys 'R' Us on your lower operating income for the fourth quarter. I don't necessarily see the benefit from lowering prices further, because it results in a pretty significant pickup in revenue. 25% revenue growth is an acceleration, that's really a positive. But it looks like it is coming at the cost of operating income, and therefore free cash flow relative to what you would have thought excluding Toys 'R' Us. I was wondering if you could comment on that. Thanks. \nJeff Bezos: Sure. Our strategy for our business is a three-fold with respect to finding the elements that matter to customers that are durable in time where we can build flywheels that we can continue to put energy into.  The three big flywheels are selection, price and availability. So if you look at each of those, we know that 10 years from now, customers will still care about selection. We know they will still care about availability and price. They'll want to get their products quickly. So the energy that we put into building those flywheels today will continue to pay dividends, even ten years from now.  So the price one is very straightforward. The more scale we have, the better our cost structure, both on the variable side with COGS and because we get to leverage our fixed expense as well. So there, we will have the ability to offer lower prices and that makes the Company scale increase, which again allows us to keep spinning that flywheel and further drive down costs and prices and so on.  With availability, you will see a similar flywheel. As you have a distributed node fulfillment center network, you get to put products closer to customers. That makes it possible to economically do outbound transportation for things like Amazon Prime. So the fact that we have a big multi-node network and that we have the volume to economically support a multi-node network puts us in a very unique and differentiated position to offer a membership program like Amazon Prime to economically afford to do things like Free Super Saver Shipping. So availability is another one.  Then selection has a similar thing. You see that the number of in-stock ASINs that we have under our own roof is up very dramatically year-over-year, more than 40%. Again, in order to be able to do that, you need a certain amount of volume because when you look at those low-turn ASINs in the tail, you need to have enough volume that you can afford to carry even those slow-moving ASINs and make them available to customers on a very rapid basis.  The third-party strategy also plays into that selection point, where the more customer volume we have, the more flow we have, the more active customers, the more third-party sellers want to interact with that customer flow. \nTom Szkutak: I think Jeff answered a good portion of the second part of your question, Anthony, with his answer as well, in terms of the pricing strategy. But you're absolutely right, pricing in the short term is expensive, but it has the benefits that Jeff described as he talked about the flywheel as it relates to pricing. It gives us the ability over the long term to have a bigger scale, to get better COGS reductions. It has the ability to leverage our fixed cost structure better as well.  So as you think about our guidance and the pricing piece specifically, that is exactly how we're thinking about it. In addition to that, the way you should think about it is it's existing categories plus new categories. As we launch these new categories, we want to make sure that we get the scale quickly to get some of the benefits that Jeff described. So that is what we intend on doing and that is the rationale. \nAnthony Noto - Goldman Sachs: Tom, do you think the forecasted acceleration in revenue growth to 25% year-over-year, which is faster than this quarter and the third quarter, and a seasonally stronger growth rate of 65% compared to last year at 60%, is completely due to the lower prices or is it also due to groceries and other categories you may not have announced yet? \nTom Szkutak: It is due to a number of things that we talked about. We are investing heavily in the toy category for the second half, some of the new categories we have launched. We are expanding selection in the existing categories. We're putting more selection under our own roof, which we also think is helpful, as well as the pricing.  But in terms of what I was describing with the impact on the bottom line, and those are the elements, but certainly on the top-line perspective, it is pricing, additional selection and new categories. \nAnthony Noto - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Rowen - Prudential. \nMark Rowen - Prudential: Thanks. When you do your own toys, is that going to cause your gross margin to drop significantly in the back half of the year from where it was, given that your third-party gross margins were probably higher? \nJeff Bezos: Yes, we haven't broken out the full financials on our relationship with TRU, or we don't give guidance on any specific category. As we look forward, we certainly have reflected what we think will happen in the toys category in the guidance that we have given for both Q3 and the total year. \nMark Rowen - Prudential: Well, I guess the reason I'm asking is with the lower reported operating margin that you guided to, is that primarily a function of gross margin or higher expenses? \nJeff Bezos: Yes, it is, again, it incorporates all of the factors that we have seen to date and what we expect for the second half. But the investment specifically in toys, as we talk about it, is a number of different things.  It is certainly an investment in the people to run that category. It is an investment in the selection, which we have built up very quickly to launch in early July, and we'll continue to add to that selection over time. It is an investment in the fact that we're offering today free shipping, Super Saving Shipping, as well as free shipping through Amazon Prime. So that's certainly a significant investment, as well as we want to make sure that we have very competitive pricing as we launch this new category for us on our detail pages. So it is a combination of all of those. That is what is reflected in both our Q3 and total year guidance. \nMark Rowen - Prudential: Do you think in the toy category that you'll be able to sell as many toy units as Toys 'R' Us did? Or is it going to take time to build up the customer awareness? In other words, did the Toys 'R' Us brand attract a certain number of those customers and unit sales? \nJeff Bezos: You know, we are not giving unit guidance on the toy category. But I would say that we are optimistic. We think we are going to offer an incredible experience to customers. We think this is, over the long term, is very good for customers and for shareholders. We are excited about the experience that we can give, not only with the selection, but with the service, particularly with Prime and Super Saver Shipping. So we think the total package is going to be great for customers and shareholders long term. We think customers are going to like it short term. We think it is going to be expensive short term. \nMark Rowen - Prudential: Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers. \nDoug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. I just wanted to get some more detail on your free cash flow, and specifically the $13 million that you essentially withheld from Toys 'R' Us during the quarter. I just wanted to get clarity on how that is being booked in your cash flow statement, and then also just clarify that we're not really seeing that in the income statement. Also, why did you see no real benefit in terms of accounts payable during the quarter? Thank you. \nTom Szkutak: Sure. First of all, this is active litigation in terms of Toys 'R' Us. But from an accounting standpoint, we did withhold the $13 million, so it is reflected positively in our free cash flow and operating cash flows. From an accounting standpoint, there's $20 million of revenue that we did not recognize during the quarter that has also an impact of $20 million on CSOI. So it's $20 million of revenue in CSOI that we did not recognize.  I'm not sure if I understand the payables question. Our payable days were 53 days for the quarter. That is up from 51 days last year. So it is an improvement of two days year-over-year. \nDoug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers: With the change in accounts payable, is that a positive benefit of $4 million during the quarter? Just looking back historically, you have always obviously had a much bigger benefit in the second quarter. \nTom Szkutak: What you are probably looking at is, and you can see it in some of the timing, the two-day improvement year-over-year actually was very solid compared to most of the quarters over the past several quarters. If you look at Q1 year-over-year, it was actually a little bit better improvement, which is closer to four days, which was probably the best we have had in several quarters.  So again, it was still a very good improvement and year-over-year, 53 versus 51 days. It also improved sequentially from 48 to 53 days. So again, it was I think a solid improvement year-over-year. \nDoug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch. \nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I noticed that the shipping costs went up from 21% growth last quarter to 27% growth this quarter. I am assuming that's for Amazon Prime. Can you talk a little bit about the benefits of Amazon Prime? What do those customers give you that the non-Prime customers don\u2019t give you? Why are you still keeping with the program? Are you still positive on it?  Secondly, on the media items, more and more media seems to be going digital. Can you talk about any thoughts you have on the margin outlook for media sales as they become digital and if you think there will be any changes to Amazon's margin structure if you bring more digital items to consumers? \nJeff Bezos: The reason that we like Amazon Prime -- yes, we're still very positive on it. In fact, we are more positive on it than we ever have been as we see the adoption. It's because we see a lift in sales when people, their kind of pre- and post-behavior after they become Amazon Prime members. The experience that we are giving to the customer is improved because they're getting their products very rapidly. So they get more instant gratification. While they still free shipping, they get two-day delivery; whereas before, they could get free shipping, and they did often get free shipping, but it was with our Super Saver Shipping, which isn't a two-day delivery.  So really, that is the thing that we like about it. There are several things, but the big one is we see an increase in sales from those Amazon Prime members, and it deepens our relationship with those customers. They shop in more categories with us. It is a program that would be very hard for most companies to pursue. It requires that you be a multi-category retailer to do it, in an effective way. It requires that you have excellent transportation costs. It requires a certain amount of scale so that you can have a multi-node network.  So it is differentiated. It is something that customers love. It is durable in time. It creates an uplift in sales. So while this is certainly an expensive investment, it really does build what will be a more important and bigger company over the long term. \nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch: Then on the digital distribution of maybe music and video, how do you see that affecting margins over the long term? \nTom Szkutak: It's very early and certainly difficult to predict what will happen over time. So certainly it is something that we are staying very close to. But it is difficult to estimate what that impact will be over time. \nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Imran Khan - JP Morgan. \nImran Khan - JP Morgan: Good afternoon, Jeff and Tom. Two questions. First, if I look at your midpoint of your guidance in Q3 and Q4, it seems like you are expecting significant margin expansion in Q4 from Q3 levels. I'm trying to understand what gives you that confidence, considering you are getting into some of the businesses that have lower gross margins like grocery and maybe toy.  Clearly, you're investing a lot of dollars in the technology area. Investors or the analysts like us, we are outside. How can I keep track of your progress? How can I keep track of this scorecard that we'll really see some sort of return on investment of those investments? \nTom Szkutak: Sure. First of all, on the guidance question, if you look at Q3, I just want to remind you, as you look at the top line guidance, that in Q3 we are overlapping Harry Potter 6. As we had mentioned last year during our call for Q3, that the impact of Harry Potter 6 on our overall top line was approximately 260 basis points. So we are overlapping that, because you're looking at the growth rates in Q3 and Q4, keep that in mind.  As you are looking at the bottom line, beyond the factors that I have already described in our guidance, keep in mind that in Q4 of last year or throughout last year, we have built up our spend in technology and content. In Q4 specifically, we're overlapping that spend. As we mentioned, we expect that our technology and content growth rate is going to decline in the second half versus first half. So that is what is impacting Q4 most predominately.  In terms of the other question related to technology and content, how you measure our progress in terms of output, I think that that's something that you will have to wait and see as we launch new products and services over time. \nImran Khan - JP Morgan: Great, thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray. \nPaul Beaver - Piper Jaffray: This is Paul Beaver for Safa. I was just wondering if you are seeing any pressure from gas prices or a slowing economy? Similarly, will you be able to get incremental leverage from your vendors in this slowing economy? \nTom Szkutak: I will take the second part of your question. I think certainly our leverage with suppliers will certainly be most prominent as we continue to grow. That's an up and down economy. As we get further scale in our individual categories it just helps our overall COGS. It also helps leverage our fixed cost structure. So again, that's where you'll see it both in up and down economies.  In terms of gas prices -- I am assuming that is on demand -- with the growth rates that we have, I don't think that we are necessarily a great bellwether for the economy. So it is hard to say, but again, I think that's all I have to say on that particular question. \nPaul Beaver - Piper Jaffray: A quick follow-up. What is your strategy with the grocery segment? It seems like a fairly low-margin category to pursue. Can you just provide some color for us? \nJeff Bezos: Well, the way we are doing this category is very different from the way it has been done in the past. The quantity sizes tend toward stock-up quantity sizes, which gets the ASP of the item higher. We are accustomed to operating with relatively low ASP items. When you look at the amount of gross profit dollars in an item that we handle profitably at Amazon.com, it can be very low. That is a capability that we have built up over time.  So we are selecting the items that go into that store to be items that we think over time can build a profitable business for us. The consumer reaction in these early days to that offering has been extremely positive, in large part because the selection of that offering is already so strong, and it will just get better from here. So we don't just carry a few flavors of Jello; we carry all 80. \nPaul Beaver - Piper Jaffray: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup. \nMark Mahaney - Citigroup: A question for Jeff. Jeff, when you talked about the three flywheels -- selection, price and availability -- I'm wondering if you think about the digital media offerings that are out there in the market now, do you sense that one of those flywheels or two of those flywheels aren't there in strength? Where would be the weakness of those three flywheels amongst the existing digital media offerings that are out in the marketplace? Thank you. \nJeff Bezos: Sure. Digital will have its own set of flywheels, and we are not prepared to talk about that at this time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns. \nRobert Peck - Bear Stearns: Quick questions around the changing environment around you. First of all, with the eBay fee increase impending, could you talk a little bit about any additional inquiries you've gotten from third-party sellers and how you think that could impact you going into third or fourth quarter?  Secondly, could you also address the rollout of eBay Express really starting in September/October and how you think that could impact business going forward and maybe some of your advantages?  Lastly, with Google Checkout, could you talk a little bit about any impacts that you could see from that? Is there any sort of patent violation there as far as one-click checkout? Any comments around those three products would be great. Thanks. \nJeff Bezos: I would just say that as a long-standing practice, we don't talk about other companies. We will certainly stick with that. The retail business and the fixed-price business is one that has always had a tremendous amount of competition. These are very large markets. There is room for thousands of winners. We are customer focused and will stay that way. That doesn't mean we don't pay attention to what competitors do; we do. We watch and we try to learn. But these are big markets and there's plenty of room. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse. \nHeath Terry - Credit Suisse: Great. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on the Marks & Spencer relationship in Europe? Where are you guys in the process of actually getting that into production? Also, in your international business, how should we be thinking about new product rollouts there as your international product offerings continue to lag what we're seeing here in the U.S.? \nJeff Bezos: Sure. I will take the second part first. In terms of our international business, we think there's still a lot of opportunity to grow and add new selection and new product categories. We've seen some of those launches recently, certainly with sports, as we mentioned on the opening comments.  So again, we are very excited about the opportunity we have in international. We think there's a lot of selection and new categories to go into. We think there is, over time, certainly geographical expansion in addition to what we have done to date that are high.  In terms of Marks & Spencer, as we have mentioned previously, we will be launching their website in the second half of this year. \nKim Nelson: Thanks Heath, and thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. \nJeff Bezos: Thank you. \nTom Szkutak: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect. \nDid you know?:\nTRANSCRIPT SPONSOR:  \n :"}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2006, "date": "2006-04-25 18:55:12", "content": "TRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :\nExecutives: Jeff Bezos - Founder and CEO   Tom Szkutak - CFO   Kim Nelson - Director, Investor Relations \nAnalysts: Mark Mahaney - Citigroup   Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs   Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray   Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers   Imran Khan - JP Morgan   Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank   Justin Post - Merrill Lynch   Robert Peck - Bear Stearns   Mark Rowen - Prudential   Shawn Milne - Friedman Billings Ramsey \nOperator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com first quarter 2006 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions). For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Kim Nelson. Please go ahead, Ms. Nelson. \nKim Nelson: Hello and welcome to our Q1 '06 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2006 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.  Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2005 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2005. Now I will turn the call over to Tom. \nTRANSCRIPT SPONSOR:  \n :\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Kim. This was another successful quarter for Amazon.com. I will start with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 20% to $501 million. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Trailing 12-month free cash flow includes a one-time payment of $40 million in connection with the patent lawsuit settlement in Q305 and excludes $13 million of tax benefits from stock-based compensation that are classified as positive financing cash flows under FAS 123R. Adjusting for these two items, TTM free cash flow grew 32% to $554 million.  As a reminder, the financial measure we're working to maximize over the long-term is free cash flow per share. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 438 million shares compared with 434 million, up 1%. Stock-based awards outstanding were 21 million or 4.9% of shares outstanding, down from 24 million or 5.7% of shares outstanding. We strive to efficiently manage share count.  Return on invested capital was 32%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities.  Revenue grew 20% to $2.28 billion or 25%, excluding the $94 million unfavorable impact in year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Worldwide unit growth was 24%.  Third-party units representing marketplace and merchant's units sold on Amazon sites were 29% of total units, up from 27%. Active customer accounts, representing customers who have ordered in the past year, surpassed 57 million, up 19%.  Electronics and other general merchandise, or EGM, increased 33% to $639 million or 38% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM represents 28% of worldwide sales, up from 25%. Gross profit grew 19% to $547 million in Q1, and gross margin decreased 9 basis points to 24%, primarily due to greater shipping loss driven by free shipping in Amazon Prime and our lower product prices. These decreases were partially offset by increased third-party sales.  Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense under FAS 123R which we early adopted in Q105. Fulfillment, marketing, technical content and G&A combined was $427 million or 18.8% of sales, up 141 basis points. Fulfillment was $190 million or 8.3% of sales, down 24 basis points.  In 2006 we expect to increase our fulfillment space less than in 2005 to extend our capacity to satisfy peak demand. For example, we are opening a new fulfillment center in Leipzig, Germany which we expect will be operational by Q3 this year.  Marketing was $54 million or 2.4% of sales, up 11 basis points. Technology and content increased 69% year-over-year to $138 million, and we expect this percentage to decrease substantially in the back half of this year. Q106 represents 6.1% of sales, up 177 basis points. G&A was $45 million or 0.2% of sales, down 24 basis points. As a reminder in Q105, we recorded an $8 million charge related to litigation matters.  Now I will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expense to our segments. In the North American segment, revenue grew 21% to $1.25 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $815 million, and EGM revenue grew 33% to $374 million, representing 30% of North America revenues, up from 27%. Apparel, jewelry and sporting goods revenue all more than doubled year-over-year.  Gross profit grew 22% to $341 million, and gross margin increased 18 basis points to 27.3%, largely due to third-party sales, as well as an $11 million increase in other revenue primarily driven by Amazon Enterprise Solutions; partially offset by Amazon Prime, our price reductions across product categories, product mix shift and free shipping.  North America segment operating income decreased $4 million to $62 million, a 5% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 18% to $1.03 billion. Revenue growth accelerated to 29%, adjusting for the $96 million year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter.  Media revenue grew 13% to $763 million or 24%, excluding FX, the highest growth rate since Q4 of 2004. EGM revenue grew 33% to $265 million, or 45% excluding FX, representing 26% of international revenues, up from 23%. Gross profit grew 15% to $206 million or 26% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 53 basis points to 20% primarily from free shipping, product price reductions and a mix shift.  International segment operating income decreased $4 million to $58 million, a 5.6% operating margin. Excluding FX, international operating income increased 6%. The combination of operating income in North America and International segment is our consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI. Our segment information and our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income.  CSOI declined 7% to $120 million or flat year-over-year, excluding the $8 million unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rates. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 2% to $106 million. Excluding the $8 million impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income increased 6% to $114 million.  Our provision for income taxes was $45 million in Q1, or a 47% rate for the quarter, reflecting our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate remains higher than the 35% statutory rate, primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg.  We expect these asset transfers to result in tax expense for the financial reporting year above the 35% statutory rate throughout 2006 and beneficially impacting our effective tax rate over time. Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis.  GAAP net income was $51 million or $0.12 per diluted share compared with $78 million and $0.18 per diluted share. Q105 includes a $26 million or $0.06 per diluted share gain for the accumulative effect of a change in accounting principles related to the adoption of FAS 123R.  Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities increased $184 million to $1.3 billion. In Q106 we redeemed EUR 250 million or $300 million in principal amount of our 6 7/8. This redemption mitigates potential dilution of over 2.9 million shares and reduces our annual cash interest expense by approximately $21 million.  Inventory increased 33% to $538 million, and turns decreased 7% to 14.4 as we expanded the breadth of our product category selections and our fulfillment centers and took advantage of buying opportunities from vendors. We will continue to increase our mix of direct buying in existing and new product categories, enabling us to offer even lower prices to customers.  Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased 47% from a year ago to $361 million. Our capital expenditures were $46 million for Q1. $26 million of CapEx was software development costs.  Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary input to customer experience: convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress include Amazon Prime. We're pleased to see strong quarter to quarter sequential growth for new Amazon Prime subscriptions. We continue to see increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories, with especially heavy use in electronics, kitchen and health and personal care. For $79 a year, Amazon Prime members get all-you-can-eat, free two-day shipment.  We introduced 'click to call', a new feature for our US, UK, German and French websites which allows customers to be connected quickly with a customer service representative who will often already have the customer's account information in front of them, saving the customer time and increasing satisfaction.  Amazon's Japanese website introduced several new payment methods which allow customers to pay for their Amazon.co.jp purchases with online banking at approximately 70,000 convenience stores and ATMs throughout Japan.  Amazon's German and UK websites launched wedding registries enabling couples to choose gifts from millions of products for their household, including kitchen and home appliances, cookware, cutlery, electronics and more.  Amazon Web Services launched Amazon S3, a simple storage service for software developers. S3 provides an application programming interface for highly scalable, reliable, low latency data storage at very low cost. Developers continue to adopt Web Services. Over 160,000 have registered to date, upgraded to 60% year-over-year.  Amazon's German website, Amazon.de, introduced the Advantage program. This enables increased selection and 24-hour availability for customers by allowing vendors to store their products on consignment in Amazon's fulfillment center.  We acquired ShopBop.com, a retailer of fashion forward apparel, shoes and accessories for women, featuring products from more than 75 leading designers including Marc Jacobs, Juicy Couture and True Religion. Third-party sellers remained a key part of our selection expansion in worldwide active seller accounts, merchants with an order from a customer during the preceding 12 months exceeded 1.08 million, up 15% year-over-year.  Amazon Enterprise Solutions announced two new partners -- Benefit Cosmetics, a subsidiary of luxury group LVMH, and Timex.  Some pricing highlights include the average customer discounts across books, music and video products purchased on www.Amazon.com increased more than 150 basis points year-over-year. Customers have enjoyed our '4 for 3' offer in books on Amazon.com. Order four books under $10 and pay for only three. Over the past 12 months, customers have saved approximately $0.5 billion on shipping throughout our worldwide free shipping offers and Amazon Prime.  I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuations in the euro pound, yen, Canadian dollar and Yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events.  While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have zero exposure related to our interest expense and on this euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with the inter-company balances denominated in foreign currencies which are settled amongst subsidiaries.  Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, the income position or cash flows in a particular period.  Our effective tax rate in 2006 is subject to significant variations based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently non-deductible for U.S. tax purposes such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees, the tax characterization of income earned and changes in current tax laws and estimates, including the variability in predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates.  Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or restructuring-related estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.  We are appealing a recent court decision that terminates our ToysRUs.com contract, and we are seeking a stay of the termination pending a decision on our appeal. While we believe we will prevail and that ToysRUs.com's claims lack merit, the timing and possible outcomes of this litigation are uncertain, and possible effects of termination are not reflected in the following guidance. If we do not prevail, operating profit could be negatively impacted by as much as $50 million for the year, including as much as $25 million for the second quarter.  For Q2 we expect net sales of between $2.03 billion and $2.18 billion or growth of between 16% to 24%. This guidance anticipates greater than $50 million or over 280 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange due to the dollar's continued strength.  GAAP operating income to be between $32 million and $67 million or between a 69% decline and a 36% decline. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $38 million.  We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes a negative impact from foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $70 million and $105 million or between 47% decline and 20% decline.  For calendar year 2006, we expect net sales of between $9.95 billion and $10.5 billion or growth of between 17% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately $150 million or over 175 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange.  GAAP operating income to be between $390 million and $520 million or between a 10% decline and 20% growth. This includes approximately $125 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.  We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes a negative impact for foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $515 million and $645 million or a 9% decline and 14% growth.  Operating leverage to improve in the second half of the year compared with the first half of the year. We expect our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year-over-year. This excludes the impact of FAS 123R which should be less than $100 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation being classified as positive financing cash flows instead of operating cash flows, up from $7 million in 2005.  We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $225 million.  We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth and free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well as our free cash flow, will further expand. Thanks and with that, let's move to questions. \nKim Nelson: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to ask a question? \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney, Citigroup. \nMark Mahaney - Citigroup: Thank you very much. Two questions, please. First, on the Toys \"R\" Us, is it your expectation that you will get some sort of decision in the June quarter? Is why you think -- is that why you're sizing that at $25 million? Or is it very uncertain at what point in the balance of the year you'll reach a decision?  Secondly, could you talk about any trends in your technology and content spending? Are you spending in areas that are different than you have been spending over the last, say, two quarters and just in that second content area? \nTom Szkutak:  Sure. I will take the second part of your question first. In terms of technology and content, no -- we're spending in the same areas that we have been talking about consistently, and we are making investments in customer experience, digital, web services, search, improving the seller platform and other productivity initiatives. So that is the same.  In terms of Toys \"R\" Us, certainly this ongoing litigation, to try and predict when that is going to resolve; I think it is uncertain and difficult to say. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs. \nAnthony Noto - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Tom, I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit, your second quarter guidance for consolidated operating income implies at the midpoint about a 4% operating margin, which is obviously down year-over-year and also relative to the first quarter. So it seems like there will be a more significant ramp in the second quarter in spending. Then it requires a pretty meaningful expansion in the back half of the year to about 6.3%.  I was just trying to understand what products are you investing in in the first half of this year that we will see, from a consumer facing standpoint, that could potentially drive that acceleration of revenue in the back half of the year and that margin expansion? It is really hard to have the visibility without knowing those products. Thank you. \nTom Szkutak:  Sure. Just to maybe talk a little bit about Q2 in the second half. In terms of Q2, what you're seeing is Q2 historically is our lowest seasonal quarter from a revenue standpoint. We certainly have lowered prices considerably, which is certainly impacting the bottom line guidance for Q2.  We also have, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, higher fixed costs in the first half, and that growth rate will be going down in the second half. So in other words the growth rate in the second half of '06 will be lower versus the second half of 2005.  So in terms of the growth in terms of individual products and any new launches, we have not in the past announced any new categories before the launch. But certainly with the growth that you're seeing in Q1, we saw accelerated growth from 22% in Q4 to 24.8%. So we saw some nice accelerated growth and we like what we see. We're going to continue to focus on those inputs that helped drive Q1, throughout the year. So that is why you're seeing the better leverage in the second half as well as the updated guidance that we gave for the total year as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray. \nSafa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray: My question again relates to Toys \"R\" Us. Given that you lost the current or last ruling, could you give us some idea as to why you are confident that you would win? Why would it make sense not to include revenues or profits from Toys \"R\" Us and kind of wait to see how the ruling would be? \nTom Szkutak: Sure. Again, beyond the filings that we have made to date, we have a practice of not talking about ongoing litigation. I wanted to provide some data in the opening remarks to give some context of how we are thinking about it. I think certainly that is appropriate. But beyond that, I don't have a lot to say on Toys \"R\" Us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth, Lehman Brothers. \nDoug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers: I just have two quick questions. One actually does relate to Toys \"R\" Us. But I'm just trying to figure out why in 2Q you get so much of the impact there, of the $25 million potentially? So that is question number one.  The second one is your hiring, I noticed that it was only about an incremental 400 people in terms of head count in 1Q, which is a pretty dramatic slowdown -- at least on an absolute basis -- from what we saw throughout each quarter in 2005. Is that a pretty fair way to think about your head count growth going forward? \nTom Szkutak:  Yes. In terms of Toys \"R\" Us, there is certainly a range of possible outcomes. So the Q2 impact and the total year, we are trying to give what we think is an appropriately conservative look at the situation there as we know it today. So that is how we are thinking about TRU.  In terms of the hiring, we are still continuing to hire. As you mentioned, you did see a sequential growth of 400 from year end to the end of Q1, which is lighter than we have seen in the past. As we had mentioned in the previous call, we made a deliberate decision in 2005 to increase head count specifically in technology areas. We hired a lot of software development engineers and computer scientists. You will see that over the next few years, we want to grow into that investment base. So that is really what you're seeing. So that I think answers your question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Imran Khan, JP Morgan. \nImran Khan - JP Morgan: Thank you. Good afternoon, Tom and Jeff. Actually two questions, one going back to Anthony's question. If I look at the back half of your guidance, it seems like you're expecting 66% or so -- if I take a mid-point operating profit -- coming in the second half of this year. That is not reflective of the 50% to 55% we saw in the last two years.  You talked a little bit about fixed costs will be basically first half. I was trying to get a sense, if you can talk about the quarter from those fixed costs? In terms of the technology spending, it grew 68% year-over-year. How should we think about going to Q2, Q3, Q4? How do you see the technological spending flowing, that will help them? \nTom Szkutak:  Sure. The technology and content, the 69% excluding stock-based comp growth, you should see a substantial growth reduction in the second half of the year versus the second half of 2005. Then the fixed cost piece, could you just repeat that part of the question? \nImran Khan - JP Morgan: So I was wondering if you could give us some sense, what are some of those fixed costs that you have in first half but you don't have in second half? \nTom Szkutak:  Sure. Part of it is just the build-up that you saw in the latter half of last year. So if you look at the operating expense over the course of last year, we have had a sizable build-up through the course of last year with Q4 being certainly the highest. You will be starting to see the lapping of that increase in the second half of the year. \nImran Khan - JP Morgan: Okay. If I may ask one follow-up question in terms of Amazon Prime. You said that you have had pretty good success with Amazon Prime. I was wondering if you could give us some color like how many customers are using Amazon Prime right now and what kind of ASP improvement you saw because of Amazon Prime? Some maybe ballpark color, I would appreciate that. \nJeff Bezos: We're not providing any numbers on Amazon Prime. What I can tell you is that we have seen very exciting growth sequentially Q4 to Q1, even though we came off a very strong Q4 for Amazon Prime. New subscriptions are up even sequentially off of our seasonally heavy quarter. So we continue to and we are able to track a bunch of numbers with Amazon Prime in terms of what it does to wallet share and increased spending, those kinds of metrics, renewal rates, et cetera. We're a very happy with what we're seeing, but we're not discussing those figures publicly.  On your earlier question, I just wanted to add to Tom's answer just to make sure that you understood. It is not so much that the fixed costs are being reduced in the back half of the year. In fact, those technology and content, for example, will probably go up in absolute dollars. It is just that as the Company continues to grow, the year-over-year growth in those numbers is less, and then as the top line grows, also we start to grow into that cost structure over the next few years. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank. \nJeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank: Great. Two questions. First of all, on Amazon Prime I guess you're seeing frequency growth overall in the business of about 5% to 6% year on year. Can you talk about the impact that Amazon Prime has? Are you seeing even faster frequency growth in that audience, or do you think it's actually attracting a different customer that may not have looked at Amazon previously in terms of the active account base?  Second question: broadly, as you take a step back and look at the marketplace, it seems like subscriptions, rentals and also new product purchases and sales, they all represent just different ways of accessing content and information and products out there. How do you see your customer adapting to those different types of businesses or concepts out there? Do you think they are open to different solutions, different ways of accessing content, or do you think that it becomes still more of a retail business? \nTom Szkutak:  I think our customers are very receptive to new kinds of offerings from us. Over time we have stretched the corners of how customers perceive us, and we have done that very successfully, transitioning from an online bookseller to being able to sell hardlines and now many more categories.  At the same time, we have had success with two very, very different kinds of business models from a consumer point of view. One being the retail business model and the second one being the third-party business model, which as you know now is a significant percentage of our units where third-party sellers sell through the Amazon.com website.  So not only have we kind of stretched the corners of how customers perceive us in terms of product category, but also in terms of business model. I think what we're seeing with Amazon Prime in our rental offerings is yet another business model that customers are giving us permission to pursue with them.  So not only are we happy with the new subscription growth that we have seen in Amazon Prime, but if you look at our DVD rental business in the UK and Germany, those businesses are going very well, too. Having started free trial offers there, we're even seeing acceleration in those businesses as well, and that is off of a base that we were already happy with. \nJeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank: Jeff, do you think that some of these business models can still exist inside the same category at the same time so DVD rental, DVD club service versus DVD purchases all in one? \nJeff Bezos:  Yes. In fact, we have announced that we're going to be doing a program called Upgrade that will allow people to buy physical books and then for a small incremental charge get online access to those books as well. So we do think that there are offerings which can co-exist.  I would point to our third-party sales business where people can buy the new version of the book or the used version of the book or the reconditioned tool or the new tool or the new camera from somebody else. Instead of buying a new camera from us, go right from the Amazon website. That is another example of where you have two quite dissimilar business models interacting very nicely even on the same detail page. \nJeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank: Do you employ a lot of the data between different products, different business models today or not really in terms of the used pricing versus new pricing, etc.? \nJeff Bezos:  I'm sorry. Could you say that again? \nJeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank: So are you leveraging a lot of the data and knowledge base from what you learn in used, what consumers are willing to pay for a particular product to, let's say, in the content area, what they are willing to pay for by chapter or by different formats for a used model versus a pure buy model? \nJeff Bezos : Not necessarily that particular example, but we do have things. For example, we can see which subcategories of books performed best inside things like Search Inside! the Book. So when we offer Search Inside! the Book, which allows people to do full text searches and view certain portions of books, we can see which subcategories of books do services like that perform better in. Then we can think about how can we extend those offerings in those kinds of subcategories. So we do have a lot of very helpful data that we can view and use it as aid in making business decisions. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post, Merrill Lynch. \nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch: I think on the call you mentioned you would be able to cut pricing by about 150 basis points year-over-year to the consumer. I'm wondering if you are able to get better deals from your vendors? Are you able to pass that through, and that's what you're able to maintain the margins?  The second thing, the shipping expense was up pretty consistent with the revenue growth. Do you expect any pressure from gas prices or Amazon Prime going forward? Then could you just remind me of the FAS 123 benefit that you got in the first quarter? \nTom Szkutak:  Sure. In terms of impact on COGS in your pricing question, yes, it is an ongoing effort everyday to try to get better prices from our suppliers, and certainly our goal is to help pass that on in terms of lower prices to customers. So that is an everyday activity that we do globally.  In terms of shipping expense, in terms of the inflation that you mentioned, certainly that is something that we have been dealing with for several years with oil prices and energy prices where they are. We have seen a dramatic increase over the last several years. So it is just something that we have been managing over the past several years. I'm not sure what more to say about that. Then the last part of your question, I'm sorry? \nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch: Yes, the FAS 123 benefit that you got in the first quarter, I think you gave that number. \nTom Szkutak: Yes, it is $13 million over the past 12 months and it is $7 million in Q1. \nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch:  Okay. We will get back to that later. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Peck, Bear Stearns. \nTom Szkutak:  I'm sorry, you were talking about expense or the impact on free cash flow? I'm not sure -- you're talking about the stock-based compensation expense or the impact on free cash flow? \nOperator:  I'm sorry, Mr. Post. Could you please requeue? \nTom Szkutak: Well, if he is not back on. The expense piece was $11 million. Stock-based compensation was $11 million in Q1, which was down from $19 million from last year. Then the impact of 123R on free cash flow was $7 million in Q1 or $13 million over the trailing 12 months, if that is helpful. That covered both bases. \nRobert Peck - Bear Stearns:  Tom, this is Bob Peck. Am I live? \nTom Szkutak:  Yes. \nRobert Peck - Bear Stearns:  Okay. Great. I got two questions for you. The first is sort of a two-parter, though. Are you able to break out your tech spending as far as investment versus maintenance, and investment meaning your newer initiatives, not necessarily along the course, just A9, S3, et cetera.?  And part two of that is considering a lot of the initiatives you're taking are very similar to things that Google is doing, does it ever make sense for you to consider any sort of partnership with Google? Then I have got a follow-up. \nTom Szkutak: Okay. In terms of our technology and content spend, we look at it a number of different ways. We look at it certainly from a maintenance mode, an investment mode. But we look at it on an individual program basis as well. So again, we're looking at all the individual programs that we do. We review that regularly, so it is part of our planning process. In terms of partnerships and any other discussion, you know we have a long-standing practice of not talking about any particular company. \nRobert Peck - Bear Stearns: Okay. Because you can see the synergies there if you did. The second question would be on Amazon Prime, really quickly. The Amazon Prime subs right now, are they profitable? With the release of eBay Express, what is your opinion of the impact of eBay Express on Amazon longer-term? Thank you. \nTom Szkutak: We do not as a matter of practice talk about other companies and definitely stick to that. I would say more generally there are going to be and there have been thousands of competitors, and there should be in this space. These are very big markets, and there can be lots of winners. What was the other part of your question? \nRobert Peck - Bear Stearns:  Are the Prime subs profitable? \nTom Szkutak: They are profitable on their own basis, so that each one is profitable. They are less profitable than if they did that same amount of shopping without getting free shipping. So the two-day free shipping makes them much less profitable than they would be otherwise. So do you understand what I'm saying? \nRobert Peck - Bear Stearns:  I do. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Rowen, Prudential. \nMark Rowen - Prudential: A couple of quick questions. One on the Toys \"R\" Us, you're saying that it is going to be $100 million impact for the year if it works out unfavorably to you. I noticed in the lawsuit that they were really fighting about the $50 million payment. So in that $100 million, are you assuming that you don't replace them with another third-party seller or your own sales? Is that like a worst-case scenario? \nTom Szkutak:  I don't know where the numbers you are describing are coming from, the $100 million. What we had mentioned was that it could be up to $50 million for the year in operating profit. \nMark Rowen - Prudential:  Okay. So $50 million for the year. So is that the excess payment that they made that you could not replace by putting another third-party seller in there, or do you think you could make some of that up if you did put another third-party seller in there with a higher commission or whatever? \nJeff Bezos: Yes, Mark, as you can probably appreciate, this is a matter of ongoing litigation, and I don't think it is appropriate to talk further about it. I think we have given adequate commentary in the opening remarks about it. At this stage, I would like to keep it to that. \nMark Rowen - Prudential:  Okay. My second question, it relates to your North American media business. A lot of the other sellers of those products, particularly in music and movies, have been struggling over the last year, music probably longer than that. Are those categories still good for you? Are you still gaining share in a shrinking market, or are the effects of the market shrinking impacting those categories? Is it really books that is driving that category? \nTom Szkutak:  When you look at the growth rates for North American media, we are still seeing very solid double-digit growth. It is up 15% year over year, 16% on a TTM basis. So we think it is a very good business for us. There has certainly been a lot of innovation and improvements in customer experience over the past few years within that space, which we think is paying off for us. \nMark Rowen - Prudential : So it is paying off in all of those categories, not just books? \nTom Szkutak: Yes, we have not broken out any of the individual categories within media, but we are certainly pleased with the individual categories that make that up. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Shawn Milne, Friedman Billings Ramsey. \nShawn Milne - Friedman Billings Ramsey: A quick question, Tom, on the flow of your business in the first quarter. If you look at some data from the third party, it looks like online spending was strong in January. It was a bit weaker in February and then rebounded in March. Can you talk about the flow of your business if you saw any of those trends?  The March data actually would suggest an acceleration in online spending heading into April. Any thoughts on that? Thanks. \nTom Szkutak:  Again, we are certainly running a business in a number of different countries. So I don't think it's appropriate to talk about individual months. But certainly when you look at our overall growth for the quarter, you're seeing an acceleration. You saw 22% growth in Q4 on a local currency basis, just under 25% in Q1. So again, you saw an acceleration there. But talking much more beyond that in terms of individual months, we're not going to do today. \nShawn Milne - Friedman Billings Ramsey: You talked about buying directly more in inventory. Are you buying toy inventory currently? \nTom Szkutak: No, I'm not going to comment more on the toy business. \nKim Nelson : Thank you for your questions. A replay will be available at our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. \nTom Szkutak:  Thank you. \nJeff Bezos:  Thank you. \nTRANSCRIPT SPONSOR:  \n :"}], "2008": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2007, "date": "2008-01-31 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2007 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.\nRob Eldridge: Hello and welcome to our Q407 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom  Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, January 30, 2008 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2006 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today\u2019s call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2006. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thanks, Rob. This was another successful year for Amazon.com. Let me start by reviewing 2007 financial results. Free cash flow grew 143% to $1.18 billion. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 435 million shares compared with 436 million shares. Return on invested capital was 55%, up from 28%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities over five quarter ends. Revenue grew 39% to $14.84 billion, or 35% excluding the $399 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. This was our fastest annual growth rate since 2000. North America revenue grew 38% to $8.1 billion and international grew 39% to $6.74 billion. 31% year over year, excluding the year-over-year changes in FX. Additionally, EGM revenue surpassed $3 billion in North America and $2 billion in international for the first time. Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, grew 70% to $849 million, or 64% excluding $29 million of favorable year over year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin increased 105 basis points to 5.7%. GAAP operating income grew 69% to $655 million, or 4.4% of net sales. Now I\u2019ll discuss the fourth quarter. Worldwide revenue grew 42% to $5.67 billion, or 37% excluding the $195 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $3.33 billion, up 33% or 28% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $2.21 billion, up 58% or 54% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 39% of worldwide sales, up from 35%. Worldwide unit growth was 33%. Active customer accounts exceeded 76 million, up 19%. Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately 1.3 million, up 15%. Seller units were 26% of total units versus 25%. Worldwide gross profit was $1.17 billion, up 38%. Gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 20.6%, primarily due to lowering prices for customers and change in product mix, partially offset by increases in our seller business. Now I\u2019ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $842 million, or 14.8% of sales, an improvement of 75 basis points year over year. Tech and content was $190 million, or 3.4% of revenue compared with 4.1%. Now I\u2019ll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 40% to $3.08 billion, outpacing last year\u2019s Q4 growth of 31%. Media revenue grew 31% to $1.64 billion, where we saw increases in all categories. EGM revenue grew 53% to $1.34 billion, representing 43% of North America revenues, up from 40%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and baby, soft goods, which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes, and sporting goods. North America gross profit grew 31% to $698 million, and gross margin decreased 143 basis points to 22.6%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 25% to $153 million, a 5% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 46% to $2.59 billion. Revenue growth was 35% adjusting for the $188 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 36% to $1.69 billion, or 26% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 68% to $877 million, or 55% excluding FX. This was the fastest growth rate for international EGM in more than two years. EGM now represents 34% of international revenues, up from 29%. International gross profit grew 48% to $472 million, or grew 37% excluding foreign exchange rates, while gross margin increased 32 basis points to 18.2%, reflecting an increase in sales of products by sellers, partially offset by lower end prices to customers, including free shipping and changes in product mix. International segment operating income increased 65% to $175 million, a 6.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international operating income increased 49%. CSOI grew 44% to $328 million, or 5.8% of revenue, up six basis points. The year-ago quarter included an $8 million insurance recovery benefit in G&A. Excluding this benefit, CSOI for the quarter would have grown 49% and been up 26 basis points. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 38% to $271 million, or 4.8% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $74 million in Q4, or a 26% rate for the quarter, which includes a $4 million benefit adjusted to reflect our annual effective tax rate of 28%. In 2007, we paid $24 million in cash taxes. The majority of our tax expense is non-cash because we have current tax benefits and NOLs related to excess stock-based compensation. We expect our effective tax rate in 2008 to be approximately 30% and we estimate cash taxes paid to be less than $75 million. However, there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and business acquisitions or investments. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. GAAP net income was $207 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared with $98 million and $0.23 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.2 billion to $3.31 billion. In Q107, we repurchases $248 million of our common stock, or 6 million shares. Inventory increased 27% to $1.2 billion and inventory turns were flat at 12.7, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies, and introduced new product categories. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $86 million from a year ago to $543 million. Our 2007 capital expenditures were $224 million. I\u2019ll conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our Euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, inter-company balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don\u2019t record any additional intangibles, any further revisions to stock-based compensation, or our restructuring related estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they\u2019ve been recently. For Q1, we expect net sales of between $3.95 billion and $4.15 billion, a growth of between 31% and 38%. This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact of foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $155 million and $200 million, or between 7% growth and 38% growth. This includes approximately $55 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $210 million and $255 million, or between 17% growth and 42% growth. For calendar 2008, we expect net sales of between $18.75 billion and $19.75 billion, a growth of between 26% and 33%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $785 million and $985 million, or between 20% growth and 50% growth. This includes approximately $240 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $1.025 billion and $1.225 billion, or between 21% growth and 44% growth. We intend to continue to get operating leverage during 2008 with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability, including some changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $300 million. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. Thanks, and with that, Rob, let\u2019s move to questions.\nRob Eldridge: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions)  We\u2019ll go first to Brian Pitz with Banc of America.\nBrian Pitz: I think the question on everyone\u2019s mind is how should we begin to conceptualize the 20 basis points of margin expansion that\u2019s at the midpoint of your guidance for 2008, despite a really significant year-over-year revenue increase? It would seem as if you should be able to drive somewhat better margins, given this type of growth. What\u2019s driving this -- is it prime, higher overall cost of shipping? Any additional color would be really helpful. Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. We\u2019ve given a -- in terms of the guidance that we\u2019ve given for the total year, you have a range certainly in terms of implied operating margins. If you take the low end of the guidance from a CSOI perspective and the high end, it\u2019s a range of 5.5% to 6.2%, and that compares to 5.7% in 2007, so again it\u2019s a range. But certainly as you think about our business in 2008, you know, we are going to do more of the same that we did in 2007. We are going to make sure that we focus on the customer experience, which includes making sure that we have great prices across all of our categories and geographies, and you saw that reflected in our Q4 results. We are going to continue to make sure that we have increased selection, have great in-stock levels, so all of those things are included in the guidance that we\u2019ve given. And we are going obviously still continue to invest appropriately, which is reflected in the guidance. The other aspect that you see, because you see an effect that\u2019s essentially flat operating margins in Q4 and certainly one of the bigger drivers of that is the gross margin year-over-year decline. And with the great growth rate that we saw in Q4, when that happens, good things happen to us and what I mean by that, there\u2019s an opportunity to go to and work with our supplier base, our vendors, to get even better prices. So that\u2019s something that is certainly an opportunity for us and with the broad breadth of growth that we had across categories in all of our geographies, it\u2019s clearly an opportunity for us.\nBrian Pitz: Great, thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Heath Terry with Credit Suisse.\nHeath Terry: Thank you. Just to follow-up on what Brian was asking, how does this affect and to what extent does it affect the long-term margin guidance that you\u2019ve given of being able to get to 10% margins in the business? And as you continue to take the incremental profit dollar that you are getting and file them into top line to drive growth, at what point do you allow some of that margin, or how do you think about timing, the allowance of some of that margin to actually flow to the bottom line? Or is this going to be an ongoing process and we see 6% forever?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of our expectation, nothing has changed. What we\u2019ve said in the past is we think that double-digit operating margins are possible but what we are really focused on is driving free cash flow and free cash flow per share, as you can see that evidence in our 2007 results, total year as well as Q4. And so again, nothing has changed. We\u2019ve also said that we think double-digits is possible but if a high-single-digit operating margin is the right thing to drive free cash flow, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. So if you look at our Q4 results, and take a look at it, you saw very strong growth, you saw operating margins that were flat year over year but still strong operating profit growth, and then free cash flow was more than doubled year over year. So again, we\u2019re focused on driving free cash flow per share. It\u2019s certainly our intention to improve operating leverage during 2008 and over time, we think that we can improve our operating margins as well.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus.\nScott Devitt: Thank you. Just on this same subject, but a little bit more detailed -- the international gross margin in the quarter on a year-over-year basis was actually up, and so the decline was in the domestic margins, so there were a lot of moving parts in your gross margin numbers related to these volume price trade-offs that you talk about but also the product mix in the direct business and then the benefit from third-party sales. So I was just wondering if you could talk about whether third-party mix is becoming a less relevant driver of gross margin in the domestic business and so possibly pricing decisions and the mix shift toward EGM and the direct business is maybe what\u2019s pressuring the domestic gross margin? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Our seller business globally is very strong. We are continuing to try to work on that experience for sellers to make it even better. Certainly our goal is to have sellers increase their sales on our platform and so we continue to do a number of different things to make it easier for them to sell, including FBA. And so again, we are pleased with our seller business and -- I don\u2019t know if that answers your question. Did you have a -- was there a second part?\nScott Devitt: The second part is I\u2019m just wondering how much the mix shift towards EGM, which I believe is lower margin than the historical BMV direct business, if that\u2019s driving the domestic margins down a bit, the mix shift.\nThomas J. Szkutak: I would probably describe the margin structure more like this -- we have, and this is globally, we\u2019ve entered into a lot of new categories over the past few years and when we enter those new categories, we\u2019re pricing very competitively day one, making sure we upgrade prices for customers. And it takes us a while to get the scale in those individual categories in those geographies, so when that happens, certainly you should expect that very often times when we have a newer category, that those are lower gross margins and then, as we get the scale and those individual categories, good things happen. We get more traffic, which helps our third party business. It also helps us get better prices with our suppliers. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we are excited about what we have seen throughout the course of 2007 and in Q4, is that we\u2019ve gotten great growth and now the opportunity that we have in front of us is how do we work better with, even more closely with suppliers to get better prices. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s not an immediate thing. It\u2019s just something that evolves over time as we continue to grow, so it\u2019s a good opportunity for us.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citigroup.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you. Two questions -- first, a top line question; are you seeing any signs of consumer softness in spending? You organically showed revenue growth acceleration. It seemed to fly in the face of what most in-store retailers are seeing, obviously there\u2019s secular growth on the Internet but are you seeing anything perhaps in the March quarter that indicates softness, or maybe a mix shift to lower priced products? And then secondly, a quick question for you, Jeff; last quarter you said that you didn\u2019t think R&D cycles going forward would have the same step function impact on margins that they had between \u201904 and \u201906. Is any of the \u201908 guidance, is there an implication in there that there\u2019s another major R&D cycle coming? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the economic piece, as you can see from our results, our business is fine, so we really can\u2019t add much in terms of the economic piece.\nJeffrey P. Bezos: And then to your second question, I think what you are referring to is that we\u2019ve said over the last year or so that we expect to grow into the fixed expense that we very deliberately built in 2005 and the first part of 2006. And our intention at this point is to continue to demonstrate to ourselves this business model. So as Tom said, we intend to continue to get operating leverage during 2008 with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis.\nThomas J. Szkutak: And along with that, as it relates to technology and content, we certainly would expect the technology and content growth to be somewhat less than revenue growth for 2008.\nJeffrey P. Bezos: And we believe we can do that, with respect to the step function part of your question, we believe we can do that while continuing to make investments in our digital businesses and Amazon Kindle, and new category expansion, continue to invest in China as we are doing, fulfillment by Amazon in our seller business. We have our Amazon web services business is another area of investment for us. So when we look at -- that\u2019s what we mean by not necessarily having to take the same kind of step function increase that you saw in 2005 and the first part of 2006.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from David Joseph with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Joseph: Thank you for taking my question. It seems that you saw active customers accelerate again and active revenue per customer accelerate as well as units accelerate yet again 33% year over year, and our guess, our ongoing assumption is that a lot of this is coming through Amazon Prime, not only because that\u2019s where you have free shipping but that\u2019s also where one-click shopping is merchandised pretty effectively. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color in terms of where this incremental growth is coming from, where the acquisition, where the activity is coming from. Is it really coming through Amazon Prime mainly or is there something else that we might be missing here? Also, in terms of the Kindle, can you give us an idea of what we can be expecting from that in 2008? Not necessarily -- I mean, if you can provide any kind of information in terms of units or revenue growth but also what can we expect in terms of the margin? Should we expect some pressure to Amazon\u2019s margins from the Kindle? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: The growth that we are seeing is broad-based. It\u2019s coming from different geographies, different categories, different service offerings. So it\u2019s not any one particular thing. Certainly Amazon Prime is a component of it. It continues to be a successful program. One of the reasons that fulfillment by Amazon is an important program for our seller customers is that it drives -- the number one thing that sellers want is sales and fulfillment by Amazon drives sales for sellers, so when a seller switches to fulfillment by Amazon, their sales increase. And one of the reasons for that is that those items, those third-party items immediately become eligible for Amazon Prime, so Prime members can use their Amazon Prime memberships to buy third-party items as soon as that seller joins fulfillment by Amazon. And we shipped half a million items in the fourth quarter on behalf of third-party sellers through fulfillment by Amazon, so we are very excited about that investment.\nDavid Joseph: Can you give us a little color on the Kindle?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: Yeah, Kindle is, in terms of demand, is outpacing our expectations, which is certainly something that we are very grateful for. It\u2019s also on the manufacturing side causing us to scramble. We\u2019re working very hard to increase the number of units that we can build and supply per week, so that we can get back -- our goal is to get into a situation as quickly as we can where when you order a Kindle, we ship it immediately. That\u2019s the standard we want to hold ourselves to and we are working very hard to get there. We are super-excited by the very strong demand.\nDavid Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: Great. A couple of questions, guys; user and unit growth accelerated again. Can you just talk about how much of this improvement is being driven by I guess price elasticity that\u2019s utilizing on your retail business versus newer services such as third party out there, or initiatives such as Prime? And the second question on Kindle, it looks like there is a lot of internal components from a build standpoint. It seems to be quite rich from a feature set standpoint. Are there capabilities that have yet to be turned on beyond just the e-book reader and browser functionality inside the Kindle at this point?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: Well, the Kindle has a few experimental features that are -- some of which are visible on the Kindle. It has something call a Now-Now, where you can type in any question and using the Mechanical Turk in the background, which is one of our web services, that question gets answered and the answer to the question gets displayed on the Kindle. There is an experimental web browser on the Kindle, which is actually, for a mobile device, a pretty good web browser, and of course is has the Whisper Net EVDO connectivity, which gives you broadband wireless access to that web browser. So there are a number of experimental features and we\u2019ve put those on there and made them accessible to customers so that these early Kindle users can tell us what they think of those features, whether we should continue to invest in them, continue to work on them and make them part of the product.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the first part of your question related to the growth in units, as I had mentioned, the third party or the seller percentage grew year over year, so seller units were growing at a faster rate. And that goes back to some of the comments Jeff just made a minute ago about what we are doing to improve the seller experience. And then on the retail side, it\u2019s a lot of the things that we\u2019ve been talking about. It\u2019s -- again, the focus areas are value proposition, making sure we have great prices for customers, selection, convenience, and in-stock levels.\nJeetil Patel: Do you think it\u2019s actually the retail business and your pricing that\u2019s helping to accelerate the unit growth and user growth? Or do you think it is more on the third party selection side?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Well again, both are very strong and certainly pricing is a key, but there\u2019s a lot of other key factors, including Prime, where customers are getting an increased share of wallet, and a number of different factors. The fact that some customers come to our website now, more is in stock than it was 12 months ago or 24 months ago. So when that happens, certainly there\u2019s a benefit from doing that, as well as a lot of the other things that we talked about. So it\u2019s selection --\nJeffrey P. Bezos: It\u2019s selection expansion.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Selection expansion, exactly. So it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s a lot of the things that we\u2019ve been talking about really over the past several years but we have continued to be focused on them and it\u2019s showing up in our top line.\nJeetil Patel: If I may ask just a quick follow-up, I guess the longer term theme at Amazon has been that you would use price as a way to drive growth in the business and the idea was that you could always lower price because of the cost advantages that you have and the efficiencies that  you are getting from economies of scale. Are you at a point now vis-\u00e0-vis retail that you can drive prices lower and it\u2019s helping to accelerate the growth and you can always use that lever to control the growth of your overall business as a whole? Or do you think it\u2019s still going to take maybe a couple more years to have that type of capability relative to I guess the retail formula, which is prices will tend to go higher in general because of the inflationary aspect of retail and real estate?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: I\u2019m not sure if this directly answers your question or not -- I think it does but one of the things that\u2019s clearly the case and we\u2019ve observed it over a number of years now is that in certain categories, we are seeing less elasticity from price reductions and that\u2019s something that you would expect to see happen because there\u2019s -- price elasticity curves are not linear. There\u2019s a kind of an elbow in the curve right around where competitive prices are, so you see a lot of elasticity as you lower prices to meet competitive pricing and you don\u2019t see very much elasticity if you go below competitive pricing. So our focus has always been to be extremely competitive and to get really operationally great at that, so that our pricing is very, very sharp and we are always giving customers the best possible deal. And at the same time, because we have the scale to have a very efficient cost structure, to be able to do that in a sustainable way that\u2019s healthy for the business. And you can have a very nice fly wheel there where the scale of the company increases, which allows us to be more efficient, to make better use of both our fixed costs and to do more to drive down variable costs, including as Tom mentioned in some of our newer categories where we haven\u2019t been operating as long, we\u2019re still getting to know the vendors in those categories, getting to know our suppliers, figuring out how to work most efficiently with them and we\u2019ll continue to do that. So there are big opportunities and for us, the way we look at this is lowering prices is easy -- being able to afford to lower prices is what\u2019s difficult and we\u2019ve been working on that for many, many years now and we expect to continue to work on it for our entire corporate existence. And we know of lots of opportunities to improve our fixed costs, to improve our variable costs, and to improve our COGS through working together with our supplier base. And those opportunities exist in even our -- even the categories that we\u2019ve been doing business in the longest. We still have opportunities in there. In our newer categories, we have a lot of low-hanging fruit. There\u2019s more obvious pieces just because they are newer and we haven\u2019t done as much in those areas.\nJeetil Patel: Crystal clear. Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Robert Peck with Bear Stearns.\nRobert Peck: Just a quick question, two parts, on guidance going forward -- eBay made some announcements the other day regarding changes to its platform, which is hoping to sort of bring back some of the third party sellers. Is your current guidance right now accounting for any sort of impact by eBay or do you think there will be any impact by eBay? And then I\u2019ve got one follow-up.\nThomas J. Szkutak: We have a longstanding practice of not talking about any specific company but as it relates to our business, we have been and continue to be in a very competitive environment. And that\u2019s both online and offline, and that\u2019s not anything new. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been operating in for quite some time and the way we address that is we focus on the customer, and we have a number of different customers. We have certainly our direct customer that we are always trying to make sure we improve that experience. We have our sellers, which we view as partners and customers and we\u2019re trying to improve that experience as well, and Jeff gave some great examples of that, as well as our developers. And so we are kind of heads down, focused on improving customer experience and that\u2019s what we have been doing and that\u2019s what we plan on doing going forward?\nRobert Peck: If you started to see an impact, would you think about reducing your take rate for third-party sellers?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I would just say that this is such an intensely competitive environment and it has been from the very beginning, and we have lots of competitors. So it\u2019s -- for us, the way we think about our seller business, the business you are asking about, is we think of our sellers as a customer set. We try to figure out what they want and we try to figure out how to give it to them. We know that the number one thing that sellers want is sales. We also know that these -- the market that we operate in, and we are very grateful for this fact, is a very, very large one and in our view, and we\u2019ve always said this, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change, is that there\u2019s room for lots of winners. We have a strategy that we are very, very focused on. We\u2019re not changing it. We like our strategy and we are just going to stay heads down. One of the great examples I can give you for trying to drive sales for sellers is the combination of fulfillment by Amazon and Amazon Prime. I talked about this just a couple of minutes ago but it\u2019s a very good combination for sellers and as sellers continue to sign up for fulfillment by Amazon and as our buyer customers continue to sign up for Amazon Prime, that combination is going to be very good for our buyer customers and it\u2019s going to be very good for our seller customers as well, and we love that.\nRobert Peck: Just a quick follow-up on guidance here. Could you talk a little bit about your Borders relationship and if your guidance in 2008 accounts for any change there?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. The relationship that we have is reflected in the guidance for 2008.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Imran Khan with J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan: Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions, number one; I was trying to get a better sense about what kind of adoption you are seeing for prime in the international market -- is it similar to U.S., better than U.S. or weaker than U.S.? Any color would be very helpful. Secondly, international gross profit margin is still substantially lower than the U.S. gross profit margins. How should we think about that difference to narrow over time?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of international prime, you know, it\u2019s -- we are very excited with what we are seeing in each of the countries. It\u2019s very early but we like what we see and we are going to continue to look at all the associated metrics for that program, but we are very pleased to be able to offer it to customers and we like what we see so far. In terms of the gross margins, you are right that our gross margins in international are less than North America. Keep in mind that certainly our international segment has a number of different countries and again, there\u2019s nothing really structurally different between the two segments, if you will, and so there\u2019s really opportunities to improve those margins over time. What we have said in the past is certainly our seller business, if you will, we are pleased with globally but we have certainly a bigger penetration in our North America segment than we do in international, so that\u2019s an opportunity for us. It\u2019s an opportunity in both segments, if you will, but certainly we\u2019re pleased with what we see there. Again, if you think about also in international, if you look back we\u2019ve launched many new categories over the past year, the past few years and again it goes back to some of my comments at the start of the call. As those categories get larger and we get more traffic to those categories, it helps the third party business. It also helps from an opportunity to work closely with suppliers to get better, to work better with them to improve those prices as well. So again, that\u2019s the -- that\u2019s certainly what we are working on and that\u2019s what you are seeing in our results.\nImran Khan: If I may ask a follow-up question about the category expansion, I think you talked about, as you continue to grow faster than the broader market, you will have better power with the seller suppliers in terms of improving your gross profit margins. As you continue to expand your category and some of the categories are lower margins than your core media business, do you think you can still maintain the kind of margins that you had in 2007 or 2006?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: We have a wide range of categories. When we enter a new category, we\u2019re focused on first, is it something that we think we can serve customers well in, something that we can add a lot of value to customers, and also do we think we can generate a lot of free cash flow. We certainly do look at a lot of different characteristics of those categories before entering them, but there certainly are categories, an example would be you know, the diamonds within the jewelry category. That\u2019s something where you know it\u2019s possible to have lower gross margins but have very high contribution profit per unit, for example. So first we are optimizing for, from an investor standpoint, for free cash flow and free cash flow per share, and the way we do that is by improving the customer experience. So again, it\u2019s a -- we\u2019ve have a mix of different categories, some of which will have higher gross margins and lower gross margins, but our goal is again to maximize free cash flow per share over the long term.\nImran Khan: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jennifer Watson with Goldman Sachs.\nJennifer Watson: Thank you. Can you give us some details on the order frequency of Prime users since the introduction of the service, and if incremental prime members are ordering as frequently as the early adopters?\nThomas J. Szkutak: There\u2019s not a lot of data I can share with you except that certainly Prime customers are buying more and we are getting an increased share of wallet. They are buying in more categories, so there\u2019s a lot of cross shopping that is going on and that\u2019s something that we saw early on when we started Prime and it\u2019s something we continue to see with existing and new customers.\nJennifer Watson: Great, and can you give any sort of indication on renewal rates of prime memberships?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Other than it\u2019s very good. We\u2019re not disclosing numbers but the renewal rates are very good, very strong.\nJennifer Watson: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with Lehman Brothers.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you. I have two questions. First, can you tell us what is driving your projected 34% increase in CapEx spending in 2008 and how should we think about your free cash flow growth specifically this year? And then secondly, it looks like you added 1,200 employees during the fourth quarter. What\u2019s the delta there versus the 600 that you added in 4Q06 in terms of the composition of employees? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the -- I\u2019ll take the employee one first. You know, we did increase our employee base. The largest portion of that was certainly in our operations and fulfillment area, with the growth that we experienced throughout 2007, as well as what you were seeing in Q4. We certainly improved, increased our staffing level to support that. In terms of CapEx, I think you should probably take a look at it versus the incremental revenue that you are seeing and again, it\u2019s in support of our overall business as we grow, so that\u2019s what we are looking at.\nDoug Anmuth: Any commentary on what you could grow free cash flow in \u201908?\nThomas J. Szkutak: We have traditionally not given guidance on free cash flow but again, over time, we certainly see that operating profit as well as some adjustments for working capital tracks pretty nicely. But again, we\u2019re not giving specific guidance for 2008 free cash flow.\nDoug Anmuth: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: A couple of questions about your outlook, which I think most people are wondering about. First, it looks like revenue is higher than a lot of people were thinking, but maybe margins lower. Do you anticipate any changes in the mix between third party units and your own units? And then secondly, does your outlook give you room to accelerate either new category launches internationally next year, or new countries or fulfillment centers? What kind of flexibility have you built in there?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the guidance that we have for 2008 reflects our best view of what\u2019s going to happen in 2008 and as we talked about earlier, we are still investing, going to continue to invest in the business, as Jeff highlighted a number of key areas. But as part of that, we expect it to be appropriate growth in terms of technology and content. And in terms of some of the other things that you mentioned, you should expect that we\u2019re going to expand capacity as we have over the past few years to fulfill the demand for the range of guidance that we\u2019ve given. You should also expect us to launch new categories as well during 2008. So those are things that we are going to continue to focus on. In addition to launching new categories, you should expect us to increase selection on our existing categories in each of our geographies. So those are things that we\u2019ll continue to work on to make that experience better for customers.\nJustin Post: And how about that first part, third part ratio? Do you expect that to change much next year?\nThomas J. Szkutak: We\u2019re not giving guidance on what the mix will look like and ultimately, and this is both from 2008 and really any year,  we view that nothing has changed and we\u2019ve said this consistently. Ultimately the customer will decide where the mix ends up and that\u2019s both in the current year and long-term. What we are focused on is making sure that the experience is great for our various customer sets and we do that. We think we have nice opportunities to grow both our seller business as well as our retail business, along with our other customer set as well.\nJustin Post: Last question -- the other U.S. revenues were up $30 million year over year. It looks like some nice growth there -- is that a positive lever for margin, gross margins? And what\u2019s really driving that growth?\nThomas J. Szkutak: We haven\u2019t split up the margins of other but certainly we\u2019ve got a number of things going into other that are Amazon Enterprise Solutions business, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. We\u2019ve launched a number of new merchants, which is certainly helpful. Web services as well, so again, it\u2019s a number of different components of that. We also have various marketing arrangements. Sometimes it\u2019s higher or lower, depending upon the period. So again, there\u2019s a number of different things that are going into that line item.\nJustin Post: Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question today will come from Aaron Kessler with Piper Jaffray.\nAaron Kessler: A couple of questions; first, the marketing costs were up slightly on a year-over-year basis as a percent of revenues. I just want to see if there is anything specific to that, and then one follow-up question.\nThomas J. Szkutak: The marketing has been, over the past several years, actually in a pretty tight band as a percentage of revenue and it continues to try to make sure that we make that spend more efficient, so there is nothing -- I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unusual with it.\nAaron Kessler: Great, and then in terms of -- maybe a question for Jeff; in terms of your expectation for the digital media business, obviously a lot of traditional media in terms of books, music, movies is going more toward a download basis and you are clearly getting prepared for that day when you see more of that shift happening. Any sense for when you really start to see more of that shift happen and what you think the impact will be on your business? I guess how much can you offset the lower traditional media sales with your increased digital sales would be the question?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: Long term, we are very optimistic about that because when media are physical products, it makes a lot of sense for a large majority of those sales to happen in the physical world. But as media becomes digital and downloaded and sent around wirelessly, et cetera, et cetera, it doesn\u2019t make so much sense to buy those in the physical world. And so our relative advantage relative to where the bulk of the sales are today, the bulk of the sales today are of course in the physical world, so our relative advantage over time should improve relative to the physical world. So we\u2019re very -- in sort of the long term, very excited about it.\nAaron Kessler: Great. Thank you.\nRob Eldridge: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-10-24 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com third quarter2007 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions)  For opening remarks, I will be turning thecall over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Kim Nelson. Please goahead.\nKim Nelson: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2007 financial resultsconference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, ourfounder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questionsreflect management's views as of today October 23, 2007 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actualresults may differ materially. Additional information about factors that couldpotentially impact our financial results is included in today's press releaseand our filings with the SEC, including our 2006 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have ourpress release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well asmetrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financialmeasures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and ourfilings with the SEC -- each of which is posted on our IR website -- you willfind additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, includingreconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on thiscall will be against our results for the comparable period of 2006. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Kim. I'll begin with comments on our financialresults. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 118% to $800 million, whilethe combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding wasunchanged from a year ago at $435 million. Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $3.26billion, or 38% excluding the $75 million favorable impact from foreignexchange. Q3 2007 revenue benefited by approximately 290 basis points ofyear-over-year growth from Harry Potter VII sales, plus attachments. Media revenue increased to $2.09 billion, up 36%, or 32%excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $1.08 billion, up 54% or 51% excludingFX. EGM accounted for 33% of worldwide sales in Q3 2007, up from 30% for thesame period last year. Our worldwide unit growth was 32%, and active customeraccounts exceeded 72 million, up 17% year over year. Worldwide gross profit was $762 million, up 39%. Grossmargin decreased 45 basis points to 23.4%, primarily due to lowering prices andchange in product mix partially offset by increases in our third-partybusiness. Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.2 million, and third partyunits were 32% of total units versus 30% in the prior year. Amazon Prime memberships more than doubled year over year. Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-basedcompensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was$585 million, or 18% of sales, an improvement of 273 basis points year overyear. Fulfillment was $285 million or 8.7% of net sales, down 31 basis pointsyear over year. During the quarter, we opened new fulfillment centers in Phoenix, Arizona and Saran, France. Technology and content was $181 million, or 5.6% of netsales, an improvement of 122 basis points year over year, as we continue togrow into our new level of spending. Marketing was $72 million or 2.2% of netsales, an improvement of 51 basis points year over year. In recent years, ourmarketing spend has been between 2.2% to 2.7% of net sales. Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent withprior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation orother operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenuegrew 42% to $1.79 billion. This is the highest growth rate in seven years.Media revenue grew 38% to $1.08 billion. EGM revenue grew 54% to $631 million,representing 35% of North American revenues, up from 33%. We saw anotherquarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and baby, and soft goods whichincludes jewelry, apparel, shoes and sporting goods. North American gross profitgrew 34% to $460 million, and gross margin decreased 159 basis points to 25.7%,primarily due to lower prices and changes in product mix. North Americansegment operating income increased 263% to $79 million, a 4.4% operatingmargin. In the international segment, revenue was $1.47 billion, up40% or 33% adjusted for the $72 million favorable foreign exchange impact. Mediarevenue grew 33% to $1.01 billion or 27% excluding FX. EGM revenue grew 54% to$448 million or 45% excluding foreign exchange. International gross profit grew47% to $302 million, or 39% excluding FX, while gross margin increased 88 basispoints to 20.5%, reflecting the increase in third party mix, partially offsetby lower prices and changes in product mix. International segment operatingincome increased 94% to $98 million or 6.6% operating margin. Excluding the $5million favorable impact from FX, international operating income increased 81%. CSOI grew 145% to $177 million or 5.4% of net sales, up 228basis points year over year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includesstock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operatingincome grew 207% to $123 million or 3.8% of net sales. Our provision for income taxes was $44 million in Q3 or a35% rate for the quarter, which includes an $8 million year-to-date adjustmentto reflect our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate of 29%, whichincorporates our strong North America growth. As a reminder, there is potential for significant volatilityof our effective tax rate due to several factors, including variability inaccurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction. In2007, we anticipate cash paid for income taxes will be approximately $25million, compared to $15 million in 2006, as we continue to benefit from NOLsinside the United States.NOL utilization is impacted by many factors, including our excess stock-basedcompensation deductions. GAAP net income was $80 million or $0.19 per diluted share,compared with $19 million and $0.05 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securitieswere $1.91 billion, an increase of $690 million year over year. Inventoryincreased 32% to $970 million, and inventory turns decreased from 13.2 a year ago to 12.4 as we expandedselection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographiesand introduced new product categories. Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes netcapitalized software development costs, increased $42 million from a year agoto $491 million. Our return on invested capital was 42%. ROIC is TTM-free cashflow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance.Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-dateand what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange ratefluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's notpossible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results coulddiffer materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issuessuch as marking our euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, intra-companybalances in foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries,unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax ratecan all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangibleassets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or ourrestructuring-related estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately wherethey have been recently. For Q4 we expect net sales of between $5.1 billion and $5.45billion, or growth of between 28% and 37%. This guidance anticipates greaterthan 300 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $221 million and $291million, or grow between 12% and 48%. This includes $54 million primarily forstock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, whichexcludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between$275 million and $345 million, or grow between 20% and 51%. For calendar year 2007 we expect net sales of between$14.263 billion and $14.613 billion, or growth of between 33% and 36%. Thisguidance anticipates greater than 300 basis points of positive impact from foreignexchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $605 million and $675million, or growth of between 56% and 74%. This includes $191 million primarilyfor stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, whichexcludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between$796 million and $866 million, or grow between 59% and 73%. We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trendsimilar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with somevariability from changes to working capital. We expect capital expenditures,including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250million. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growthof free cash flow and free cash flow per share, while investing in ourlong-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improvecustomer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well asour free cash flow, will expand. Thanks. With that, let's move to questions.\nKim Nelson: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion ofthe call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners howto initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes fromJeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: Looking at the -- call it almost 11 million -- new activecustomers you've had in the past year, can you discuss their purchase frequencyor if they are buying from you just as voraciously as the previous set ofactive customers? What's driving the accelerated growth across the board? Second, can you talk about the broader impact of lowerconsumer spending you're seeing in your business? Are you seeing any effect, ordo you think that perhaps the online side is a little bit more immune to it,given that it seems to be more about pricing as a big driver of why folks buyonline, in addition to convenience and other factors?\nTom Szkutak: Jeetil, I'll take the second half of the question first. Interms of the impact of consumer spending, I think what you're seeing for us,and we're certainly not a bellwether for the economy, but what you're seeing iscustomers reacting and responding to just a very good customer experience:continued focus on lower prices, increased selection and certainly, speed ofdelivery with Prime being a factor. We think that plays well, as reflected inour guidance for Q4 as we enter into the holiday season. The customer is reallygoing to get a great customer experience again in Q4, as they did in Q3. The first part of your question, we haven't broken out anyparticular details on active customers beyond what we mentioned earlier in thecomments. So I really can't help you much with that one.\nJeetil Patel: Do you think it's more driven by selection that you'reseeing the accelerated growth, or do you think it's actually more just thecustomer/consumer reaction? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Again, as Imentioned, it's a combination of increased selection. We've increased selectionin the categories we're in, going much deeper. We've added new categories overtime, as you've seen. We continue to get even sharper on pricing, and those arethings that we have a constant focus on. We also want to make sure thatinventory is there, so that we can get it to customers very fast, which you cansee reflected in our turns. So all of those things we spend a lot of time on,and that certainly impacts the customer experience. That is reflected in thegrowth rates that you've seen in Q3.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs.\nAnthony Noto: Tom, after an extended period of investment, you have nowgone to a period of obviously being able to grow into your expenses and drivevery high incremental margins. I was wondering as you look into 2008, would youcharacterize that as another year of growing into your expenses and drivingcontinued margin expansion? Or is it a year in which you may have more balancedinvestment versus improved profitability? I have a follow-up question for Jeff on the consumer as itrelates to online behavior. Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Unfortunately, we're not giving guidance on 2008 today.Consistent with what we've done over the last couple of years, we'll be givingguidance on our next call after our Q4 earnings. But as it relates totechnology and content spending, roughly 15 or 18 months ago, we certainlytalked about the fact that we had spent the previous two to two-and-a-halfyears increasing our investment in a number of key areas. We said in the secondhalf of last year that would start to slow down. You saw that most prominentlyin Q4 of last year, and that continued in the first three quarters of thisyear, as we have grown into this level of investment. I think certainly thatyou've seen that to date. I think one of the things you should keep in mind which is alittle different than where we were back in 2004 when we started this increasein investment, is our base is bigger. We can afford to invest with this higherbase that we have, more so than we did in 2004. So again, we will be sharingguidance for 2008 on our next call, but hopefully that helps.\nJeff Bezos: I'll just add to that by saying that the bigger base mightallow us to make investments over time, with less of a step function changethan you've seen in the past.\nAnthony Noto: I was also wonderingif you could comment, if you think about Amazon's value proposition for theconsumer today versus maybe three years ago, that value proposition has alwaysoffered increased selection, better prices and greater convenience. What do you think has changed at Amazon vis-\u00e0-vis the \u201con land\u201dexperience that has resulted in a meaningful widening of that gap?\nJeff Bezos: I think it is really just the continuation of those thingsthat you mentioned. Year in and year out, we have been adding categories andadding very significant selection and depth inside categories. It sometimessurprises people to learn that we continue to do that, even in the categorieswe have been involved in the longest, such as books. But we do continue todeepen our categories there. We've gotten better at managing inventory, so we're moreoften in-stock, which allows us to deliver products to customers much faster.We've also just incrementally over time gotten more efficient, better at defectreduction so we can do things accurately for customers at low cost. That hasallowed us to continuously lower prices. I think it's the combination of those things: gettingproducts to customers quickly, having the broad selection and the deepselection, and having very attractive price points in combination with freeshipping. That package of things, we have been very, very consistent on for along time. I don't think there any changes there. I just think that every year,we get a little bit better.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Joseph - Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Joseph: I have one questionrelated to gross margin. It looks like it came down by about 44 basis pointsyear over year, and we did notice that your shipping loss was up nearly about40%, but it looks like your third party sellers were actually accelerated.  I'm wondering if there was a one-time impactthere from Harry Potter. Maybe you can also talk a little bit about thecontribution from third party sales. As an additional comment on that, our question would befulfillment and G&A. G&A actually declined on an absolute basis; fulfillmentdeclined on a percentage basis of revenue. Fulfillment might be scale, but canyou tell us a little bit about if  we'remissing anything on fulfillment, but also what might have lead to decline inG&A? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of gross margins, yes, Harry Potter is having aneffect. It was slightly less than a contribution profit breakeven event for us.You should assume that's a lower gross margin than our average, so it isbringing it down. In terms of our overall expense, as you look at our directsegment operating expenses, there are certainly a number of different impacts butkeep in mind, as I was mentioning a few questions ago, in the first threequarters of last year our direct segment operating expenses in total whichincludes tech and content, fulfillment, G&A and marketing, were growing ata rate that was faster than revenue, and Q3 is no exception to that. So we'regetting leverage on each of those line items.\nDavid Joseph: With the impact to gross margin on Harry Potter, should weexpect that to normalize over the next couple of quarters?\nTom Szkutak: Again, we're not giving guidance on those individual lineitems, but certainly what we expect is reflected in our Q4 guidance, but it didhave an impact on our Q3 results.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Victor Anthony - Bear Stearns.\nVictor Anthony: I wonder if you could give us an update on yourinternational expansion plans beyond the six international locations that youhave right now? I am curious as to what geographies look attractive. And, anysort of timeframe? The second question is really on the internationalelectronics and other general merchandise category. It looks like there was asignificant acceleration in revenues on that line, and I was curious as to whatis driving that particular acceleration. The final question is really on your guidance for 4Q. Itlooks the pro forma operating margin at the midpoint is really calling for amodest improvement on a year-over-year basis, compared to the sizable jump inthis particular third quarter that you just reported. I'm wondering if there'sanything of note in that particular quarter in the guidance? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: As it relates to theinternational expansion, we certainly will add new geographies over time, butwe certainly think there's a lot of improvement in terms of additionalselection that we can add in the geographies that we're in. We really like thegeographies that we're in. In terms of categories today, we're most penetrated in the U.S.right now, and each of the individual geographies outside of the U.S.don't have the same depth that we do in our Amazon.com website. So that'sclearly a focus for us as we add new categories, selection within thoseexisting categories as well as new categories. You mentioned the EGM growth in international beingaccelerated this quarter. What's driving that is some of the things that we'vebeen talking about which is really just fundamentals. We have been addingselection. We continue to try to improve the customer experience, making surethat our prices are sharp in all of the geographies and categories that we'rein and continue to work on reducing those overall customer-facing defects. Sothose are the things that are really helping our international EGM growth. In terms of guidance, the implied guidance for CSOItranslates into a range of 5.4% on the low side to 6.3% on the high side foroperating margins, with the midpoint being at 5.9%, which is up from 5.7% lastyear. Two things to keep in mind. One is, as you look at last year's results,through the first three quarters the growth rate for those individual quarters,excluding foreign exchange, were anywhere from 23% to 25%. In Q4, it jumped to30% and we've had sizable growth since then. So again, we're overlapping that30% growth rate. The second piece is, as I was mentioning about our directsegment operating expenses growing at a faster rate for the first threequarters of last year, it was growing at a faster rate than revenue. In Q4, ourdirect segment operating expenses were actually growing at a slower rate thanrevenue and we are overlapping that as well. So those two factors, must certainlybe taken into account as we look at our guidance for Q4.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citi.\nMark Mahaney: I wanted to ask aboutthe progress or status of some of the digital media offerings. It looks likeUnbox is coming up through a couple of iterations, nice healthy improvement inthe product and in the user interface. You've had the music service out. Canyou quantify at all or give any qualitative comments about what kind oftraction you're seeing for those segments? Maybe just to stress out the negative, are you seeing anysigns that is cannibalizing existing sales of CDs or of DVDs? Thanks a lot.\nJeff Bezos: I would just say that we're very happy with the earlyresults that we're seeing. We're getting terrific feedback from customers.Everybody loves the DRM free format, so selling MP3s is very successful for us.We have a lot of initiatives that we continue to work on. One of the thingswith our MP3 store is the way we look at it, the onus is on us to continue toconvince music labels that this is a good way to sell their music. So wecontinue to work on that, but we're very happy with the way that it's going. Our approach on this is you get out there and you getstarted, and you try to figure out what customers want and try to figure outhow to give it to them, and then just repeat that consistently over a number ofyears. So you can count on us to keep working on those things. We're thrilledwith the early results from customers.\nMark Mahaney: No evidence that it'shad any impact on the physical CD or DVDs sales?\nJeff Bezos: We haven't seen anyevidence of that. I think it's way too early to know whether you would see anyof that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Pitz - Bank of America.\nBrian Pitz: First, any commentaryon the performance or traction of some of your newer, higher-margin categoriessuch as handbags, shoes or even auto parts? Then maybe some thoughts on newareas for expansion? A follow-on to the digital media question, you're offeringthis digital locker to store digital books and video downloads. Is it possiblefor you to add essentially similar features for music downloads as well, downthe road? Thanks.\nJeff Bezos: Well, with respect toyour last question first, that's exactly the kind of thing that we try tosolicit feedback on from customers and see if it would be helpful and if it is,then work together with our industry partners to try and figure out how to makethat happen. As far as some of the new categories go, we like the resultswe see. When we launch a new category, we always go through a period where wehave to have significant inventory upfront relative to the early sales, sothat's one of the factors that contributes in our corporate-wide inventoryturns. But those are very good investments and what we see is over time, we getvery good at managing these new categories. What we're initially trying to do when we launch a newcategory is make sure that the customer experience is good, even from thebeginning. So we forward-invest in the customer experience in a new category tomake sure that it's going to be acceptable to customers. We try to get betterat it, and then we hone the economics in those new categories over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Devitt - StifelNicolaus.\nScott Devitt: The question relates to Merchants@ internationally. Ibelieve the marketplace has been open in the international market for a fewyears now, so I'm trying to get a better understanding of how significantMerchants@ can be internationally, over time. I was wondering if you could just talk about the mixdomestically between Amazon Marketplace for third party units and Merchants@,just to better understand the dynamics? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: If you take a look at our international third party business,as I mentioned in the opening remarks, our total worldwide third party units asa percentage of total units is 32%. We haven't broken out the details betweenNorth America and international, but certainly the North America is morepenetrated than international is. But we see nice progress in international interms of improving as a percentage of third party units. So we are very pleasedwith how that part of the business is going, and that's certainly one of thedrivers that you see reflected in our gross margins on international. In terms of how big it can be, it's a difficult question toanswer. What we do is two things. We're very focused on trying to improve ouroverall customer experience, which includes third parties. We're focused onimproving the retail side of our business, meaning product that we selldirectly, and so we are continuously trying to add selection, add newcategories, improve in-stocks, as Jeff mentioned, to drive the retail business. Then we're also focused on how do we improve the sellerexperience, so it makes it easier for sellers to sell? So ultimately where that will end up in terms of balancewill be up to the customer to decide on what that ultimate mix will be. But ourgoal is certainly to improve the experience, keep on improving the experiencefor both sellers and customers. We think with that, the customers can decidewhere that ends up.\nJeff Bezos: One category to highlight, perhaps -- especially as we gointo the holiday season here -- is the toy category. This is going to be, byfar, our best customer experience in the toy category in the company's history.And it is not only Amazon retail toys, but there is also now a very strongnetwork of third party toy sellers in the toy category. The combination ofthose is providing an outstanding customer experience. That will be part of ourrecord holiday, and we're really excited about it.\nScott Devitt: Thank you very much. Are you able to give any informationdomestically related to Amazon Marketplace versus Merchants@ which maybe couldgive better color as to the international dynamics?\nTom Szkutak: I apologize. We really can't help you with that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: I have a couple ofinterrelated questions to gross margin. I've got your third party units upnorth of 40%. It really looks like you are taking share there. Can you quantifyat all the impact on gross margins? Do you expect that to really help nextyear? Then if you look at the U.S.,if you back out the Harry Potter revenues, everybody is going to have their ownassumptions, but it looks like gross margins were still down in the U.S.,ex-that. Is that just because of the new categories, or was that more pricing-related?Could you really get into what drove that, and is that part of your 4Qguidance?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the North America piece, certainly Harry Potter is having a negative impacton gross margins. Also, mix of business is impacting gross margins as well. Interms of the other part of your question, the first part, can you just repeatthat again?\nJustin Post: We have your third party units outstripping your regularunit growth; we have it at over 40%. What kind of impact is that having ongross margins, and do you think that could be a positive driver as we look outto next year?\nTom Szkutak: Well in terms of impact, certainly our third party businessin general helps our gross margins, and certainly other factors to think aboutwhen you look at our gross margins are we continue to lower prices forcustomers, we continue to try to make sure we get great prices from suppliersand also mix of business. Those are the key factors that are impacting grossmargins. In terms of 2008 again, we will be giving our guidance for 2008 afterthe Q4 call.\nJustin Post: Last question. As you look out to the holidays, any specificproducts that you're excited about or want to mention that we should be lookingfor on Amazon?\nJeff Bezos: There are probably a bunch, but the one that I wouldhighlight is Amazon Prime. I mean, especially during the holiday season, wehave been very successful signing up Amazon Prime members, but there are stilla lot of people out there that would benefit from being Amazon Prime members.The people who are members love it; that's certainly, for the holiday season, avery good product.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Imran Khan \u2013 JP Morgan.\nImran Khan: I understand that your gross profit margin in internationalis 20.5%. Obviously, third party is significantly lower in the internationalmarket. I am trying to get a better sense of how quickly you can narrow the gapbetween U.S.and international gross profit margins? Jeff, you talked about putting customers first to drive thegrowth and increase shareholder value. As your third party business becomes abigger and bigger part of your business and your third party sellers numbergrows, how do you ensure customer satisfaction? Thank you.\nJeff Bezos: I'll take that second one first. It's a very good question,and it's something we spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about andfocusing on. We've done a lot over time to maintain that customer experience.It starts with making sure that we have a good method of evaluating third-partysellers and making sure that they are sincere and want to do a great job forcustomers. We have a big team of people that do that. The other thing is we have started something calledFulfillment by Amazon, which is getting a lot of early traction, growingrapidly. It allows third-party sellers to effectively let us do the fulfillmentfor them so they can, using Fulfillment by Amazon, send products directly toour fulfillment centers and then we do the packing and shipping directly tocustomers. That has a lot of systemwide efficiencies in it for thethird party seller and for us, because for one thing, if a customer orders twoitems they may order an item from us and they might order an item from thethird party seller. If the third party seller is using Fulfillment by Amazon,then we can marry those two items together in a single box, which saves asignificant amount of money in transportation costs. We're able to pass some ofthat savings on to the third party sellers who use Fulfillment by Amazon. At the same time, from a customer experience point of view,if we are the ones fulfilling that third party unit, the customers get all ofthe benefits that they are accustomed to when they buy an Amazon retail unit.So for example, they get gift wrap, they get Free Super Saver Shipping. If theyare Amazon Prime members, they get two-day shipping for free on that third partyunit. So it basically levels the playing field for third party sellers andallows them to give the consumer all of the same benefits that Amazon retail isproviding. That's an example of the kind of program that we tried to put inplace. We're seeing very good reception from our seller community in taking usup on that offer.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the firstpart of your question, it's difficult to predict the answer to your question asit relates to gross margins. I can tell you how we think about it, though. Someof the inputs are as we enter new categories we're trying to make sure that wehave a great customer experience. We start with adding selection. We continue to work on theinput to customer experience, making it convenient for customers, making surethat the pricing is right. Over time, what happens is you'll get scale in thatparticular category. When you do that, good things happen. You have more thirdparties that are attracted to those detail pages to sell their products on. Wealso get better savings from vendors as we buy more from vendors. So as you think about those countries that we are in today,as we improve the scale of those by again, adding new selection, adding newcategories, those are the things that will help us with our core part of ourretail business as well as third parties and getting better savings fromvendors. So the combination are certainly the things that will helpus improve over time in international.\nImran Khan: Jeff, in terms of Amazon Prime, you have had that for awhile. Could you talk a little bit about the learnings you have had from AmazonPrime? How does that help you to improve your fulfillment and inventorymanagement efficiency? Do you think as we continue to have Amazon Prime andmore customer takes, you can actually have better selections and better stockavailability and can enhance your fulfillment? Thank you.\nJeff Bezos: Well, one of theopportunities over time is, what Amazon Prime does as it continues to grow isit increases our express shipping volume. We have more volume now being shippedtwo-day rather than standard because for $79 a year, Amazon Prime members getunlimited free two-day shipping with no hurdle. So you can right now our FreeSuper Saver Shipping offer is available to everyone, but it's a slower class ofservice and it has a $25 minimum order threshold in order to qualify for SuperSaver Shipping. So Amazon Prime members have no threshold, and they get two-dayshipping for free. It's a very big change in the customer experience for anAmazon Prime member, and one that we know they love. Our opportunity over time on the cost structure side is alarge one when we have sufficient scale to take advantage of it, because theopportunity is to modify the fulfillment center network so that it's optimizedfor faster delivery. You can imagine that a network optimized for two-daydelivery would look a bit different from a network optimized for standarddelivery. Those kinds of opportunities are available to us in the future as wecontinue to scale.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers.\nDoug Anmuth: I wanted to follow up on Prime. What have the early returnsof Prime been in Japan?Second, can you give us some color on the large amount of hiring that you didduring 3Q? I think you added 1,400 people to your headcount. Was that mostlybased in fulfillment centers, or was there another part of the business?\nJeff Bezos: The answer to the second part of your question is yes, themajority of that was fulfillment center related as we get ready for the holidayseason. Those are largely variable personnel as we grow our business in Q4. In terms of the Prime question as it relates to Japan it'svery, very early. From what we see so far we're very pleased. Customers lovethe offering that we have. They are very excited about it, so it's still very,very early but we're getting very good feedback from customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay - SanfordBernstein.\nJeffrey Lindsay: We had a couple of things we wanted to ask about. Weunderstand from the press that there's some dispute about the patentexclusivity of 1-Click. Could you give us some guidance on how significant theloss of 1-Click patent exclusivity could be for Amazon? Second, could you also give us some guidance on what thepotential impact could be from loss of the Borders book business in 2008? Finally,could you just give us an indication of how well you're doing in freshgroceries? Thank you.\nJeff Bezos: In terms of 1-Click,we have a longstanding practice of not talking about such matters outside ofour public filings. You should refer to our public filings. In terms of the other parts of your question, the grocerypiece, we have a category, dry goods/grocery that we're very pleased with theperformance to-date. It's a great way for customers to buy a number ofdifferent dry goods, an assortment of dry goods items, generally in bulk. So weare very excited about what we see there so far. But again, it's still veryearly.\nJeffrey Lindsay: We were wondering about the Borders book business? Could youcomment on that?\nJeff Bezos: I don't really have any comments on any specific contracts.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shawn Milne - Oppenheimer.\nShawn Milne: Tom, I just have a couple of housekeeping questions. Interms of your revenue growth guidance in the fourth quarter, are you assumingany material follow-on impact from Harry Potter? I just wanted to follow up on the fulfillment question. Itdid dip below as a percent of sales a little bit from what we were looking for.Are you seeing any impact already from what Jeff was talking about in terms ofscale with the fulfillment network? Or is it just the Harry Potter impact onfulfillment costs in the third quarter? Thanks.\nJeff Bezos: In terms of the impact of Q4 as it relates to Harry PotterVII, there certainly will be sales that will happen related to Harry PotterVII, but it won't be as sizable as what you're seeing in Q3, or at least we'renot anticipating that. In quarters where we've had sales such as that, that hasbeen the biggest impact. In terms of fulfillment, what you're seeing is justleveraging our overall fulfillment center infrastructure. I don't have anyother comments beyond that.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Colin Sebastian - LazardCapital Markets.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks for taking my questions, two quick ones, one is a follow-upon Prime. Obviously, you're seeing a positive impact there on unit sales andsubscriptions doubled year over year. I'm wondering if you have begun marketingthat more aggressively off of the website? If so, what traction you might beseeing there?\nJeff Bezos: Not in any significant way. Most of our marketing is to our existingcustomers on the website.\nColin Sebastian: On FPS, the Flexible Payment Service, I'm curious what kindof traction you are seeing for that service early on? What kinds of retailersare you seeing adopt the service? Thank you.\nJeff Bezos: For anybody else on the call who may not know this, FPSstands for Flexible Payment Service. It is one of our infrastructure web services,with the Elastic Compute Cloud, the Simple Storage Service, and the Simple QueueService. These services are all developer-facing services, so they are a set ofAPIs that software developers can use to build web scale applications. Obviously if you're building web scale applications, in manycases you have to be able to charge people for things. The Flexible PaymentService is the first payment service specifically designed from the ground upfor developers, and it has a lot of features that make it very flexible andeasy to use for developers to incorporate payments into their own applications. So that set of services that we're offering to developers isgrowing very, very rapidly and has gotten an unusual amount of traction. We arevery, very gratified to see this early uptake in the development community.It's happening at the very small scale with small software developers;one-person and two-person shops. It's also happening at the middle scale withventure capital-funded startups; and then at the large scale, with enterprisecustomers all the way from the small up to the big. So it's a very exciting andnew product offering. These infrastructure services are things that we needed tobuild for ourselves in order to run the web scale application called Amazon.While we were in the process of building these things, we decided to build themin an external way so we could charge for them and turn them into a new profitcenter. We're very excited about this.\nKim Nelson: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for yourquestions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website atleast through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.comand look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-07-25 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com second quarter 2007 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Kim Nelson. Please go ahead.\nKim Nelson: Hello and welcome to our Q2 2007 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 24, 2007 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2006 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR web site, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2006. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Kim. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 87% to $700 million, while the combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding decreased 2% to $435 million. Worldwide revenue grew 35% to $2.89 billion, or 33% excluding the $46 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $1.83 billion, up 27% or 25% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $970 million, up 55% or 53% excluding FX. EGM continued to increase its share of our worldwide sales mix, representing 34% of sales in Q2 of 2007, up from 29% for the same period last year. Our worldwide unit growth was 25%, and active customer accounts exceeded 69 million, up 16% year over year. Worldwide gross profit was $701 million, up 38%. Gross margin increased 49 basis points to 24.3%, primarily due to the wind down and termination last year of our contract with TRU, which negatively impacted worldwide gross margins in Q2 2006 by approximately 90 basis points and North America gross margin by approximately 170 basis points. This was offset partially by product mix. Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.1 million, and third-party units, representing Marketplace and Merchants@ units sold on Amazon sites, were 30% of total units versus 29% in the prior year. Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $536 million or 18.6% of sales, an improvement of 148 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $248 million or 8.6% of net sales, up 8 basis points year over year. In the quarter, we announced plans for a new fulfillment center in Phoenix, and we opened up a fulfillment center in Guangzhou, China. Technology and content was $176 million or 6.1% of net sales, an improvement of 99 basis points year over year as we continue to grow into our new level of spending. In 2007, technology and content will increase in absolute dollars, but we expect the growth rate of our spending in T&C to be significantly less than it was in 2006. Now I'll talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we cannot allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 38% to $1.6 billion. This is the highest growth rate in more than six years. Media revenue grew 26% to $923 million. EGM revenue grew 66% to $606 million, representing 38% of North America revenues, up from 32%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics; and revenue from soft goods -- which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes and sporting goods -- doubled year over year. North America gross profit grew 40% to $434 million, and gross margin increased 34 basis points. North America segment operating income increased 233% to $82 million, a 5.1% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue was $1.28 billion, up 31% year over year or 26% adjusted for the $45 million favorable foreign exchange impact. Media revenue grew 27% to $910 million or 23% excluding FX. In EGM, revenue grew 40% to $364 million or 34% excluding FX. International gross profit grew 34% to $267 million or grew 29% excluding FX, while gross margin increased 48 basis points to 20.8%, which reflects increased third-party mix offset partially by lower prices, product mix and free shipping offers. International segment operating income increased 50% to $83 million, a 6.4% operating margin. Excluding the $3 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International operating income increased 42%. Consolidated segment operating income grew 106% to $165 million or 5.7% of net sales, up 198 basis points year over year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 149% to $116 million or 4% of net sales. Our provision for income taxes was $33 million in Q2 or a 30% rate for the quarter, which includes a $4 million year-to-date adjustment to reflect our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate of 26%, which incorporates our strong North America growth. As a reminder, there's potential for significant volatility of our effective tax rate, due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of tax flow income by jurisdiction. In 2007, we anticipate cash paid for income taxes will be approximately $25 million, compared to $15 million in 2006, as we continue to benefit from NOLs in the United States. NOL utilization is impacted by many factors, including our excess stock-based compensation deductions. GAAP net income was $78 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with $22 million and $0.05 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities were $1.66 billion, an increase of $245 million year over year. Inventory increased 41% to $735 million, and inventory turns decreased from 14.3 a year ago to 12.9 as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories. Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased $38 million from a year ago to $443 million. Our return on invested capital was 39%. ROIC is free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, intercompany balances in foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material impact on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q3, we expect net sales of between $3 billion and $3.175 billion or growth of between 30% and 38%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $75 million and $110 million or grow between 88% and 175%. This includes approximately $50 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $125 million and $160 million, or grow between 73% and 122%. For the calendar year 2007, we expect net sales of between $13.8 billion and $14.3 billion or growth of between 29% and 34%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $540 million and $640 million or growth of between 39% and 65%. This includes approximately $185 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $725 million and $825 million or grow between 45% and 65%. We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with some variability from changes in working capital. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250 million. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We're confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.\nKim Nelson: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley.\nDave Joseph: Dave and Mary here, and we just have really one question. It seems like you saw a pretty strong improvement in gross margin. I know that there was a one-time impact there, but it also seems that there might be third-party sales at work there which continue to be strong, or so it seems. I guess our question is twofold. One is, why do you think you're seeing such strong traction in third-party sales right now? How important is this to the improvement of Amazon's gross margins going forward? In other words, how sustainable do you think this is?\nTom Szkutak: Sure. As it relates to third parties, as we have been mentioning really over the past few years, we have been investing in improving what we call seller platforms, and that's surrounding everything that makes it easier for sellers to sell, which includes third parties as well as ourselves. So I think what you are seeing is certainly an improvement in third-party sales, third-party units were 30% for the quarter as a percentage of total units, which is up from 29%. Certainly, some of that is the launch of Merchants@ International, which we have mentioned on previous calls. Certainly, that's what you're seeing there. In terms of the importance of it overall, I'll talk about it in terms of our free cash flow rather than our gross margins. We think that this model of having us as a seller as well as third-party is very important for customers, and also works for us financially as well. So what the customer sees is they get additional selection that they might not ordinarily get from us by having third parties. They also get the benefit of seeing where there's overlap, seeing competing sellers on our detail pages which they can select from. So we think the combination of these factors is great for customers and great for shareholders and so we think it should be a meaningful part of our business as we move forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs.\nAnthony Noto: You mentioned the third-party business being launched internationally but it looks like the bulk of your acceleration in revenue is from your North American business growing 38% year over year in the first quarter, while International decelerated. So I want to focus in on that. When we look at the domestic business's acceleration and we drill down, it looks like it accelerated in both media and EGM; EGM being the biggest factor, up 66% versus 51% in the first quarter. My question is very specifically, what drove the most incremental dollars in North American EGM to drive that 66% year-over-year growth, which category?\nTom Szkutak: We're not providing details on the specific categories that make up EGM, but in terms of what's driving it is customers are responding to what they believe is an excellent value proposition which includes low prices, fast delivery and increased selection. As part of that, fast delivery, Prime is certainly a factor. Prime is a more meaningful part of our overall units during Q2 than it has been previously, so we have more subscribers, as well as they are buying more. So that is certainly a key driver. One other thing to keep in mind is in addition to those key factors, as you look at year over year specifically for North America, keep in mind that last year Q2 we had the impact of the wind down and determination of TRU, which infected our revenue by approximately $20 million, which we disclosed last year during Q2. So keep that in mind as you look at our overall growth results in EGM as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities.\nJeetil Patel: Good quarter, guys. A couple of questions. As you look at your growth in newer categories, non-media-related, can you talk about, what is the growth a result of? Is it actually more the consumer experience and what Amazon has continued to present to the consumer? Or do you think it is more the seller economics from a third-party standpoint? Second, as you look at the penetration of third party, it looks like about 50% to 55% of U.S. units and maybe around 5% to 10% in the UK, given the strength domestically. Can you talk about how do you grow or expand the third-party business internationally? What are the critical success factors for you to get to a 50/55 split internationally as you see in the U.S.?\nJeff Bezos: In terms of the overall numbers, we have not actually provided any numbers by segment. So the numbers that you are quoting, we haven't provided what the third-party units are by segment. Overall, it's 30% as a percentage of total. What we have said though is that our North America is higher than International, so there's clearly an opportunity there. But in terms of how we drive it, it's consistent with what we've said in the past. We are continuously focused on how to make the experience better for customers as well as sellers. So you're talking about some of the new categories as part of your question. What we're finding is, when you launch a new category you need traffic to those detail pages. As you get more meaningful traffic to those detail pages, it becomes more attractive for third-party sellers to participate. So that's the best way for us to help our third-party business; it is the same as it is to help our retail business, which is to make that customer experience great. When we do that, it attracts customers and traffic to our detail pages, which is good for sellers, which ultimately is good for customers, having these offers, as well as investors. So that's how they intertwine.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup.\nMark Mahaney: Jeff, could you provide an update on some of the music and/or video offerings, how Amazon [caller dropped]\nJeff Bezos: Speakerphone, perhaps? If you could pick up.\nTom Szkutak: We just can't hear your question.\nJeff Bezos: Yes, if you could repeat the question?\nMark Mahaney: Sorry, I apologize. An update on some of the digital media offerings, video and what kind of traction you are seeing in that? Thank you.\nJeff Bezos: On some of the digital media offerings, could you discuss the traction that you are seeing? Is that the question? Sorry, you are breaking up a little bit.\nMark Mahaney: Yes. We are having a power outage.\nJeff Bezos: It's too early for us to discuss any of the traction we're seeing . As you know, we have Amazon Unbox, which has downloadable videos, and have made arrangements with TiVo so that we can offer customers those videos directly to their TiVo Series 2 and Series 3 Internet-connected boxes. Then we have announced but not yet launched an MP3 DRM-free music offering that we're very excited about, but you'll have to wait and stay tuned for that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Pitz - Banc of America.\nBrian Pitz: Can you provide some additional color on the impact of Harry Potter attachments in the quarter? Can you also give us any sense for advertising on the site, the potential impact there? Because we have been seen more and more advertisements throughout. Thanks.\nJeff Bezos: In terms of the impact of Harry Potter 7, you're relating to Q2? Is that your question?\nBrian Pitz: Yes.\nJeff Bezos: In terms of Harry Potter 7, all of the shipments of the book are happening during Q3 but the associated attachments, our normal practice is to ship those products as they become available. So the impact on Q2 was less than 100 basis points globally. There's certainly also some traffic in addition to that, which is difficult to quantify what the incremental impact of that is. But in terms of the attachments themselves, it's less than 100 basis points.\nBrian Pitz: Any color on advertising, any impact there? Or not really material yet?\nJeff Bezos: Could you be more specific with your question?\nBrian Pitz: Is advertising becoming a more material line item, would you say, going forward? Because we have been seeing a lot more advertisements throughout the site.\nJeff Bezos: We haven't broken it out. Certainly, we're testing a number of things and seeing how they work. But that's the way we are thinking about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns.\nRobert Peck: Tom, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about free cash flow here. One of the great things about Amazon historically is you have managed your share count very well. It looks like this quarter you issued about 5.8 million shares, compared to last year for the full year you did around 9 million to 10 million, of which you bought back about 6 million or so. How do we think about the use of the free cash flow in 2007 and 2008, as we think about the increase of your shares, having almost doubled over the last three or four months? To buyback those 10 million shares would cost you north of $750 million. So how should we think about the allocation of the free cash flow going forward?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of just one correction, maybe I might have misheard what you said. In terms of the share repurchase, you mentioned 6 million or 7 million. We actually purchased 14.5 million shares, which is $500 million over the past year. Maybe I just misheard the way you said it.\nRobert Peck: I meant calendar year.\nTom Szkutak: Calendar year, okay. In terms of looking forward, what we have said, certainly, is we have Board authorization to purchase up to $500 million worth of shares over the next two years. We also have an authorization to retire up to $500 million of debt. But what you should expect to see is, similar to what we have done in the past, we're going to think about it very thoughtfully in making sure that we do what is right for shareholders. We have been very mindful; certainly, we have retired debt that we think is appropriate. We talked about the 14.5 million shares that we repurchased over the past three or four years. We've also retired some convertible debt that avoided potential dilution of just under 10 million shares. So those are some of the examples of things that we've done in the past. But going forward, certainly, we will certainly be very mindful and do the right thing from a treasury and corporate finance perspective as we think about those decisions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers.\nDoug Anmuth: Typically, in the past, when EGM has spiked as a percentage of your sales, it's negatively impacted gross margins a little bit. But here, EGM came in at 34% and you still posted some good gross margin upside. So can you talk more specifically about the drivers within gross margins and also whether the mix within EGM during the quarter was any different than it has been in the past? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the gross margins, keep in mind gross margins for the quarter were up 50 basis points year over year. Keep in mind what I mentioned earlier relating to the wind down and termination of TRU, the impact that had on both revenue as well as gross profit and operating profit being a similar amount in terms of that termination. Now, that being said, those categories, meaning toys, baby and videogames, you should assume that as we launch those, those are like other categories that we launch, that when we launch new categories we are pricing our products very competitively and that they are lower gross margins to start with. So it's not a full impact of that 20 that you are seeing year over year. So those are some of the dynamics related to that. But in terms of other, we continue to have great low prices for customers. Offsetting that, we continue to be diligent on the COGS side, trying to get additional COGS out. Also what you're seeing, to make up the balance is specifically around third party, third party being 30% of total units, up from 29%. That's certainly overlapping where some of the toys was certainly third-party business last year, Q3. So that's taking into account that. So that would have been higher if that wasn't in there, if that makes sense. So those are some of the key drivers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: A couple things on the operating expense line. It looks like tech expense reaccelerated a bit. It was up $15 million sequentially. Any new initiatives on the tech side that you're excited about? Then on the marketing side, it looks like it was up 22% year over year, below revenue growth. Are you seeing some deflation in marketing costs, or could that have been just some Harry Potter traffic benefits that you got in the quarter?\nTom Szkutak: I'll take the marketing one first. Marketing was 2.2% of revenue. If you look back, really, over the past two to three years, the range has been fairly tight; it has been anywhere from 2.2% to 2.7%. Certainly, this past quarter was at the lower end of that range. But there's nothing really unusual about that. I wouldn't expect it to, over time, to stay at the lower end of that range as you're thinking about it. In terms of technology and content, as we have said, we're going to continue to grow technology and content dollars. They were up about 16% year over year. Certainly, you're seeing some very positive leverage in the quarter due to that, because last year, Q2 was up 63%. So that's the delta that you are seeing, but we continue to invest in digital and web services, improving seller platforms, this category expansion that's included in those numbers as well, and other customer experience things that we are working on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Aaron Kessler - Piper Jaffray.\nAaron Kessler: First, on the web services, you're getting increasing traction there; maybe where you're seeing the best traction, and what do you see as the biggest opportunity, starting with Amazon web services? On the gross margin, domestic right now is about 6% ahead of international. Any reason we should think that international can't get similar to domestic longer term, assuming that you can get to a similar level of third-party sales? Thank you.\nJeff Bezos: I'll take the web services one, and Tom can take the gross margins one. We are seeing very good early traction in our web services initiatives. It's one of the areas that we have been investing in over the last couple of years. It's very encouraging to see that traction. We've got a lot of great customers, and the team that's doing that is creating a lot of value for those customers. They are making it much easier for those customers to do business. This customer set is developers. A lot of them are start-up companies. If you are a start-up company building a web scale application, there's a lot of work that has to go into that. A lot of that work is not differentiating. So it's things like picking the right operating systems, getting your data centers set up and entering into contracts, et cetera, et cetera. There are a lot of decisions to be made and it's kind of a price of admission. It has to be done well, but it doesn't actually move the ball forward in terms of creating your differentiated product or service. So what Amazon Web Services does is make it easy for people, for developers, start-up companies and bigger companies; we're seeing a wide range of adoption from individuals, start-up companies of a single person to venture capital-funded start-up companies, all the way to very large corporations using these services. So we're very optimistic about the long-term potential. It's still very early, but we're working very hard on this, and we think it's, in the long-term, a very important business. We are very, very glad and we feel very lucky to have this new set of customers to work with, these developers.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the other part of your question related to gross margins, keep in mind that each of the countries that we operate in have their own local competitors. In any given quarter or time period you could have competitive dynamics which would make our gross margins on any particular category either higher or lower. But that being said, if you step back for a moment, from a structural standpoint, we don't think that there's a lot of differences of why or reasons why that they couldn't be similar over time. So the biggest thing that we need to do is we have a lot more selection today, as we have more categories in our U.S. web site. We have been expanding our international categories, as you have noticed over the past several years. But inclusive of the last couple quarters, you should expect to see an additional selection being added and new categories over the next 12 months in international. We talked about the third-party piece being more meaningful in North America versus international and some of the dynamics around that. So again, as we improve the customer experience, we think that that will be helpful to our international web sites, to bring those closer. As we get more meaningful in terms of size, in terms of negotiating better deals with suppliers, in terms of just higher rebates, just because of the sheer volume that we purchase, we think will get better. So all those things are helpful as we continue to grow, and we will have the ability to make those closer and closer over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus.\nScott Devitt: Thank you. The question relates to the U.S. business. There doesn't seem to have been a significant change in new users or new customers to the site, but the revenue growth rate acceleration is certainly meaningful. So I'm trying to see if you can give some detail, in terms of frequency changes in terms of purchasing patterns of the customer set, within Prime versus your other customers. I ask because the Media category, which is one of the more mature categories of the business, has accelerated now by 1,100 basis points if you go back to September of 2006. It seems as if that category benefits most from frequency increases of the Prime customer. Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: We haven't disclosed any of the frequency patterns between Prime and non-Prime customers. But certainly, to get back to the drivers of what's helping our North America growth, the value proposition, low prices and fast delivery which includes, certainly, Prime is a big deal for us. It's certainly having an impact on our overall growth rate and becoming more meaningful as part of our overall units. It's impacting both media categories as well as EGM. In terms of frequency, we like what we see across the board, but particularly we like what we are seeing in Prime as it relates to frequency, because that's really what the program is designed to do, and that's what we are seeing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Imran Khan \u2013 JP Morgan.\nImran Khan: Obviously, your U.S. growth rate is pretty strong. I was wondering, how should we think about the international business? What are you doing to reaccelerate that business from this level? Not that the growth rate is bad, but reaccelerate to get to the U.S. level. Secondly I think, Tom, you touched a little bit about improving gross profit margin in the International market. There's a 700 basis points difference between U.S. versus International. Could you comment on that, how quickly we can see that gap narrow?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of what are we doing with international, it was some of the things that I mentioned earlier, where we have been launching new categories, increasing selection and focused on improving the overall customer experience. Some of the things that we have done for Amazon.com, our U.S. website, we're also doing in international. One example of that is we launched Prime in Japan recently, so that's certainly something that we've found certainly meaningful for our U.S. website and are hopeful for Japan as well. So that's just another example. But there are many things that we're working on to try to improve the overall customer experience, which includes increased selection. Another one is certainly when we launched Merchants@ International. We showed the revenue growth. We had, actually, very solid unit growth in International, and one of the reasons why was because of launching Merchants@ International. So giving customers more additional selection that they didn't have before, on top of our growing retail selection has been helpful. So those are the things that we're working on to try to maximize our growth in International.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shawn Milne - Oppenheimer.\nShawn Milne: Thank you and a good quarter. A lot has been talked about or asked about your third-party business. If we actually strip out the Toys 'R' Us units or what we estimate as the Toys 'R' Us units last year, we were estimating -- this is the third quarter in a row -- of 50% third-party unit growth. You talked about some of the structural changes you made to Seller Central. Do you think there has also been an uptick here on how you structured the actual buying experience or enabling sellers to get access to the Buy Box on Amazon on how that has impacted the third-party business? We've heard pretty big upticks in unit volume from sellers that have been able to get inside that box. If you can talk about that. Secondly, your incremental margin in the quarter was 11%. That's the highest I've seen in six or seven years. Tom, can you discuss a little bit, are we very quickly going to reach double-digit operating margins or are there other big investments? If you can talk about some of the other areas you are going to invest in in the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Well, in terms of seller experience, there's a number of things that we're working on with seller experience. I'm not sure really, what you're referring to as it relates to the Buy Box in terms of changes. But there's a number of things we're working on to improve the seller experience. You mentioned some of them in Seller Central. Another one which improves the customer experience and we think the seller experience is Fulfilled by Amazon or FBA. That's something that's very, very early for us. But again, it allows customers to buy from third-party merchants with us as the fulfiller. So that's something that we think is worth noting, even though it's still very early. So it's a way to improve the seller experience so the seller can focus on all of the other aspect associated with running their business, but not have to worry about the fulfillment side. So we think that that's clearly important. Again, a number of other seller experience initiatives as well. In terms of the operating margins as we've said in the past, nothing has changed. Our focus is to grow, to provide a great customer experience which we think will translate into maximizing free cash flow per share, and we are very focused on that over time. In terms of the level of operating margins, we've said that we think that double-digit operating margins are possible. That's not a projection, but they are possible. But what we're going to do is focus on maximizing free cash flow per share. If it works out to be that that's double-digit operating margins or some high single digits, that's fine. But again, the way to do that is to drive operating profit dollars, continue to work on leveraging our operating cycle as well as our fixed investment. We think those are the things that will help us get there.\nJeff Bezos: I would just add on Fulfillment by Amazon, that the early sellers who are using that program, we're getting very positive feedback from them. It does accelerate their sales, because the consumers on Amazon, the buying customers, as soon as a seller starts using Fulfillment by Amazon, the buyers get to enjoy Free Super Saver Shipping; they get to enjoy the privileges of Amazon Prime membership on those items. So when a seller switches to Fulfillment by Amazon, a lot of the things that customers associate with items sold directly by Amazon all of a sudden apply from a customer experience point of view to those seller-sold items as well. That's a big deal for Amazon Prime members to be able to buy those items. So, as sellers join Fulfillment by Amazon, they can see an acceleration in sales, because of the improved customer experience of having Amazon do the fulfillment: offer free shipping, offer Fulfillment by Amazon, gift wrapping, next-day air shipment, et cetera, et cetera, all the things that we have worked hard over the last dozen years to get good at, those things automatically become something that's easy for sellers to offer their customers as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford Bernstein.\nJeffrey Lindsay: International growth was good, but not as good as the U.S. I'd like to ask, why was this? Is it a product mix issue? Could we assume that international will eventually catch up with the U.S.?\nTom Szkutak: It's some of the things that I mentioned earlier in the call. Clearly, we're seeing what I would consider very solid growth in international today, and North America certainly has accelerated. Again, it's really driven by the value proposition, the pricing as well as fast delivery and fast delivery Prime being the big piece of that. Certainly, one way to help do that, which is what we're doing is in this case, launching Prime in Japan as one example of a way to make that happen. Also, we have a bigger selection in our North America business or our U.S. website, and we're expanding selection rapidly in our international websites as well. So that's another way of trying to get an experience that's better and better for customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse.\nHeath Terry: Thank you. In the past, you've talked about using the margin leverage or the incremental leverage that you had in the business as fuel to lower prices and drive more free cash flow growth through the model. Should we assume that the margin growth that we're seeing here suggests that you guys feel like you have hit the sweet spot as far as lower prices are concerned, and that lower prices from here won't necessarily drive higher free cash flow and that we really should start to expect more margin exchange?\nTom Szkutak: No, you shouldn't assume that. You should assume that we're going to continue to make sure it's a very dynamic environment. There are many, many competitors out there in each of the categories that we sell in, on all of our websites around the world. Again, so we're going to continue to make sure that we have great prices for customers, and that's critical to the customer experience that we provide. It's one of the pillars that we have talked frequently about, so ultimately we're trying to make sure that we offer that great value proposition, which includes pricing, and it's the foundation of what we do. Nothing has changed there.\nKim Nelson: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-04-25 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com first quarter 2007 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mrs. Kim Nelson. Please go ahead.\nKim Nelson: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2007 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, April 24, 2007 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2006 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today\u2019s call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2006. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thanks, Kim. I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12 month free cash flow increased 4% to $521 million, while the combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding decreased 2% to $430 million. Worldwide revenue grew 32% to $3.02 billion, or 29% excluding the $84 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $1.99 billion, up 26% or 23% excluding FX. This is the highest growth rate for worldwide media in three years. EGM revenue increased to $947 million, up 48% or 44% excluding FX. EGM continued to increase its share of our worldwide sales mix, representing 31% of sales in Q107, up from 28% for the same period last year. Our worldwide unit growth was 23% and active customer accounts exceeded 66 million, up 15% year over year. Worldwide gross profit was $719 million, up 31%. Gross margin decreased 17 basis points to 23.8%. Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.1 million and third party units representing marketplace and merchants at units sold on Amazon sites with 30% of total units versus 29% in the prior year. Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined with $540 million, or 17.9% of sales, an improvement of 86 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $253 million, or 8.4% of net sales, up 6 basis points year over year. We continued to increase capacity through efficiencies, as well as adding leased warehouse space to our network. In the quarter, we announced plans for additional warehouses, one in the U.K. and one in France, supporting our international operations. Technology and content was $167 million, or 5.5% of net sales, an improvement of 55 basis points year over year as we continue to grow into our new level of spending. In 2007, technology and content will increase in absolute dollars but we expect the growth rate of our spending in T&C to be significantly less than it was in 2006. Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 30% to $1.62 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $990 million. EGM revenue grew 51% to $564 million, representing 35% of North America revenues, up from 30%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics and revenue from soft goods, which includes jewellery, apparel, shoes and sporting goods, more than doubled year over year. Additionally, we are pleased with the early customer response to our grocery subscription service, which offers automated replenishment plus a 15% additional discount. Some of the most popular items for subscription include diapers, nutrition bars and coffee. North America gross profit grew 29% to $439 million and gross margin decreased 27 basis points to 27.1% from product mix and lowering prices. North America segment operating income increased 39% to $86 million, a 5.3% operating margin, up 34 basis points year over year. In the international segment, revenue grew 35% to $1.39 billion. Revenue growth was 27% adjusting for the $84 million year over year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 31% to $1 billion, or 24% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 44% to $383 million, or 34% excluding FX. International gross profit grew 36% to $280 million, or grew 27% excluding FX, while gross margin increased 9 basis points to 20.1%, which reflects increasing third-party mix, offset partially by lowering prices, product mix, and free shipping offers. International segment operating income increased 61% to $93 million, or 6.7% operating margin, up 109 basis points year over year. Excluding the $7 million favorable impact from FX, international operating income increased 47%. CSOI grew 50% to $179 million, or 6% of net sales, up 69 basis points year over year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 38% to $145 million, or 4.8% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $33 million in Q1, reflecting an effective tax rate of 23%. We expect our effective tax rate in 2007 to be approximately 23%. However, there is potential for significant volatility of our effective tax rate due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction. In 2007, we anticipate cash paid for income taxes will be approximately $25 million compared to $15 million in 2006, as we continue to benefit from NOLs in the U.S. GAAP net income was $111 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared with $51 million and $0.12 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities were $1.42 billion, an increase of $86 million year over year. During the quarter, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock for $248 million, and today we announced authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock over the next 24 months. Inventory increased 40% to $754 million, and inventory turns decreased from 14.4 a year ago to 12.9, as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories. Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased $81 million from a year ago to $442 million. Our return on invested capital was 30%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus the average current liabilities. I will conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marketing our Euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, inter-company balances in foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on our guidance. Our guidance assumes that we do not record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring related estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q2, we expect net sales of between $2.7 billion and $2.85 billion, or growth of between 26% and 33%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $65 million and $105 million, or grow between 39% and 125%. This includes approximately $45 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $110 million and $150 million, or grow between 38% and 88%. For calendar year 2007, we expect net sales of between $13.4 billion and $14 billion, or growth of between 25% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $463 million and $593 million, or growth of between 19% and 52%. This includes approximately $170 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $630 million and $760 million, or growth between 26% and 52%. We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with some variability from changes to working capital, and we expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250 million. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well as our free cash flow, will expand. Thanks, and with that, Kim, let\u2019s move to questions.\nKim Nelson: Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question today will come from Robert Peck from Bear Stearns.\nRobert Peck: Tom, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. One is, could you give us a little bit of color around the spending of S3, EC2, where you see that spending going over the next couple of quarters, and what capacity are you using to handle the demand there? How does that capacity get adjusted for the 4Q? The second question is more on gross margins, where you see gross margins trending over the next couple of quarters, how do you see the impact of any further increased shipping supplements or even the negative shipping stuff you have been testing for Amazon.com? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Could you repeat the gross margin question again? I did not hear the last part of it.\nRobert Peck: The gross margin question is just more of how should we think about gross margins going forward to reflect any further increased shipping rebates, shipping supplements, and even implications of things like -- what is your turnover there?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of gross margins, certainly the endless rebate that you mentioned was also -- that\u2019s the negative $5 shipping, if you will, is included in the results that you saw in Q1, so that is reflected in Q1 and it is reflected, whatever we might do going forward in each of our categories. Certainly reflected in the guidance that we have given, but what you are seeing in Q1 is certainly a contraction in our gross margins, meaning it was down 17 basis points year over year versus what we saw more recently, where it was down 110 basis points for the year, total year 2006 versus total year 2005, as well as a similar number for Q4. What you are seeing really is strength in our third party business, which you saw reflected, particularly in our international gross margins, as well as improvements in COGS. As we move forward, we are certainly still working very hard to get further COGS improvements, and the growth that we have seen in a lot of the categories and the scale that we are getting is helping us do that.\nJeffrey P. Bezos: I will take the EC2 and S3 question, and just say we are -- we do not break it out. We are seeing very strong demand for those services and expect to continue to roll out new capacity for them.\nRobert Peck: Meaning that in the fourth quarter, would you therefore build up more capacity to handle what could be increased demand with that segment?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: We have been adding new capacity for those services and I continue to expect that to continue indefinitely.\nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Noto from Goldman Sachs.\nAnthony Noto: Tom, you alluded to the margins internationally, gross margins benefiting from the increased mix of third party. Those margins on an historic basis relative to the U.S. have been quite a bit below. Do you think as that mix continues to improve, you could get your gross margins internationally to where they are domestically, and if not, why? And then the second question, can you quantify how much you think you benefit from the pre-orders of Harry Potter during this quarter, in terms of incremental traffic or attachment rates from pre-orders? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of international, that is certainly one way which our international and North America gross margins will become closer over time, and so certainly it is an opportunity. Even though we saw nice growth in international third party, it is still -- it is a percentage of total units, not as high a percentage as North America, so it is certainly an opportunity for us going forward, and other areas as well. As you would imagine, in our international segment is a make-up of several different countries, and from a buying perspective as we get to scale in each of those categories and each of those countries, it will help us buy better which will also help us improve margins over time. So those are really the key drivers. In terms of pre-orders, the effect on Q1 has been small. We are very pleased with the pre-orders that we have today for Harry Potter 7, but in terms of the impact on our overall growth rate in Q1, we think it is a pretty small number.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take a question from Mark Mahaney from City Investment Research.\nMark Mahaney: Great, thanks. I want to just follow-up on the third-party sales growth internationally. Could you give us any more clarity on that? Were there particular categories or stores in which you saw that third-party growth, or particular countries? And then, just a real quick question on the tax rate. It seems like it jumps around a lot. Is it reasonable to assume that 23% this year is what it will be like next year, and why the big change or the big bring down in the tax rate guidance? Thank you very much.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. I will take the tax rate question first. There is a lot of variability in the tax rate. The 23% is our best estimate for 2007. It is also our actual effective tax rate for Q1. We are not giving guidance on our effective tax rate going forward beyond 2007 again because of the variability surrounding it. I would like to point out though as well that our cash taxes paid last year were $15 million. We are estimating this year to be approximately $25 million, and so that is related to taxes. In terms of your other question was related to third-party, I think the only other color maybe, you were looking for some additional color, is just to keep in mind that we launched merchants at international in the U.K. and Germany in the second-half of last year. We have more recently launched it in Japan, and so that is certainly a driver, one of the drivers. But one of the other things that we have talked about frequently related to our international business and launching new categories in general, the more traffic we get to those individual categories, good things happen, and what I mean by good things happen, we are able to have, since we have more traffic we are able to get more third-party selling on our detail pages as well as get better COGS improvements over time. That is some of what you are seeing reflected in our Q1 results.\nOperator: We have a question from Scott Devitt from Stifel Nicolaus.\nScott Devitt: Thank you. First, on the breakdown of revenue, Amazon is the only large Internet company where the domestic sales are growing faster than international sales, so I am wondering if you could just talk to, in the markets that you are in internationally, the capacity for growth rates to actually improve with time. I think you noted the launch of marketplaces in the U.K. and Germany. Are there other drivers that in the intermediate term actually could cause the international growth rate to, on an organic basis, be above the domestic rate? And then I had a follow-up.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. We are actually very encouraged by the opportunity that we have globally, but certainly we are seeing at this stage a higher growth rate in North America than in international. EGM is certainly a big opportunity for us, both in North America and in international, and as we have talked about on previous calls, we just have a lot more categories today in North America. Over the next 12 months, you will be seeing more categories coming out, specifically in international, and we are going to continue to add not only new categories but add selection within the categories we are in. So we still think of it as a big opportunity, but you are right; our North America is outpacing international. Certainly as part of that, North America is certainly being helped by Amazon Prime. We are seeing what we -- certainly customers are liking what they see there and that is certainly being reflected in our overall growth rate in North America.\nScott Devitt: Thanks, and the follow-up is related to Amazon Unboxing Tivo, which seems to be an interesting new product. I was interested in the capacity to increase the content, what you think the constraints are in terms of the content owners actually providing the content so that you had a significant increase in selection in that category and the possibility longer term to possibly have a subscription model around that? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Well, we have been and continue to be in the process of adding selection. We just recently added the NHL, the National Hockey League, and you can expect us to continue to go down that path. It is certainly something that is a core brand attribute for Amazon.com, is Earth\u2019s biggest selection, and there are lots of ways to continue to improve that selection and you can count on us to do it. I cannot remember what your -- was there a second part?\nScott Devitt: Subscription model in the movie category; as content increases, the capacity to actually create a subscription model without the same delivery constraints that a competitor may have.\nThomas J. Szkutak: With regard to that, I will not be able to answer just because it is kind of forward-looking. We will have to wait and see how that develops.\nScott Devitt: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank Securities.\nJeetil Patel: Great. Thank you. Good quarter. A couple of questions; first on the web services side, it is certainly a big opportunity. Can you discuss a bit of when does it become a more material component of your business strategy and how you approach customers on the start-up and programming side, and I guess when it becomes a meaningful contributor to the financials? Second, just on the digital music side, I would love to get your thoughts as you are in the music category, to how the MP3 standard competes against the iPod iTunes model, and is there an opportunity there as you look forward here, especially with DRM getting out of the industry altogether? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the web services, it is very early. We are very pleased with the traction that we are getting to date. It is certainly exciting to see, but it is very, very early.\nJeffrey P. Bezos: These are the kinds of things -- I think we are really on to something, given the early initial traction. This is new customer stuff for us. We have been working on it for just a couple of years now, and there are already a very large number of developers using these services. We have gotten very positive feedback from them. We keep enhancing the services. The team here at Amazon that is working on these web services is super passionate about this, very, very excited. It is going to take -- in terms of your question of when it might affect the overall economics of the company, it is going to be -- inside a company of this, of our current scale, it takes a long time for businesses, new businesses to grow to where they have a meaningful impact on the overall. We have seen that previously with things like international, new product categories, and so on, so it is going to require some patience in order to see that have a financial return but it is certainly just excellent early traction.\nJeetil Patel: Jeff, do you think that has the potential to be just as significant as the core retailing business that you are sitting in today?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: The market sizes are potentially very large, and how large it can be, over what kind of time frame, we will have to wait and see. I think it is premature to speculate about that but we are going to keep inventing in that area and working hard to satisfy developer customers.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Pitz from Banc of America.\nBrian Pitz: Thank you. Would you give us a sense as to how much of an impact the mix shift to media from electronics this quarter was helpful to margins? And then a second unrelated, how much of the strong international results were related to the U.K., given that growth over there, both on the advertising and e-commerce side, has been so strong? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of your question around mix, we actually saw very strong growth across both media and EGM over the 12-month period, so I would not necessarily consider it a significant shift in terms of mix. There was certainly a little bit of mix shift within the international piece where we had media growing, it was accelerated and EGM was not, but in total aggregate, we did not really see a big mix shift. In terms of any specific country, you were asking about the U.K., we are not splitting our results out that way. We reported on the two segments, international and North America, but we certainly saw solid growth in international, with growth of 27% ex exchange. That is right in the range that we have seen over the last several quarters. It has been in the 26% to 29% range, and we saw very strong growth in North America, with Q4 and Q1 being really very strong growth versus what we have seen over the past several years in terms of growth rate being 30% and 31% in the last two quarters. So again, seeing very strong growth.\nBrian Pitz: Just a quick follow-up, on Tivo, any new metric you could share with us in terms of the 1.5 million subs that are either buying or renting movies, or any metrics on that front? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: No, we do not have any new metrics to share there.\nOperator: We will go next to Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: If you take the midpoint of your range of GAAP operating income from last quarter to this quarter, I think it went from 3.2 to 3.8, if our calculations are correct, and it seems like it is on the gross profit side but could you talk about why your margin expectations have increased? Are you seeing less price competition in the media categories? Are there any other things that you want to mention that have improved your optimism on your operating margins?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the operating margins, we have improved both our top line, our CSOI, and our implied operating margins for the year. The reason for that is over really the last 90 days, we have seen certainly stronger growth, which customers are telling us that they like the selection and the pricing and the convenience that we have, and so certainly we are seeing the impact of that higher growth, particularly in North America. We also saw better, as I mentioned earlier, better COGS. Again with our revenue being higher, we are just getting better COGS improvements, and as well as our third-party mix. So those are the key things at the gross margin level, and then we were able to, in Q1 we were able to leverage our operating costs with this higher growth rate. If you assume that certainly a portion of our total operating costs is relatively fixed, and so as we increase our revenue like we did, we will be able to leverage that fixed cost infrastructure, which is also helping our operating margins as well.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. One quick follow-up; do you have a number in front of you, what your NOL is right now at this point?\nThomas J. Szkutak: It was $1.7 billion at the end of 2006 is what we reported in the K. We have certainly utilized some of that up during Q1, but beyond that I cannot help you with that number.\nOperator: We will take a question from Douglas Anmuth from Lehman Brothers.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thank you. My question also follows up on your margins, but it is more on the going forward basis. Looking at your outlook, just given the fact that you posted 6% pro forma operating margins in 1Q, and I am trying to figure out what you are thinking over the next nine months of the year, given that the guidance for the full year is 4.7% to 5.4% operating margin, so what specifically could drag down those margins over the next nine months versus where you are now, or -- I am trying to figure out why those numbers are not conservative going forward. Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the range, as you would expect, we do have some volatility in our sales rates as you look out in each of our individual quarters. In other words, just based on the guidance that we have given for Q2, Q2 is generally a lower sales quarter for us just from a seasonality standpoint. As you look at the operating costs, a portion of being fixed as a percentage of that, it obviously would bring down our operating margins. So that is certainly one factor. And then also, there are some mix effects within Q4 being a heavier EGM quarter, but we are -- we increased our CSOI and our income, as well as our implied operating margin for the year based on certainly some of the things that we saw in Q1. Based on the range we have given, we are certainly cautiously optimistic about the rest of the year and the total year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Imran Khan from JP Morgan.\nImran Khan: Thank you very much for taking my questions, two questions; first, if I look at your EGM growth rate in the international market, it decelerated 16 percentage points on a year-over-year basis from 50 to 34. I am just trying to understand if there\u2019s anything specific to this quarter. How should we think about the EGM growth rate in the international market, excluding foreign exchange going forward? Secondly, clearly Amazon Prime was a big success in the U.S. Are you thinking to roll it out in the international market? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of our international EGM growth, it was 34%, so it was solid growth for the quarter but it was down from what it has been more recently. What we did see though was a, on a units basis, we saw an acceleration of unit growth in Q1 for international EGM versus what we have seen in recent quarters. Part of that is this mix that we talked about for third party with the launching of merchants in a few of the countries that I mentioned earlier, so we are pleased certainly with the unit growth that we saw. In terms of Prime, we are certainly very happy with what we are seeing in North America and we will have to wait and see what that means going forward as it relates to other geographies.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Jordan Rohan from RBC Capital.\nJordan Rohan: Thanks. Over the last quarter or so, both Google and Yahoo!, the major paid search engines, have made changes to their algorithms which should I would think benefit Amazon as a strong brand in the placement and the efficiency of its paid search campaign. While I know paid search is not a huge driver of the operating costs, and specifically the sales and marketing, can you speak to whether this had an impact on your efficiency and how you think about it going forward?\nThomas J. Szkutak: No, I really do not have any comments related to that at all.\nJordan Rohan: Thank you very much.\nKim Nelson: -- on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available at our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thank you.\nJeffrey P. Bezos: Thanks."}], "2009": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2008, "date": "2009-01-30 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator instructions) Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.\nRob Eldridge: Hello and welcome to our Q4 \u201808 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Thomas Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, January 29, 2009 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today\u2019s call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Szkutak: Thanks, Rob. Let me start by reviewing our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 16% to $1.36 billion. Return on invested capital was 41%, down from 55%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt, over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 446 million shares compared with 435 million. Worldwide revenue grew 18% to $6.7 billion, or 24% excluding the $320 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rate. Media revenue increased to $3.64 billion, up 9%, or 15% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $2.89 billion, up 31%, or 36% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 43% of worldwide sales, up from 39%. Worldwide unit growth was 28%. Active customer accounts exceeded 88 million, up 16%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.5 million, up 18%. Seller units were 27% of total units versus 26%. Worldwide gross profit was $1.35 billion, up 15%. Now I\u2019ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $989 million, or 14.7% of sales, down 9 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $530 million, or 7.9% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and content was $236 million, or 3.5% of revenue compared with 3.4%. Now I\u2019ll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense/income, net line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 18% to $3.63 billion. Media revenue grew 7% to $1.75 billion. EGM revenue grew 30% to $1.73 billion, representing 48% of North America revenues, up from 43%. We are particularly pleased with Kindle demand during the fourth quarter. We want to remind everyone that Kindle revenue and cost are recognized over a two-year period. The Kindle Store contains the largest collection of e-books available anywhere in the world. Selection increased by 45,000 titles in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to 230,000 titles. 103 out of 112 current New York Times Best Sellers are available and, along with most new releases, are priced at $9.99 or less. In addition, the Kindle Store recently added the Arizona Republic, Baltimore Sun, Orange County Register and USA Today and now offers newspapers from eight of the top ten metro areas in the United States. North America gross profit grew 12% to $781 million and gross margin decreased 114 basis points to 21.5%, driven by lower prices for our customers, including free shipping offers in Amazon Prime, and changes in product mix, partially offset by higher other revenue. North America segment operating income declined 15% to $130 million, a 3.6% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 19% to $3.07 billion. Revenue growth was 31%, adjusting for the $308 million year-over-year unfavorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 12% to $1.89 billion, or 22% excluding FX. And EGM grew 32% to $1.16 billion, or 46% excluding FX. EGM now represents 38% of international revenues, up from 34%. International gross profit grew 20% to $567 million, or grew 32% excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, while gross margin increased 23 basis points to 18.5%, driven by improvements in our vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. International segment operating income increased 31% to $229 million, a 7.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income increased 48%. CSOI grew 9% to $359 million, or 5.4% of revenue, down 44 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $26 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 17%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased $1 million to $272 million, or 4.1% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $79 million in Q4, or 26% rate for the quarter. In 2008, we paid $53 million in cash taxes. A majority of our tax expense is non-cash because we have current tax benefits and NOLs related to excess stock-based compensation. GAAP net income was $225 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared with $207 million and $0.48 per diluted share. Now I\u2019ll discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 29% to $19.17 billion, or 28% excluding $127 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. North America revenue grew 26% to $10.23 billion and international grew 33% to $8.94 billion, or 31% year-over-year growth, excluding the year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI grew 29% to $1.09 billion, or 28% excluding $10 million of favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin remained at 5.7%. GAAP operating income grew 28% to $842 million, or 4.4% of net sales. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $615 million year-over-year to $3.73 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government, and government agency securities, AAA-rated money market funds, and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.2 million of our common stock for $100 million. Inventory increased 17% to $1.4 billion, and inventory turns were 12.2, down half a turn from prior year, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels globally, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 29% to $3.59 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 62 from 57 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $311 million from a year ago to $854 million. Our 2008 capital expenditures were $333 million. I will conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our Euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, intra-company balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolutions of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material effect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q1, we expect net sales of between $4.525 billion and $4.925 billion, a growth of between 9% and 19%. This guidance anticipates approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $125 million and $210 million, or between 37% decline and 6% growth. This includes approximately $75 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $200 million and $285 million, or between 23% decline and 10% growth. This guidance anticipates approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time with some variability, including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Rob, let\u2019s move to questions.\nRob Eldridge: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question this afternoon will come from Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus.\nScott Devitt: Hi, thanks and congratulations on the continued success. I have two questions if I could. They are a little bit longer term in nature. First, I was wondering if you could just comment on the early progress of your large company focus, cloud computing initiative that you recently launched with Gemini and whether you think that you would pursue further initiatives or partnerships in that area to target enterprise level customers. And then secondly, on Amazon Video, which is now being distributed through several partners to get it towards the TV and it\u2019s now a pay-per-view service, could you just comment on what your long-term ambitions are in terms of a business model potentially shifting from pay-per-view toward a subscription model as more digital content is available? Thanks.\nJeff Bezos: I\u2019ll answer those. As far as \u2013 on the first question, we think there is a very significant and meaningful opportunity over time for enterprise level customers with our web services business. This is the Elastic Compute Cloud and the Simple Storage Service are already being used by a number of enterprise level customers, and we expect that trend to continue. On the business models for video, did you say we have a pay-per-view model now? I just wouldn\u2019t want to speculate too much on what we might do in the future.\nScott Devitt: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Citi. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Great. Thanks. Jeff, just on the Kindle, I know you\u2019re not disclosing a lot on it, but any major surprises from your perspective, maybe in terms of overall usage, any cannibalization, or do you just sense that overall it just materially increase the overall book purchases of customers? And then, Tom, really quickly, did you see material signs of discounting in the quarter? I assume you did. And just thoughts on if your strategy for dealing with significant discounting in the marketplace was different this year than in prior years, given the large third party base you have now. Thank you.\nJeff Bezos: With Kindle sales, we see that when people buy a Kindle, they actually continue to buy the same number of physical books going forward as they did before they owned a Kindle. And then incrementally, they buy about 1.6 to 1.7 electronic books, Kindle books, for every physical book that they buy. So, so far what we\u2019re seeing is very strong incremental book unit sales, which of course we\u2019re very pleased to see. The biggest surprises so far for Kindle have just been the unusually strong demand that we saw in the fourth quarter. We had anticipated strong demand, and what we saw was stronger than that. So we are extremely grateful for that, and we will keep marching forward here.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of your second half of your question, Mark, there is absolutely no change in strategy related to pricing. We are trying to make sure we offer a great value to customers. We operate in a very competitive marketplace. And certainly we saw that in Q4, which is reflected in the gross margins that you see in our Q4 results. So again, no change in strategy, and it was certainly very competitive and that\u2019s reflected in the results that you see.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question will come from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: Thank you very much for taking my question. I guess I noticed that your additions drawn under [ph] revenue approximately doubled year-over-year despite Kindle was being out of stock most of the quarter. Could you speak to whether that reflects very strong uptick of Prime or very heavy Kindle sales, the period when they were in stock? And then separately, it looks like your North American media revenue growth decelerated quite sharply from 3Q to 4Q, right? Your international media revenue ex-FX was fairly stable in terms of year-over-year growth rates from 3Q to 4Q. I was wondering if that reflected purely macro economic motives or if there was anything else such as Harry Potter or video game strike there? Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: The other revenue, in addition to the items that you mentioned, contains a number of things, including Prime and our credit card relationships and advertising et cetera. And so we did very solid growth there. In terms of your \u2013 can you repeat the second half of your question, James? Sorry.\nJames Mitchell: Sure. It looks that your North American media growth decelerated I think mid-teens year-over-year growth in the third quarter, 7% in the fourth quarter, whereas your international media revenue growth remained at around 20% in both 3Q and 4Q ex-FX. I was wondering if there was anything kind of special behind the divergence in growth paths other than the US economy path slowing more sharply.\nThomas Szkutak: Yes \u2013 no \u2013 we had \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just the media. It was across the board. If you look at media and EGM, we had stronger growth in international. We saw growth in total exchange of 31% in international. And we have \u2013 we focus on the same things that we focus in North America are the fundamentals, making sure we have great pricing. Certainly Prime is having any impact in international as well as North America, and offering just a great value proposition. Certainly one thing to keep in mind, we look at international though we have launched in addition to adding a lot of selection within existing categories, in all of our categories globally. We\u2019ve launched approximately 25 categories over the past two years or so that certainly have an impact on the growth rates as well.\nJames Mitchell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Looks like a lot of offline retail stores are under some pressure, and there is a lot of store closures. Can you talk a little bit about anything you\u2019ve seen in the music category historically from that? Has it helped you at all? And how can you take advantage of maybe some of that next year, any competitive initiatives that might help the company?\nJeff Bezos: I think it\u2019s difficult to say what, if any, short-term impacts you might see from that. And in the long-term, these are \u2013 fortunately the markets that we operate in are very large markets and there is room for lots of winners. And so I don\u2019t think there is going to be much impact to the long-term \u2013 continue to be a very competitive environment.\nOperator: Mr. Post, any further questions?\nJustin Post: No, that\u2019s all. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will move next to Douglas Anmuth with Barclays Capital.\nDouglas Anmuth: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you talk about how you\u2019ve been impacted or I guess maybe whether you\u2019ve been impacted at all since you\u2019ve begun collecting taxes in New York in the middle part of the year? And then also, what are you seeing in terms of new Prime memberships? Is there any kind of slowdown or deceleration in this type of macro environment? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of sales tax, we collect in certainly a number of states in the US, many jurisdictions outside of the US. In fact, approximately half of our business today that we are actually collecting some type of either sales tax or value-added tax. And we have very good businesses in those geographies. And so I can\u2019t comment much beyond that. In terms of Prime, we are very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in Prime. We have very good subscriber growth and customers like it. We certainly saw that was evidence further in Q4 during the holiday season and reflect in the results that you see for Q4. So again, we\u2019re very pleased. And again, it\u2019s something that we offer in most geographies today, and we\u2019re very pleased with how it\u2019s performing.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Imran Khan with J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan: Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. First, active seller accounts were up 18% on a year-over-year basis. If my memory is correct, it accelerated from 17% in Q3, better understanding what\u2019s really driving the active seller accounts so much for you guys. Second question, it\u2019s been reported that DVD sales are pretty weak. And I was wondering if you are seeing any weakness on the DVD sales. In fact, those changes (inaudible) that, and any comments on Blu-ray. Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the active sellers, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we have three customer sets, are the consumers, sellers, and developers. And we start with those customers in each of the things that we do and work backwards. And we\u2019ve focused very heavily on the seller experience over the last several years, and that\u2019s what\u2019s we believe is driving the active seller account growth. In terms of categories, any accounts on categories within the breakouts that we have, like for DVD, I can\u2019t comment much. And \u2013 but certainly, we think we like the \u2013 you mentioned Blu-ray, we like the Blu-ray business. And we certainly have great selection in DVDs as well as \u2013 in the original format as well as Blu-ray. And you are certainly seeing the customers like that. But beyond that, there is not a lot I can add to it.\nImran Khan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: Great. Thank you. Congrats. Two questions. In the current environment, how much data do you have or analysis do you actually do in your customer base to figure out spending propensities by, say, geographies, zip codes, vintage of when they were added, household income to better forecast the business. Are you getting to that granular level of detail to assess kind of your trend lines of business as you look at Q1 guidance and I guess how you look internally into budgets? And then second, does the current environment, as enterprise level spending slows down, create increased interest or open up the conversation around the web services? What you can provide for enterprises these days, or can you just comment a little bit more about how those conversations are progressing?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the first part of your question, it\u2019s certainly a very data-driven business. And we look at many, many different things, primarily though from a \u2013 when you think about some of the data that we do look at, it\u2019s very heavily focused on the customer experience side, how do we make sure that we are priced appropriately in our products, how we make sure that we\u2019re serving our customers the way we want to and reducing all the customer facing defects in every way that we touch the customer. And so those are the areas that we focus very, very heavily on. And certainly we look at other metrics as you would expect, but that\u2019s really where the focus is. Could you repeat the web services question?\nJeetil Patel: Yes. On web services, I guess there is \u2013 you lower the cost of a computing for companies that utilize the service. I\u2019m curious, as I guess the budgets become tighter as you look ahead for enterprises out there, does that open up the conversation for what you can provide larger companies on web services, or is that still ways to go in terms of that conversation with larger Fortune 500 accounts in the market?\nThomas Szkutak: I think it does open up those conversations. The people are, in this macro environment, looking for ways to save money, and cloud computing does do that. So it improves utilization, improves deficiency. There is a lot that can be done there. And so if you\u2019re looking for a silver lining in the macro environment, I think that is \u2013 what you are suggesting is correct.\nJeetil Patel: Do you think it\u2019s still too early to see the impact of that in terms of, I guess, conversations? Or are we just still too early in terms of the business cycle and the downturn?\nThomas Szkutak: No, I think on the edges, you\u2019re seeing it already. And I suspect that that momentum will continue.\nJeetil Patel: Thanks.\nOperator: We will go next to Jeffrey Lindsay with Sanford Bernstein.\nJeffrey Lindsay: Thank you for taking my question. Could you share with us any of your thinking on your next product categories and your geographic priorities going forward, international versus the US, why you see the kind of expansion opportunities to drive growth going forward? And then could you just mention \u2013 could I ask Tom \u2013 do you plan to put any hedging programs in place? Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the product categories and geographies, fortunately we have a longstanding practice of not talking about which categories will launch next. So I apologize, I can't help on that. But again, we \u2013 in addition, just as a reminder, in addition to looking to new categories to add selection, we\u2019re continually adding selection within the categories that we\u2019re in. In terms of hedging, we are not doing really any hedging today using instruments. We have certainly a lot of natural hedging. And what I mean by that we are predominantly in those geographies that we operate in. We\u2019re pricing in local currency. The vast majority of both the COGS as well as operating costs are in local currency. We\u2019re certainly exposed to the income and the cash flows that we generate in those geographies, but we\u2019re not hedging those. That\u2019s something that\u2019s been consistent for sometime, and again because we\u2019re taking as long-term view and again trying to approach it mostly from a natural perspective.\nJeffrey Lindsay: Thank you.\nOperator: Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray, your line is open.\nGene Munster: Good afternoon, and congratulations on impressing results. If you could talk a little bit about the margin side of the equation? I know you had briefly touched on it, but a lot of the offline retailers had given up top line \u2013 given up bottom line to hit top line. And you guys got the best of both worlds. It sounds like that going forward you don\u2019t see any changes into how you think about gross margin. If the environment would get progressively more difficult, do you see yourself potentially changing some of your perspective on margins and intend to keep the traffic in the volume and keep building the platform that\u2019s been successful?\nThomas Szkutak: There is no \u2013 again, we operate in a competitive environment. Like we talked about earlier as well as in the past calls that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019re going to offer great values to customers. You can expect that to continue going forward. We certainly did see an impact and you can see that our gross margins during Q4. We had a larger decline certainly than we\u2019ve had year-over-year than we\u2019ve had \u2013 if you look at the trailing 12-month trend, and that\u2019s one of the reasons that certainly pricing is certainly a part of that, but certainly a foundation of our models to make sure that we offer great value to customers and we\u2019ll continue to do so going forward.\nGene Munster: Thank you.\nOperator: Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company.\nYoussef Squali: Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the same kind of line of questioning. As \u2013 I guess with the ongoing closure of brick-and-mortar stores, short-term not within next two years as you were talking about earlier, but short-term within the next three to six months, what is the risk to pricing from just the \u2013out of inventory that\u2019s likely to persist from the troubled retailers through the summer? How much of that have you kind of modeled into your numbers? And then a quick question for Tom. The midpoint of Q1 implies about a 14% in revenue growth and about 3.5% margin versus 4.8% in Q1 of last year, where do you see the most pressure on the P&L? Is it on the gross margin side or in OpEx? Thanks.\nJeff Bezos: In terms of the first part of your question, that\u2019s really hard to know. And so if you look at our Q1 guidance, you can see that we\u2019ve given a pretty wide range. If you look at the high end of the range, you can see that the growth rate, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, would be 25%, little bit above where we came in in Q4. If you look at the bottom line CSOI, the growth rate excluding the impact of exchange is approximately when we came in again in Q4. But again it\u2019s a wide range. And that wide range reflects both the macro environment and the uncertainty. And so we think it\u2019s appropriately conservative but reflects that uncertainty.\nYoussef Squali: And Tom?\nOperator: Mr. Squali, any further questions, sir?\nYoussef Squali: Yes. Maybe just a follow-up on the second question for Tom about the impacts on the P&L from the \u2013 what the implied guidance implies? Is there more of a pressure on gross margin or the P&L \u2013 I\u2019m sorry \u2013 or OpEx?\nThomas Szkutak: Yes. In terms of \u2013 we\u2019re not giving line item detail in terms of our guidance range. But if you take a look at Q4, you can see that our operating margins were down year-over-year. And that was largely driven by gross margins being down. All that said, we still had growth in CSOI as well as free cash flow, and the revenue growth of 24% excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. So that\u2019s what we saw in Q4. And we\u2019ll have to get back to you when we close the quarter and share with you what happened in Q1.\nYoussef Squali: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: Thanks. Good afternoon. So the North American operating expenses were up about 19% year-over-year. I know that includes a lot of the allocation for the technology and content cost. But I was wondering if you could just speak to excluding some of the growth initiatives like Kindle, what was the kind of underlying cost growth in North America. And then secondly, I know you guys bought back about $100 million of stock in the fourth quarter, which was I think the first time all year you bought back stock. Can you just help us understand how you\u2019d be redeploying your free cash flow in \u201909? Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the first question, we haven\u2019t split out the operating expenses by segment, but you can see it in total. You can see that we did get some leverage in our total operating expense. One thing to keep in mind is, when you look at our operating expense for Q4, it does not reflect just what happened in Q4. In other words, we were adding resources throughout the year in 2008. You can see from looking at the headcount that we had in \u2013 the reporting that we show in the press release that certainly our headcount growth slowed in Q4 \u2013 sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And so again, we\u2019re not giving line item details, but you can look at the totals between G&A, marketing, technology and content, and G&A for our business. In terms of the \u2013 from a cash standpoint, we\u2019re not \u2013 there is not a lot I can comment on going forward. What I can tell you related to the $100 million was an opportunistic buy. And we\u2019re being what we believe to be appropriately conservative with our cash.\nSpencer Wang: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Sandeep Aggarwal with Collins Stewart.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Thanks for taking my question. Just if you can talk about, Jeff, on the Prime members in terms of as they enter from one year to second year, have you seen their propensity to buy changing and what about the average selling price? And we\u2019ll appreciate any comments in terms of the traction you are seeing with Fulfillment by Amazon.\nJeff Bezos: Sure. One of the things that we see with Prime in terms of customer behavior is that Amazon Prime members tend to buy a wider range of categories, of product categories. And we also see incremental lift from those customers. I think both of those things you would expect to see given the people have made a commitment by buying the $79 membership and equivalent kinds of memberships for different prices around the world. So anyway, that\u2019s \u2013 Amazon Prime is doing what we hoped it would do in that regard. And we\u2019re pleased with the traction. We work very hard to make sure that the customer experience for Prime members makes it worth their while to pay that $79 and to renew that membership. Fulfillment by Amazon is getting very good traction. And one of the nice kind of closing of a feedback cycle there is that you get now some of the third party sales are eligible for Amazon Prime. So, to the degree that customers like Amazon Prime and to the degree that sellers like Fulfillment by Amazon, they are closing that loop and helping each other. So we are very pleased with both of those programs. Every time a third party seller starts using Fulfillment by Amazon, their sales go up, which the seller likes. And the customers all of a sudden get Amazon Prime membership privileges on those third party items, which the consumer likes. So the two things that really is nice to close that loop, and we\u2019re excited about the potential that will keep pushing ahead on it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heath Terry with FBR Capital Markets.\nHeath Terry: Great, thank you. Jeff, can you look at the third party efforts in Europe? How would you compare the growth and the product offering and the composition of your partners there to where the US was at the same stage of that business? And then also if you can give us an idea of if you\u2019ve seen any attrition in your third party seller base in the US or Europe that you might feel would be related to the economy, I\u2019d appreciate it.\nJeff Bezos: Anecdotally I don\u2019t think we have seen the kind of attrition that you\u2019re talking about. We are \u2013 our third party business continues to do well. And as Tom said earlier, we\u2019ve been working for many years on the seller experience and we will continue to work on that. And with things like Fulfillment by Amazon, it is one of the ways that we work on improving that seller experience.\nHeath Terry: Great. And then as far as how Europe compares to the US at the same point and your development of that offering there?\nJeff Bezos: We don\u2019t break that out, at least quantitatively. But we are very happy with the way that third party sellers are \u2013 how that\u2019s performing globally.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Friedland: The P&L from Q4, there was some leverage than usual gains on a year-over-year basis in Fulfillment and a little bit in G&A as well. And I was just wondering if there is anything unique going on there, were there any one-time items.\nThomas Szkutak: In fulfillment and G&A \u2013\nHeath Terry: Yes.\nThomas Szkutak: No, not really. I think it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re seeing certainly \u2013 we gave a wide range of guidance. We were in the upper end of the guidance range. And we\u2019ve got decent leverage on our operating costs as a result.\nHeath Terry: And in terms of the utilization of your Fulfillment synergy, you\u2019ve invested a lot lately. How much incremental investment do you need there? Is it something that you need to spend less on versus previous years or more? And I\u2019m not \u2013\nThomas Szkutak: I appreciate it. We did not give total year guidance, and we just gave Q1 guidance. So in terms of moving forward, there is not a lot I can talk to there. And again the reason why we didn\u2019t give guidance is because of the uncertainty in macro environment.\nHeath Terry: Fair enough. Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question will come from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: Great. Thank you for taking a further question from me. It relates to the accounts payable. It looks like your accounts payable days increased from 57 to 62 year-on-year. There\u2019s obviously been a lot of anecdotes about working capital tightness among suppliers. I wonder if you could talk about whether achieving the increase in accounts payable days in this environment was unusually challenging or not, given I assume (inaudible) big well-capitalized buyers. Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: We work with our suppliers for our overall terms. The payment terms happen to be just one piece of that. And we continue to work and partner with those suppliers. That was really the result of a lot of work that happened throughout the year and Q4. There is not a lot more beyond that I could comment.\nHeath Terry: Thank you.\nOperator: And that would conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the program back to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.\nRob Eldridge: Thank you for joining us on the call today and your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you.\nJeff Bezos: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for your participation. And you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-10-23 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com third quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead.\nRob Eldridge: Hello and welcome to our Q308 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, October 22, 2008 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2007 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today\u2019s call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 21% to $970 million. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 448 million shares compared with 435 million. Return on invested capital was 32%, down from 42%. Worldwide revenue grew 31% to $4.26 billion, or 28% excluding the $80 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. In Q3 2007, worldwide revenue benefited by approximately 290 basis points of year-over-year growth from Harry Potter 7 sales plus attachments. Excluding Harry Potter 7 plus attachments and changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue growth was 31%. Media revenue increased to $2.49 billion, up 19%, or 17% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $1.64 billion, up 52% or 49% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 38% of worldwide sales, up from 33%. Worldwide unit growth was 30% or 32% excluding Harry Potter 7 plus attachments. Prime membership increased more than 70% from the prior year and Amazon premium, the French version of Amazon Prime, launched on October 1st. We expect more customers to save time and money by using Amazon Prime to ship their gifts to friends and family this holiday season. Active customer accounts exceeded 84 million, up 17%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.4 million, up 17%. Seller units were 31% of total units, unchanged from the prior year. Worldwide gross profit was $999 million, up 31%. We recently lowered the free shipping threshold from 15 pounds to 5 pounds in the U.K. Super Save shipping is an important component of our overall value we provide and customers have save more than $700 million with our free shipping offers over the past 12 months. Now I\u2019ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing and technology and content and G&A combined was $768 million, or 18% of sales, up 8 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $378 million, or 8.9% of revenue, compared with 8.7%. We opened new fulfillment centers in Arizona, Indiana, and Pennsylvania to support continued expansion of selection and customer demand. Technology and content was $226 million, or 5.3% of revenue compared with 5.6%. Now I\u2019ll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments for stock-based compensation or other operating expense. In the North America segment, revenue grew 29% to $2.3 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $1.25 billion. Kindle selection continues to grow. Since inception, we have more than doubled the number of books, magazines, newspapers, and blogs available to be delivered wirelessly in less than one minute. Kindle titles already account for more than 10% of unit sales for books that are available in both digital and print formats. We\u2019ve ramped up manufacturing capacity over the past 10 months and Kindles are in stock and available for immediate shipment. Kindle sales since launch have significantly exceeded our expectations. We will not introduce the new version of the Kindle until next year at the earliest. EGM revenue grew 51% to $950 million, representing 41% of North America revenues, up from 35%. North American gross profit grew 28% to $586 million and gross margin decreased 24 basis points to 25.5%, driven by lower prices for our customers, including free shipping offers in Amazon Prime, and changes in product mix, partially offset by higher other revenue. North America segment operating income increased 12% to $88 million, a 3.8% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 33% to $1.96 billion. Revenue growth was 28%, adjusting for the $80 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 24% to $1.25 billion, or 18% excluding FX, and EGM grew 54% to $690 million, or 48% excluding FX. EGM now represents 35% of international revenues, up from 30%. International gross profit grew 37% to $413 million, or grew 32% excluding FX, while gross margin increased 53 basis points to 21.1%, driven by increases in 3P, product sales, and improvements in vendor pricing, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. International segment operating income increased 46% to $143 million, a 7.3% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from FX, international segment operating income increased 39%. CSOI grew 31% to $231 million, or 5.4% of revenue, unchanged year over year. Excluding the $5 million favorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 28%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 26% to $154 million, or 3.6% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $59 million in Q3, or a 33% rate for the quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 28% and that cash taxes paid will be less than $75 million. However, there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and business acquisitions or investments. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. GAAP net income was $118 million, or $0.27 per diluted share compared with $80 million and $0.19 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $416 million to $2.32 billion year over year. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consists of cash, government agency securities, triple A rated money market funds, and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. Inventory increased 36% to $1.32 billion and inventory turns were 12.4, unchanged from the prior year, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 34% to $2.24 billion and accounts payable days increased to 63 from 62 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $240 million from a year ago to $731 million. Our Q3 2008 capital expenditures were $102 million. During the quarter, approximately $132 million in principal amount of our 4.75 convertible subordinated notes converted into 1.7 million shares of common stock and we redeemed for cash the remaining total of $266 million in principal amount of the notes. I will conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. We experienced slower rates of growth towards the end of the third quarter, coinciding with disruptions in the global financial markets. While guidance takes into account these growth rates, our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in our more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our Euro denominated debt to market quarterly, intra-company balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material affect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q4, we expect net sales of between $6 billion and $7 billion, a growth of between 6% and 23%. This guidance anticipates greater than 500 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $145 million and $305 million, or between 46% decline and 13% growth. This includes approximately $85 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $230 million and $390 million, or between 30% decline and 19% growth. For the calendar year 2008, we expect net sales of between $18.46 billion and $19.46 billion, a growth of between 24% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $716 million and $876 million, or between 9% growth and 34% growth. These amounts include the impact of the $53 million non-cash gain recognized in the second quarter of 2008 on the sale of the company\u2019s European DVD rental assets. This includes approximately $300 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $964 million and $1.124 billion, or between 13% growth and 32% growth. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability, including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks and with that, Rob, let\u2019s move to questions.\nRob Eldridge: Great, thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: Thank you very much for taking my question. It looked like your third quarter margin was better than your guidance, despite the new fulfillment centers, whereas for the fourth quarter, you are guiding for margins to be flat to down year-on-year. Is that a delta going into the fourth quarter primarily because you anticipate cutting prices to sustain sales growth, or is there anything else that is going into the margin evolution?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Well, the guidance that we\u2019ve given, we gave a relatively wide range of guidance that we believe to be appropriately conservative and prudent certainly in this environment, and so it depends on really where you look at the range. You know, you see also a fairly sizable range on the operating margins as well on the bottom but it reflects again both the wide range and also the fact that our -- implicit in the assumptions that we gave for Q4, certainly a sizable change from currency as well, which is impact both the top and the bottom.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Doug Anmuth with Barclays Capital.\nDoug Anmuth: Can you tell us what you are seeing in terms of early discounting from your competitors as we go towards the holidays? And what level of discounting does the midpoint of your CSOI guidance imply relative to last holiday season? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: You know, we operate in a very competitive environment. That\u2019s not something that\u2019s new. We have competitors offline, you know, as you go to your home or office, you drive by or walk by those every day. We have certainly a number of online competitors as well, so we have -- we are very used to operating in a very competitive environment and we\u2019ve been very successful at making sure that we have great prices for customers in this environment and that\u2019s not something that is new. That is something that we have been dealing with for many years, and so it is certainly hard to predict what will happen over the course of any given quarter but what we think will happen is reflected in the guidance that we have given today.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus.\nScott Devitt: Thank you. Two questions, if I could -- first in terms of the gross and operating margin by region, the domestic margin continues to go down and international go up and your third party units have been sustained at about 31% of total. So I\u2019m just wondering if the margin impact is driven by the mix shift, where the U.S. business first party\u2019s growing faster than third and third party faster than first international. And then secondly, could you give either a number or the impact that you had implied in fourth quarter guidance for currency when you gave guidance on the third quarter call for the implied fourth quarter guidance?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Your questions on margins to start with, those were operating margins or --\nScott Devitt: Well, both but I guess maybe just looking at gross margin, because --\nThomas J. Szkutak: You were cutting out, so operating?\nScott Devitt: It would be gross margin.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Okay. You know, certainly you are seeing -- just think about it from an opportunity standpoint. We have more room to certainly -- or more opportunity certainly in our international segment as you look at our gross margins. That\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been talking about for quite some time. You know, there\u2019s a number of factors there. Certainly we had a lot more newer categories over the past few years then in North America, although we are adding categories in both segments and selection dramatically in both segments. So you have a number of factors but certainly we are earlier in third party and international, as well as the category mix in terms of where we are from a geography standpoint and our ability to get better prices with supplies has improved, so those are factors that are certainly impacting our international segment. In terms of the exchange guidance, we obviously didn\u2019t give [inaudible] implied, we didn\u2019t give guidance for Q4 last time. We gave guidance for Q3 and the total year but I think this will be helpful. Basically if you take the top end of the range, the $20.1 billion that we gave last time for revenue, right now we are talking just under 19.5, 19.463, so that\u2019s a little over $600 million. We said that last time that the total year would be more than 400 basis points of favorable impact from exchange. Now we are saying approximately 100 basis points. In dollar terms, that\u2019s approximately $500 million and so -- and the bulk of that more than $400 million is in Q4, from a change from last time, if that\u2019s helpful. The remainder is in Q3. If you\u2019ll remember, we said approximately 450 basis points for Q3 for exchange. That came in approximately 240 roughly, so that\u2019s the delta, if that helps.\nScott Devitt: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Mark Mahaney with Citigroup.\nMark Mahaney: A couple of quick questions -- that was a very significant increase in headcounts this quarter, more than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Was there something new about where those people are being deployed? Secondly, you made a comment about seeing some disruptions at the end of the third quarter from some of the -- some of the economic dislocations. Did you see that continue into the December quarter? And then the final question has to do at the very high end of your range, your guidance range in Q4, if you adjust for FX implies very little deceleration on a much tougher organic revenue comp. So I guess the question is are you seeing something that -- what would allow you to actually do something like 28% organic revenue growth? Are there new categories, new international launches that could allow you to get to the high-end of the range in a really troubling market with a tough comp? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: I\u2019m sorry, could you just repeat the first part of the question, Mark?\nMark Mahaney: A lot of new employees, 2100 new employees added in the quarter. That\u2019s a lot more than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Any new place for deployment of those employees?\nThomas J. Szkutak: The vast majority of those employees, a very high percentage of those, are in operations and customer service as we get ready for Q4. In some of my opening remarks, you also heard me talk about we opened three new fulfillment centers and certainly that\u2019s part of that increase, so again a very high percentage of that is again ops and CS related. In terms of the guidance, you mentioned the upper end. You know, we gave a pretty wide range of guidance. We think that that\u2019s prudent during this -- you know, when the environment is uncertain and it\u2019s -- and we have limited visibility as all companies have in this environment, so we think that that\u2019s appropriate. But again, certainly the upper end of guidance, if you look at our Q3, we saw very solid growth, 31% on a dollar basis, 28% excluding exchange. Keep in mind that we are overlapping Harry Potter 7 from last year. The impact that we mentioned last year was approximately 290 basis points, so if you back that out it rounds to 31% growth excluding Harry Potter and foreign exchange rates. And you know, we think we are relatively well-positioned. We\u2019ve been working very hard for years on making sure that we have a great experience with customers. We are trying to make Q4 even better than last year. We think we are well-positioned to do that. We have added a lot of selection and we have worked very hard at pricing. We have not only our free shipping offers around the world but certainly Prime has grown a lot since last Q4, so we are very optimistic from a customer experience standpoint and we will have to see where that ends up from a revenue perspective and that\u2019s why we are giving the wide range that we have given today.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Tom.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Thank you. In September, can you talk about the fundamentals -- you did see some softness. Was it customers, units? I imagine also ASPs on the currency but any detail on that. And then secondly, some nice metrics on the Kindle. As books go more digital and you hopefully can capitalize on the Kindle, does that help Amazon's long-term profitability or hurt it? How do you look at that over a long-term basis?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of what we have seen, you know, I talked about currency. Currency moved a lot, as part of the disruption in the financial markets towards the end of the quarter, through the quarter and towards the end of the quarter and obviously much more recently as well. And in terms of -- we certainly saw some slowness of growth in areas as you would expect with the disruptions in the financial markets. You know, one data point certainly we saw a deceleration of growth in purchase items over $1,000, and so that\u2019s really one item that we saw. But again, what we\u2019ve seen is factored into the guidance that we have given and as I mentioned, because of our model and because we have worked very hard at not only having low prices and affording low prices but knowing where we are relative to others, we think that that positions us very well in this environment. It positions us well in up environments, you know, customers want great values in good environments but they want especially good prices in this environment, you know, the macro environment that we are under today. So again, hard to tell, which is why the range that we\u2019ve given for guidance, where we will end up but we think we are positioned very well.\nJustin Post: And then on the Kindle? How do you see that affecting your long-term profitability in the book segment?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: Well, one thing that I think you could imagine happening over the long-term there is that the prices of books will be cheaper, so most of the books that we are offering on Kindle today are $9.99, even if they are $20 or $25 in print form. And so you can see that -- I think that probably the best way to answer your question is we would hope to sell many more units and make less money per unit but all in, have a very strong business.\nJustin Post: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: A couple of questions -- first of all, Jeff, can you characterize what you are seeing in this downturn or kind of issues in the marketplace or spending habits compares to what you saw maybe Q3, early Q4 back in 2000 when the bubble burst, just as a basis of comparison, how would you characterize it? Second, your operating margins, consolidated segment operating margins are down sequentially in Q4 when typically you get the effects or economies of scale advantage on your side. I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out, understandable that your FX is going against -- the FX is going against you but it seems like you should be seeing your costs come down a bit, at least from an international standpoint. Is there something else going on in the number, your plan to kind of keep spending up as it relates to marketing or just overhead and fulfillment that\u2019s going to be the drain from a margin standpoint as you look at Q4 relative to Q3? Thanks.\nJeffrey P. Bezos: On the first part of your question, relative to 2001, it\u2019s a very difficult question to answer in large part because Amazon has changed so much in that intervening time period. We have so many more product categories now than we did then. The scale of the business is very different, the operating efficiency of the business is very different. We have spent a lot of time and hard work reducing defects at the root so that we can have lower operating costs and pass on lower prices to customers. I love our position today in the marketplace because we have been spending so much time making sure we are the low-cost provide and that is a -- you know, something that is likely to be appealing to people in this kind of economy. So not only low cost but also -- low cost on part prices but matching that with free shipping. So it\u2019s difficult to make that comparison. If you go back in time, we were able to find back then certain segments of our business which were impacted, they were very technology related, like computer books and investing in business books and so on. Our business is now so much more diversified across product categories, although as Tom mentioned we have seen deceleration in items, for example, of above $1,000. So I guess I would leave it at that -- very difficult to make crisp comparisons relative to that time period.\nJeetil Patel: What about customer behavior wise?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: And in terms of your operating margin question in terms of looking at it sequentially, as you see from the guidance, the implied operating margins would have at the higher end being sequentially up and on the lower end, down. And certainly when you plan for the seasonal quarter you plan for a peak. We are getting ready certainly for what we hope to be a strong quarter. We think we are well-positioned for that and having facilities and associated structure to support that, and so that is what we are trying to do, trying to make sure that we support it. So if we are at the lower end of guidance, we\u2019ll have certainly some of the costs but not the revenue to support that. But again, we think we are well-positioned for Q4.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Brian Pitz with Banc of America Securities.\nBrian Pitz: Thanks. We\u2019ve seen third-party data suggesting that your share increase in the large TV market has continued to do very well. We are wondering if you expect the move to digital broadcasting by February to accelerate TV and related sales in Q4 and Q1. And then separately, would you provide any additional color on the growth in advertising related revenue to your business? Thanks.\nJeffrey P. Bezos: You know, it\u2019s really hard to say on the TV side. What I would say though is like the comment we made on across the business, we are going to make sure that we have great prices and that is something that we have been doing. And we do have great selection in that area that you are referring to in terms of the large TVs, so we are certainly a -- we should be in the customers\u2019 consideration set, given the service that we provide and the selection and the prices. So I think that\u2019s -- in terms of what will happen related to next year is difficult to say.\nBrian Pitz: And then just on advertising, any comments?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: I would say historically, our primary means of driving demand has been to focus on what we consider to be the  primary customer experience drivers -- low prices, free shipping, selection, speedy delivery, and we are going to continue. We think that\u2019s likely to continue to be the best way to drive demand in our business.\nBrian Pitz: Great, thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jeffrey Lindsay of Sanford Bernstein.\nJeffrey Lindsay: Would you be able to give us some insights as to your plans for the payments business and how fast do you see that moving ahead? Do you think it is going to be a meaningful contributor to growth or margins going forward? And if so, what time scale? And then also, could you just give us an indication -- when you make electronic sales of media, are they completely cannibalistic to your traditional media sales or are they additive? Thank you.\nJeffrey P. Bezos: So far what we have seen with the Kindle book units is that they are additive to physical book units. So when somebody buys a Kindle and the period after, you know sort of the post purchase period post buying a Kindle, they buy 1.6 times as many Kindle books as they bought physical books prior to buying a Kindle, and they continue to buy the same number of physical books. So that\u2019s what we have seen so far and it\u2019s a very -- obviously a very positive outcome. We hope that continues.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Imran Khan from J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan: Thank you for taking my questions. One key question is if this recession lasts longer than many of us would like it to, a lot of companies are talking about cost containment. As you look out over the next 18 to 24 months, how are you thinking about managing your cost over the next 18 to 24 months? Do you think you will continue to invest in the business or do you think if there is a recession, you will contain some costs?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: Our thinking is that we are going to continue to invest in the business but we are going to be especially prudent in how we make those investments. We just think that\u2019s sensible in the context of this macro environment. And let me answer the payments question from the prior caller who I forgot to answer, but the -- basically we have a couple of services today, external payment services. One call the flexible payment service, checkout by Amazon, simple pay. Those are the three primary ones. And these things are new offerings. The flexible payment service is designed for software developers to be able to design and build their own payment services, or to deeply integrate payments into whatever application they happen to be building and it has a sophisticated and a very well thought through set of APIs that enable great flexibility. Checkout by Amazon and Simple Pay are for merchants on third-party websites to be able to incorporate Amazon payments into their websites so that their customers can use their Amazon credentials when checking out. These are new seeds that we\u2019ve planted and the question was what kind of time line might those businesses become meaningful, and that\u2019s very difficult to say. We would keep working at those businesses and hope that over time, they would become meaningful.\nThomas J. Szkutak: And just to add on to Jeff\u2019s previous answer related to the next 18 to 24 months, and you were -- from a program perspective, keep in mind that we have been operating in an environment of challenging prices, a very competitive environment for some time. We have also been operating in an environment where we have been offering free shipping, for example, while fuel prices have been going up dramatically. These are things that are not new to us and so in addition to the programs and being prudent, we are going to continue to work on defect reduction, which will help us from a cost structure standpoint, continue to work on other things to make our overall cost structure improved over time.\nImran Khan: Can I ask one more question? I was going to ask, you know, you talked about the weakness in the overall business. Could you give us maybe more color into that -- what kind of trends are you seeing in the U.K. market?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I don\u2019t have a lot to add to the U.K. but again on the total business, we are actually very pleased with what we saw in Q3. You know, in a -- we think in a relatively challenging environment, we think 31% growth on a dollar basis, 28% excluding exchange and 31% excluding exchange and Harry Potter is relatively strong. And we think that we are well-positioned for customers and the environment that we are in during Q4 and we are getting ready right now for that seasonal time.\nImran Khan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question will come from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: I apologize for taking two questions but I guess my question was just once again, you have dramatically broadened the revenue range you are guiding to for the fourth quarter this year versus a much narrower range, for example, in the fourth quarter last year and I fully understand that the world is a different place today, unfortunately, from what it was then. But does the broader revenue range purely reflect greater uncertainty about constant currency spending by consumers, or are you effectively building in some headwind or tail room for further FX moves, given how volatile the currencies have been the last few weeks?\nThomas J. Szkutak: It reflects a broad range of items and as I mentioned earlier, we have -- all companies have limited visibility we think right now and we are no different, and so we are putting together what we believe to be appropriately conservative guidance. It is a wider range than we have given before, both in dollar terms and percentage terms. We think that is prudent in this environment and again, we are going to focus on what we do best, which is satisfying customers and we think we are well-positioned to do that, so that\u2019s what we plan on doing.\nJames Mitchell: Could I ask a super-quick follow-on question? It looks like you\u2019ve cast the super saver delivery charge in the U.K. from 15 pounds to 5 pounds. Do you see yourself stimulating growth globally through lower shipping costs this Christmas, and is that part of what is going into your margin consideration?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: We reduced the Super Saver delivery threshold from 15 pounds to 5 pounds, so you now in the U.K. only have to order 5 pounds or more of items to get the Super Saver delivery. And basically we did that because from a cost structure point of view, we were in a position to do it. So you should think of that as an example of us doing the kinds of things you have seen us do over the last 10 years, which is try to figure out how to lower prices and then to lower prices.\nJames Mitchell: Great. Thank you very much.\nRob Eldridge: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at last through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a good day."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-07-23 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com second quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge; please go ahead.\nRob Eldridge: Hello and welcome to our Q2 2008 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Thomas Szkutak, our CFO. Jeffrey Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, July 23, 2008 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today\u2019s call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our Investor Relations website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally unless otherwise stated all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007. Now with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Thomas.\nThomas Szkutak: Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 16% to $816 million. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 446 million shares compared with 435 million. Return on invested capital was 29%, down from 39%. Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $4.06 billion, or 35% excluding the $182 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. Media revenue increased to $2.41 billion, up 31%, or 25% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $1.53 billion, up 58% or 52% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 38% of worldwide sales, up from 34%. Worldwide unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded $81 million, up 18%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $1.4 million, up 18%. Seller units were 29% of total units, unchanged from the prior year. Worldwide gross profit was $967 million, up 38%. Now I\u2019ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $722 million, or 17.8% of sales, an improvement of 83 basis points year-over-year. Tech and content was $218 million, or 5.4% of revenue compared with 6.1%. Now I\u2019ll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment revenue grew 35% to $2.17 billion. Media revenue grew 25% to $1.15 billion. EGM revenue grew 52% to $920 million representing 42% of North America revenues, up from 38%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and baby, consumables, and soft goods, which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes, and sporting goods. North America gross profit grew 29% to $559 million and gross margin decreased 129 basis points to 25.8% driven by changes in product mix and lower prices for our customers including free shipping offers at Amazon Prime. North America segment operating income increased 17% to $96 million, a 4.4% operating margin. In the international segment revenue grew 47% to $1.89 billion. Revenue growth was 34% adjusted for the $179 million year-over-year favorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 38% to $1.26 billion, or 25% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 68% to $611 million, or 52% excluding FX. EGM now represents 32% of international revenues, up from 28%. International gross profit grew 52% to $408 million, or grew 38% excluding foreign exchange rates, while gross margin increased 66 basis points to 21.5% driven by increases in [three p] product sales, improvements in vendor pricing and higher other revenue partially offset by lower prices to our customers and changes in product mix. International segment operating income increased 80% to $149 million, a 7.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 56%. Consolidated segment operating income grew 49% to $245 million, or 6% of revenue, up 31 basis points. Excluding the $17 million favorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 38%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 86% to $217 million, or 5.3% of net sales. Included in the second quarter 2008 GAAP operating income is a $53 million non-cash gain recognized on the sale of our European DVD rental assets. Our income tax expense was $46 million in Q2 or a 22% rate for the quarter. We estimate that our effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 28% and that cash taxes paid will be less than $75 million. However there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and the business acquisitions or investments. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. GAAP net income was $158 million, or $0.37 per diluted share compared with $78 million and $0.19 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $789 million to $2.63 billion year-over-year. Inventory increased 51% to $1.11 billion and inventory turns improved to 13, up from 12.9 in the prior year even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 52% to $1.96 billion and accounts payable days increased to 58 from 54 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $208 million from a year ago to $651 million. On a trailing 12 month basis capital expenditures increased $78 million, up 40% year-over-year. Our Q2 2008 capital expenditures were $69 million. During the quarter approximately $473 million in principal amount of our four-and-three-quarter convertible subordinated notes converted into 6.1 million shares of common stock and we redeemed $27 million from principal amount of the notes. I\u2019ll conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our euro denominated debt to market quarterly, intra-company balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material affect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q3 we expect net sales of between $4.2 billion and $4.425 billion, a growth of between 29% and 36%. This guidance anticipates approximately 450 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $115 million and $160 million, or between 6% decline and 31% growth. This includes approximately $80 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $195 million and $240 million, or between 10% growth and 36% growth. For calendar year 2008, we expect net sales of between $19.35 billion and $20.1 billion, a growth between 30% and 35%. This guidance anticipates greater than 400 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. Our GAAP operating income to be between $745 million and $920 million, or between 14% growth and 40% growth. This includes approximately $295 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $1.040 billion and $1.215 billion, or between 22% growth and 43% growth. Our goal continues to be operating leverage in 2008, with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development costs to be approximately $325 million. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. Thanks and with that let\u2019s move to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney \u2013 Citigroup\nMark Mahaney: I wanted to ask about some of the digital media offerings, are there any data points, it\u2019s a highly competitive space, music, video and now e-readers online, particularly the first two, what are the data points that you look at to judge how well you\u2019re doing in that segment? Anything you can share with us and then any comment at all on the kindle and what kind of\u2014how many units you\u2019ve sold or any kind of demand metrics there?\nJeffrey Bezos: We don\u2019t really breakout those digital figures. What I can tell you on kindle is that we\u2019re not releasing the number of units of kindle that we\u2019ve sold, the number of devices, what we have said is that we are, if you look at the universe of titles where we saw the kindle version, so those 140,000 different titles, the percentage of all-in units that in kindle unit form versus their physical book equivalent for that same universe is low double-digits at this point, which we\u2019re very excited about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post \u2013 Merrill Lynch\nJustin Post: It looks like for several quarters now third party units were growing faster then your own units, it looks like it was kind of flat this quarter, are there any changes there? And as you look forward it looks like margins might be slightly lower operating income margins going forward, is that trajectory affecting your margin outlook as you look out to the back half?\nThomas Szkutak: To answer your first question third party units [or] the percentage of total units was 29% which is flat with last year. Keep in mind that our unit growth did accelerate in total so our unit growth was 32%. Also keep in mind or another data point is our third party units did grow faster then our retail units this quarter. So again, we\u2019re still seeing very, very good growth there. A couple of things to think about the active seller accounts if you will, are up 18% year-over-year that compares to a year ago where they\u2019re up 11%. We\u2019ve had several quarters where we\u2019ve seen accelerated growth of active seller accounts. So again we think that the business looks good. It\u2019s really not impacting the guidance as we think about it. We\u2019re very positive about both our retail business and our third party business. Ultimately the customer will decide what units they buy and we\u2019re trying to make the experience better for customers and for sellers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Joseph - Morgan Stanley\nDavid Joseph: On that point of unit growth, so it seemed like it accelerated while gross margin actually declined year-over-year, so it seems that Amazon might be getting a little bit aggressive on pricing. I\u2019m wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit more color on that and then just really a math question, excluding the sale of an asset for $45 million operating margin ex dot com according to our math would have come in line with our estimate of about 6.0%, is that correct?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of pricing we\u2019ve been pretty consistent. We\u2019re trying to make sure we have very competitive pricing across many different categories and many different geographies and so we\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to make sure that that is the case and we\u2019re always looking for ways to improve that to make sure we have the most, the best information as we do that. So that, in terms of a process standpoint, nothing has really changed there. In terms of your question on the gain the gain was, the $53 million gain was not included in our guidance, it\u2019s included in our GAAP operating income. It\u2019s not included in our CSOI so if you look at our CSOI of $245 million, it\u2019s not included in that number. So again, the range we gave for CSOI for Q2 was $200 million to $240 million; we came in at $245 million. The $245 million does not include the gain.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeetil Patel \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nJeetil Patel: It seems like the flywheel is working internationally, if you look at third party and Prime, it looks like your kind of getting the similar lift that you got in the US as you had the Prime service ramp up. I guess if you could frame for us where international stands in terms of the ramp phase relative to going back in the North American market where timeframe revolution, where international looks today with third party and Prime versus domestically. And then second is there a way for you to leverage your customer buying relationships with consumers in your technology platform to basically go after other retailing opportunities. I guess I\u2019m trying to allude to Universal Wish List and how that fits in and maybe even a Universal payment service from an affiliate standpoint how that fits into the grand scheme of things.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the first part of the question regarding third party and Prime its difficult to give a timeframe but I would say on both its certainly earlier for both, so both in terms of our third party as well as Prime in terms of penetration. And that\u2019s really because we\u2019ve been at it longer in North America. We like the progress that we\u2019re making in both accounts in North America and international but its earlier as you\u2019d expect. Could you just repeat the second part of your question?\nJeetil Patel: I\u2019m just trying to understand how your customer buying relationships with over 80 million customers and your technology that you\u2019ve been building out for years now, just how does an idea like Universal Wish List, which I think is available on the site or payments fit into that. How do you take your existing assets and how do those fit into that?\nJeffrey Bezos: In the case of Universal Wish List we have a very large number of folks using the Amazon Wish List and we have for a number of years and so that\u2019s a\u2014basically a thriving feature and the idea behind Universal Wish List is that, its really just a customer service that as people go about their business on the web, if they would like to add something to their wish list from another vendor on another website we make it very easy for them to do that. So then they have still one place to point their friends and relatives to, to see their Universal Wish List.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs\nJames Mitchell: Could you talk a little bit about your third quarter operating income guidance, I think in 2007 your operating income ticked up a little quarter-on-quarter from 2Q to 3Q and for this year you\u2019re guiding for it to tick down a little, I wondered if that was due to just general corporate conservatism or whether there was any specific driver?\nThomas Szkutak: The only thing I\u2019d call out is and we have announced a number of capacity increases and fulfillment and certainly with the large growth that we\u2019ve seen, you\u2019re seeing\u2014you saw leverage in Q1 and Q2 on our fulfillment expense as a percentage of revenue. With the added capacity it\u2019s a little bit lumpy in Q3 but we\u2019re adding additional capacity to serve Q4. It is typical that we do it in Q3, we also do it in other quarters but it\u2019s just a little bit lumpy in Q3 and certainly reflected in the guidance that we\u2019ve given for Q3.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Pitz \u2013 Banc of America Securities\nBrian Pitz: First a question on taxes, would you comment on any changes in demand from New York State customers given the recent collection of sales taxes there and then a separate question on gross margins, a gap remains between North America and international gross margins, can you talk about the key leverage points that will help to close the gap there?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of New York, its really too early to comment there but I just want to remind everyone that we really collect either sales tax or value-added tax on approximately 50% of our business today and we collect at a number of states in the US, we collect in a number of the geographies outside of the US and so we have very good businesses in those geographies. In terms of your gross margin question, you\u2019re absolutely right; we do have a delta between our North America and international business. A couple of the dynamics there, one of them which we talked about a little bit earlier, certainly our third party penetration is higher in North America then it is in international, and so that\u2019s an opportunity for us. Certainly as we get the scale we\u2019ve launched many, many new categories in international over the past 18 months and as those categories get more and more to scale, there\u2019s opportunities on the margin side there. And so those are certainly the key ones in terms of differences.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford C. Bernstein\nJeffrey Lindsay: What is the impact on your delivery and fulfillment charges particularly with regard to Prime, of increased transportation costs, is this really a 2009 phenomenon for you or is there a possible increase in delivery cost coming through the pipeline? And then could you just give us a comment on how you\u2019re seeing any impact from consumer confidence on sales, product mix, sales frequency, smaller ticket items, are you seeing any difference now that consumer confidence is significantly lower?\nJeffrey Bezos: On the fuel prices we suspect that higher fuel prices may be a relative advantage for us both in terms of relative to physical world stores because of the expense of driving to a store, even just driving 10  miles these days is a few dollars worth of gasoline and consumers we suspect are beginning to take that into account and think about that and try to do trip consolidation and so certainly our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime become very high, a clearly of even more value to customers under that set of circumstances. And then relative to other online retailers because of our scale we have a distributed fulfillment center network that places products closer to customers that allows us to do fast transportation to customers, fast deliveries to customers but usually using ground transportation instead of air transportation and ground transportation is much more fuel efficient then air transportation. So probably this is a relative advantage for Amazon and its our job to insulate customers since we offer free shipping and Amazon Prime offers fast free shipping, the burden is upon us to make sure that we can do that in a way that is economical for us so that customers can continue to enjoy those free shipping offers and we have clearly no intention of changing those. We\u2019ll keep them in place.\nJeffrey Lindsay: Do you think it will impact your margins negatively going forward?\nThomas Szkutak: This is something that we\u2019ve been dealing with for quite some time, as part of our overall cost structure. We started in the US some of the free shipping offers back in 2002 I believe. Oil prices were around $22.00 a barrel back in 2002. They\u2019ve continued to grow and certainly it is more costly but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s really new to us. Its part of our overall thinking as we look at our costs.\nJeffrey Lindsay: Are you seeing any change in consumer buying habits because of the lower consumer confidence?\nThomas Szkutak: We\u2019re probably not the best bell weather for the economy and certainly one indication of that is just looking at our overall growth rates that you see for Q2. We have growth rates of 35% excluding the impact of the exchange that accelerated from last year where we saw a little bit under 33% excluding exchange and also an acceleration from Q1. So I don\u2019t think I can really help.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus\nScott Devitt: As it relates to the guidance and the change for the guidance last quarter you gave full year GAAP Op In guidance $740 to $940 and the GAAP operating income this quarter was I believe $57 million above expectations including the $53 million gain so I\u2019m trying to get my hands around the updated guidance which is mostly unchanged from the prior GAAP operating income guidance and whether this new guidance includes or excludes the $53 million gain.\nThomas Szkutak: Yes, the GAAP, the guidance excludes the $53 million gain.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers\nDoug Anmuth: On CapEx it looks like you raised your outlook by about $25 million so CapEx is now expected to be up about 46% year-over-year, can you talk about why the increase there and then can you detail the contribution from audible during the quarter?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the CapEx the increase, we spent CapEx in a number of different areas, certainly a big portion of it is fulfillment related also infrastructure related and then a few other smaller areas and so those are really the drivers for the CapEx growth, not only the increase from $300 to $325 but also the increase year-over-year. So really it relates back to the growth of the business which is causing that increase.\nDoug Anmuth: And the audible contribution?\nThomas Szkutak: We\u2019re not breaking out the audible piece in our results for Q2.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Weinstein \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities\nSteve Weinstein: If we want to back out the $53 million gain for the sale of the DVD business what would the offsetting tax impact be for that?\nThomas Szkutak: I can\u2019t talk to the tax piece, I guess the best way to say it is the estimate for the year is 28% and you see a first half effective tax rate of 26% and that gain is reflected in the first half results in the 26% effective tax rate. Again our estimate for the year is 28%.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Imran Khan \u2013 JP Morgan\nImran Khan: One of the biggest value propositions for your biggest consumer business in price discount and free shipping and things like that, as 30% of your business is now coming the sellers business how do you ensure the quality, the security and the safety that the consumer gets from your main business. The free cash flow growth rate was 16% versus 51% and I can understand that can fluctuate quarter-over-quarter and how should we think about the full year free cash flow growth rate?\nJeffrey Bezos: For your first question the first way we do that is because we have an astonishingly good group of sellers who take their customer experience and the customer service that they provide on Amazon very, very seriously, and we give them lots of metrics and tools to help them manage that experience. So that\u2019s sort of the first answer to your question is the sellers do a very good job. Some better then others and we try to make it very clear both to the sellers and to the consumers the quality of that particular seller. The second thing is that we are more and more having sellers take advantage of fulfillment by Amazon which is a program that lets sellers put their inventory in our fulfillment centers. This is a very big advantage for sellers because it increases their sales. When sellers move into fulfillment by Amazon they end up selling more. The second reason it\u2019s a big advantage is it\u2019s a big advantage for the consumer because now those third party items are eligible for super saver shipping, they\u2019re eligible for Amazon Prime, a third party item can be married together and put in a box with an Amazon retail item so that the outbound transportation is more efficient. So there are a lot of advantages to fulfillment by Amazon and that\u2019s another kind of a second part to the answer for how that third party business can have a very high level of customer experience for our consumers. Your question is a very good one, its one we think about a lot and we take very seriously.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the second part of your question we\u2019re not giving guidance on annual free cash flow but just wanted to comment for a second on the Q2 growth, Q2 of last year if you go back to actually Q1 of last year we had free cash flow growth of 4%, Q2 on a trailing 12 months last year was a growth of 87% and the sequential growth was 34%. That was a difficult compare and a little bit of an anomaly compared to the last several years. If you look back over the last several year period you\u2019ll see that our sequential growth that we had this quarter from Q1 to Q2 was very consistent with what we\u2019ve seen other then that. And if you look at the underlying pieces and metrics that support free cash flow you\u2019ll see that our consolidated segment operating income over the past 12 months was up 56%, our AP days were up four days, our inventory turns were essentially flat 13 versus 12.9, and our CapEx was up 40% which was just slightly under our trailing 12 month revenue growth. So those are the underlying pieces that I think are most significant.\nRob Eldridge: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you everybody."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-04-24 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com first quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.\nRob Eldridge: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2008 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, April 23, 2008 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2007 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today\u2019s call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 51% to $788 million. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 435 million shares compared with 430 million. Return on invested capital was 32%, up from 30%. Worldwide revenue grew 37% to $4.13 billion, or 31% excluding the $185 million of favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $2.54 billion, up 28%, or 21% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $1.48 billion, up 56% or 50% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 36% of worldwide sales, up from 31%. Worldwide unit growth was 31%. Active customer accounts exceeded $79 million, up 19%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $1.3 million, up 17%. Seller units were 30% of total units versus 29%. Worldwide gross profit was $956 million, up 33%. Now I\u2019ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $698 million, or 16.9% of sales, an improvement of 103 basis points year over year. Tech and content was $203 million, or 4.9% of revenue compared with 5.5%. Now I\u2019ll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments for stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 31% to $2.13 billion. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 46% to $826 million, representing 39% of North America revenues, up from 35%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and baby, consumables, and soft goods, which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes, and sporting goods. North America gross profit grew 29% to $569 million, and gross margin decreased 33 basis points to 26.7%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 52% to $130 million, a 6.1% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 44% to $2.01 billion. Revenue growth was 31%, adjusting for the $179 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 34% to $1.34 billion, or 22% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 71% to $655 million, or 56% excluding FX. EGM now represents 33% of international revenues, up from 27%. International gross profit grew 38% to $387 million, or grew 26% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 81 basis points to 19.3%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by increases in product sales by our sellers. International segment operating income increased 36% to $128 million, a 6.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from FX, international segment operating income increased 19%. CSOI grew 44% to $258 million, or 6.2% of revenue, up 29 basis points. Excluding the $14 million favorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 36%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 36% to $198 million, or 4.8% of net sales. Our income tax was $62 million in Q1, or a 30% rate for the quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 30% and that cash taxes paid will be less than $75 million. However, there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and business acquisitions or investments. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. GAAP net income was $143 million, or $0.34 per diluted share compared with $111 million and $0.26 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $830 million to $2.4 billion year over year. Inventory increased 43% to $1.08 billion and inventory turns improved to 13.1, up from 12.9 in the prior year, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies, and introduced new product categories. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $152 million from a year ago to $594 million. Our Q1 2008 capital expenditures were $61 million. I will conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in our more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our Euro denominated debt to market quarterly, intra-company balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material affect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q2, we expect net sales of between $3.875 billion and $4.075 billion, a growth of between 34% and 41%. This guidance anticipates approximately 700 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $120 million and $160 million, or between 3% growth and 38% growth. This includes approximately $80 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $200 million and $240 million, or between 21% growth and 46% growth. For the calendar year 2008, we expect net sales of between $19.1 billion and $20 billion, a growth between 29% and 35%. This guidance anticipates greater than 400 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $740 million and $940 million, or between 13% growth and 43% growth. This includes approximately $285 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $1.025 billion and $1.225 billion, or between 21% growth and 44% growth. Our goal continues to be operating leverage in 2008, with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability, including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $300 million. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand. Thanks and with that, Rob, let\u2019s move to questions.\nRob Eldridge: Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.\nJeetil Patel: Thanks. A couple of questions; first of all, philosophically do you think your customers have a greater propensity to buy or show greater loyalty to your retail business and the third party, and I guess does that influence what the lifetime value of a customer is that is buying across let\u2019s say retail or prime versus the third party business? And then second, now that you\u2019ve rolled out internationally third party and prime, are you getting the type of incremental leverage from selection and reduced friction on the e-commerce side that you saw in the U.S. I guess over the last year and now you are seeing from an acceleration standpoint?\nJeffrey P. Bezos: I\u2019ll take the first one. I think what our customers are focused on is whether they are getting excellent service in every one of their transactions and certainly for Amazon Prime members, we\u2019ve raised the bar and offered the ability for customers to get products very, very quickly, very low cycle times, from the time they place the order until we are shipping it out our dock door and then it gets to the customer in two days for free. And what we are working to do with fulfillment by Amazon is make it possible for third party sellers to stow their inventory in our fulfillment centers so that we can offer the same level of service to our customers for those third party items that we do for the Amazon owned inventory. And we are seeing a lot of traction there. We are seeing a lot of happy sellers with fulfillment by Amazon and it is certainly great for customers, in part because they can get one box instead of two. So if they order something from Amazon and at the same time they order something from a third party seller, if we have that item in inventory we get to marry those two items together, ship them in one box. It\u2019s a better customer experience. It saves transportation costs, transportation fuel, and it just works out better. There\u2019s enough system wide cost savings that we can offer fulfillment by Amazon to the third party sellers at a very attractive price. But the driver of that program is, as with most things we do, starting with figuring out how we are going to make that customer experience great. We have this Amazon Prime customer experience. We want that to work for third-party sales and for third-party sellers.\nRob Eldridge: Could you repeat the second part of the question --\nJeetil Patel: Yeah, I mean, if you look internationally, you\u2019ve done -- you\u2019ve rolled out third-party and prime in some of the major regions over the past year. Are you starting to see that incremental leverage of both selection from your third-party side as well as the reduced friction from prime helping to drive or accelerate growth as you\u2019ve been seeing in the U.S.?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Well, certainly with the third party, you know, we\u2019ve had third party sellers in international for quite some time but we have launched some new features over the past few years with merchants at being more prominent in international. But we are very pleased with our third party sellers in international. It is certainly growing nicely, as well as the total is growing nicely. In terms of prime, we are very, very happy with what we are seeing but it is still very, very early and with a few countries just being launched a few months ago, and Japan about nine months ago, so we love what we see so far but it\u2019s very early.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Imran Khan with J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan: Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions; first, international operating income growth rate excluding foreign currency decelerate pretty significantly. I was trying to understand how should we think about international gross profit and segment operating income growth rate? And second question, in the U.S., can you give us some sense of, you know, if the U.S. economy slows and -- or continues to slow and if you see more price discounting from the other retailers, what kind of pricing you expect -- do you continue to maintain your price leadership and if so, how should we think about the gross profit dollar growth? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the international operating margins, what you are seeing is, if you take a look at it, it is really our gross margins were down year over year and what you are seeing is certainly lower prices in international was a piece of it. Also, if you just look at the mix of business, we had very, very strong growth in EGM, electronics and general merchandise. That was up 76% year over year -- excuse me, 71% year over year. Adjusted for FX it was up 56%, which is the strongest growth we\u2019ve seen in quite some time in international. And if you think about it, if you look at a lot of the category launches that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019ve had approximately 16 category launches last year, so again a lot of these newer categories are starting and we are making sure that we have great prices right away, but we certainly don\u2019t have the scale to buy yet in those particular categories. So you are seeing part of that. And then also offsetting some of those impacts of mix and pricing is certainly third parties growing at a faster rate, as well as COGS reduction. So that\u2019s really what is happening in international and we think certainly adding a lot of new categories in that opportunity both for customers and investors over a long time is a good thing and it is something that we will continue to drive. In terms of the second part, our pricing strategy is very simple. We are going to make sure we have great low prices for customers. It is hard, certainly hard to predict what will happen over the course of the year but we think we have reflected what we do think is going to happen in the guidance that we\u2019ve given today. But we are going to make sure that we have great prices and great selection and on top of that, this wasn\u2019t part of your question but you know, we think that in this type of environment externally, customers want great value and so that is both in down times and up times, and we think that that\u2019s good, and so we are going to concentrate and make sure that we have the right processes in place to make sure we have the right prices for customers.\nImran Khan: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Heath Terry with Credit Suisse.\nHeath Terry: Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the third party business in Europe, particularly with your ability to attract the larger third party partners, like Martin Spencer and of course, Target in the U.S. You mentioned that third party is 31% of overall business. That number has been pretty stable for a while, despite the launch into Europe. Can you give us an idea of what kind of impact Europe is having and if there is some kind of offset in the U.S. that is holding that number at 30%?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of our -- we haven\u2019t broken out separately the two segments but the third party business is doing very well in both segments, and so I can\u2019t help you much with the international piece, but just a few data points on our total business, which includes international. You mentioned our third party units were actually 30%, which is up from last year, Q1 of last year. Also, our active seller accounts, which includes this globally, we had 8% growth last year Q1. We have 17% growth this quarter, so we are seeing nice active seller growth, and again that\u2019s a global number. And we\u2019ve had several quarters of sequential growth, including growing from Q4. So we are seeing a lot of positives from our third party business and as Jeff mentioned a few minutes ago, some of the things we\u2019ve done with Fulfilled by Amazon is also very promising, again to try to make that experience better for both customers and sellers.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus.\nScott Devitt: Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about your digital initiatives in your international markets in terms of timing? I understood that you have certain plans within Europe in 2008 and I was wondering if you could add some clarity around that. And then separately, just a bigger picture item, your long-term ambitions with payments, the Amazon payment site is live, you\u2019ve launched flexible payments and also done an investment in bill me later, so I would be interested to understand what your longer term plans are there. Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. What we did say for international MP3, it will be sometime this year and so we don\u2019t have anything more to add to that. In terms of the second part of your question, could you repeat it? It was Scott, right, that had the question?\nScott Devitt: The second part is just around your third party payment initiatives with the Amazon payment site that allows the bank account transfers, as well as balances and the flexible payment system, which allows developers to integrate into e-commerce sites and your bill me later investment. I\u2019m trying to understand what your ambitions are with each of those platforms.\nThomas J. Szkutak: You know, certainly beyond what we have announced, we think these are very interesting initiatives. It is still very early in all of them and we think that we can offer a very good customer experience, which will be for both developers and customers ultimately and we will have to -- you\u2019ll have to stay tuned to see more on those.\nScott Devitt: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from David Joseph with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Joseph: Thank you. As you\u2019ve increased your revenue guidance for 2008, you\u2019ve also kept your operating income the same. In other words, your guidance for margin came down a little bit. Our sense is that it is a little bit more of the same, you know, lower pricing in international, stronger EGM mix, but also are there -- were there increased expectations for spending as well? Also, in terms of the economy, it sounds like you are really not -- you are not seeing anything in terms of an impact to consumer spending. I\u2019m just wondering if we can be a little bit even more granular -- if you saw anything during the quarter or even in April related to units per -- related to conversion or even units sold per customer or lower ticket sizes, maybe softness in certain categories that you may have observed that could be related to the economy. Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the first part of your question about the increase in revenue and operating income, or CSOI, being the same as what it was before, I wouldn\u2019t read much into it. It\u2019s largely unchanged from 90 days ago and -- but in terms of what we are seeing externally, you know we don\u2019t have a lot of data points on the economy. We have certainly a lot of data points on how our business is doing and as you can see from our results in Q1, revenue growth as well as operating margin -- we had strong revenue growth as well as good operating improvements year over year with operating margins up approximately 30 basis points. So that\u2019s what we have seen in Q1 and what we think will happen throughout the year has been reflected in the guidance that we gave you today.\nDavid Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeffrey Lindsay with Sanford Bernstein.\nJeffrey Lindsay: We wanted to ask and see if we can get an update if at all possible on sales taxes. Will Amazon be able to cope with collecting sales taxes if obliged to do so by the states, especially New York? And then also, if you could, could you give us any update that you can on sales of fresh groceries and wine sales. Is this still a novelty or do you expect to get any traction here?\nThomas J. Szkutak: It would be early to comment on any state activity as it relates to sales taxes, but certainly we do collect sales tax or value-added tax in the states or countries that require us to do so, and we do that activity and approaching 50% of our total business. We do collect some type of sales tax or value-added tax. And we have great businesses in those states and countries that we do do that. And the reason why we do is because we are focused on the things that matter to customers, which is making sure that we do have great prices, that we are continuing to expand selections, making sure that we have more and more products in stock and available for immediate shipment. And those are the things that matter to customers. And so that\u2019s what we are going. In terms of some of your other questions, in terms of groceries, we have really two things that we do. We have a consumable business today, which is a dry goods business that we are very pleased with. It\u2019s still very early but we think we like what we see so far. The other part is we do have small pilot going on related to fresh groceries. It\u2019s in the Seattle area here locally where we are testing groceries. But beyond that, again it\u2019s just a test that we are doing and we will see how that works out.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: A few things -- Jeff, I saw your interview on the Kindle and I could sense the company\u2019s excitement there. Any media sales, either through the Kindle or some of the stuff you are going in music of video, affecting results, either revenues or margins at all at this point? A second question -- we saw the other revenues really tick up. I think they are going close to 40%. Is that anything to do with web services? And finally, Tom, could you just remind us what your currency guidance was back in January? I believe it was 400 basis points for the year. At this point, I just want to remind us where it was when you got it in January. Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: It was 200 basis points in January and now it is 400. In terms of digital, we are extremely happy with what we are able to offer customers but certainly we have a considerable base of revenue today, so it is very, very early but we are very pleased with the traction in each of the initiatives that we have out there and apologies for not breaking it out any more detailed than that.\nJustin Post: And then on the other, what drove the growth year over year?\nThomas J. Szkutak: You know, other is a combination of a number of things, including some of our Amazon enterprise services, certainly web services would be a part of that as well, and so again there\u2019s a number of things that are included in that.\nJustin Post: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citigroup.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you. Two or three questions, please. The ROIC trend, that 32% clearly up on a year-over-year basis but since it\u2019s a trailing four or five quarters calculation, is there any particular reason why it would have lagged down from the 50% levels or materially higher for the last couple of quarters? And then secondly, just in terms of the overall revenue mix or product mix, are you seeing any trend, material trend towards purchases of staple items, consumer staple items on your site away from maybe more traditional media entertainment, consumer discretionary items? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the first part of your question related to ROIC, what you are seeing is certainly versus last quarter, free cash flow is very strong but wasn\u2019t as strong as it was on a trailing 12-month basis ended 2007, which is certainly a key driver. And a lot of that is just really seasonality associated with our business as it relates to our operating cycle, which you can see. In terms of -- can you repeat the second part of your question related to consumables?\nMark Mahaney: Are you seeing amongst the Amazon customer base a shift towards or an increasing of the basket or the bundle as people check out that includes more consumer staple items -- you know, the simple things, the toothpastes, the hair brushes, things like that? Is there something in there that indicates that the increasing wallet share is coming not just from cross-selling media consumer electronics but actually cross-selling consumer staples?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yeah, there\u2019s not really a lot I can comment on that. Again, what we are seeing though is if you look at our results, you are seeing very broad strong growth across the key sales breakouts that we have, and that\u2019s not just globally. You are seeing it in the individual segments. You are seeing strong media growth as well as EGM in both segments, and so you should be thinking about it that it\u2019s very broad.\nMark Mahaney: And then one last question; it has to do with any recessionary impact? I know you\u2019ve been kind of asked about this before but just to be clear, is your position that you are not seeing any impact from the recessionary environment in the U.S., either in terms of demand for certain categories, demand for certain price points, or that you are? And if you are, how are you seeing that impact?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Well, what we are seeing is -- you know, you could see at a -- based on the results that we\u2019ve just published in Q1, globally our revenue increased 37%. You see that in both segments excluding the impact of exchange rates, both grew faster than 30%, which is -- which we think is very strong. It was very broad, as I had mentioned. So it\u2019s difficult to say. We don\u2019t have a lot of data points around the economy, so it is difficult to say what is going on there. We are seeing what we see within our business, which is some pretty good strength across categories. And again, we think it\u2019s driven by a lot of the things that we talked about earlier. It\u2019s just making sure, continuing to have great low prices, increasing our selection, making sure that we also have in-stock levels where we want them to be. We\u2019ve been improving that a lot over the past few years, and so those are the things that are driving the growth.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks for the detail, Tom. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with Lehman Brothers.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you for taking my questions. First, media sales have been strong for some time but it looks like there has been a more material deceleration in 1Q in the U.S. Is there anything in particular that you would attribute that too? And then secondly, can you just confirm -- is Audible now a factor into the guidance? Was it factored in three months ago and how much are you expecting from Audible in \u201908? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: It is factored into our guidance. It was not factored into our guidance 90 days ago and we are not breaking out the detail of what that is for 2008. But in terms of our overall growth in media, you know, we are actually pleased with it. I mean, North America is a -- you know, it\u2019s a 20% growth -- excuse me, it was 22% growth, 21% ex FX. If you go back to Q1 last year, it was 21%. So we are still seeing strong growth in international. We also had 22% growth ex exchange. So again, it\u2019s -- we are still very pleased with the growth rates we are seeing there.\nDoug Anmuth: And Tom, can you also just provide some color on the increase in stock-based comp for the year?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. The pieces, we did increase both stock-based compensation and intangibles. Keep in mind that we did have the acquisition of Audible, and so there is a piece of that that\u2019s amortization of intangibles, which is Audible related, and there\u2019s a piece that is stock related.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Essentially it\u2019s related to forfeitures on the stock-based comp side, is the largest piece.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Aaron Kessler with Piper Jaffray.\nAaron Kessler: Just a couple of questions; first, going back to the economy, any sense -- are people changing maybe their average order sizes or any impact you are seeing on larger ticket items? And also, in terms of seasonality throughout the quarter, can you comment at all on how that may have changed? It seems like it got a little slower in March than it was in January and February, so just maybe any commentary on seasonality throughout the quarter. Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the economy, I\u2019m not sure I can add a lot more to it. We saw what we thought was strong growth in Q1. We thought it was pretty broad-based across categories and we feel good about it. Certainly 31% growth is not the growth that we saw in Q4, 31% ex exchange. It was 37% in Q4. But we are certainly overlapping some pretty good growth rates back in Q1 of last year and despite that, we actually -- if you compare our growth rate in Q1 on a dollar basis or ex exchange, we had an acceleration from Q1 of last year. And you could argue that the economic environment at least what I am reading as well as I am sure what you are reading, looks tougher. And so not as strong as Q4 but certainly stronger than we saw in Q1 last year in acceleration. Again, it\u2019s across categories so we feel good and it\u2019s broad-based.\nAaron Kessler: Just a quick follow-up; revenues seem to be growing much faster than unit growth, where they used to grow closer to in-line. Is that just due to the shift to the electronics and other category or is there another reason for that?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Could you repeat the question again?\nAaron Kessler: Revenues seem to be growing faster than unit growth over the last few quarters, where they used to grow more in-line. So is that just a shift really to the electronics and other category from more BMV?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I would look -- I would actually make sure you are taking out the impact of exchange when you look at it, because certain exchange is impacting us quite a bit. Again, our growth rate for units this quarter was 31%. Our revenue ex exchange was 31% and again, 37% on a dollar basis.\nAaron Kessler: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: Thank you very much for taking a couple of questions. First, is it reasonable to assume afar from the jump in unearned revenue that that would to some extent reflect sales of Kindles and Prime payments?\nThomas J. Szkutak: You are breaking up a little bit. Could you repeat the question again, please?\nJames Mitchell: I\u2019m sorry. If I look at the jump in unearned revenue on the unearned revenue inflows on the cash flow statement, would that reflect sales of Kindle and Prime payments increasing?\nThomas J. Szkutak: It has a number of things that would be included in that, but certainly those elements would be included in there, yes.\nJames Mitchell: Okay, and then if I look at the general and admin costs, they seem very well-controlled in the latest quarter. Should we expect that trend to broadly continue going forward? And if it does tick down from roughly 2% to roughly 1% of revenue --\nThomas J. Szkutak: You know, we -- it\u2019s been a relatively small percentage of revenue over some time and we are not giving guidance on any particular line items. I\u2019m not sure I can help you much with that one. Apologies.\nJames Mitchell: Okay, and then just finally for me on the gross margin trends, if you look internally at gross margin trends within categories, can you provide any color on whether the recent flattening in gross margins year-on-year is due more to priced reductions within categories or to category mix shift from higher gross margin to lower gross margin categories?\nThomas J. Szkutak: The way the dynamics, I guess, of thinking about gross margins, the way I would describe it would be this -- we\u2019re not breaking out individual categories but certainly we are trying to be -- make sure we are as competitive as possible, and that\u2019s on each item, and each of the categories that we have globally. And offsetting that, we certainly are continuing to try to make sure we get good COGS reductions from suppliers. You should assume that when we launch new categories that generally, those are lower gross margins. So in other words, we are trying to price our products day one competitive, but we don\u2019t have the buying ability to -- or the scale to buy at certain prices from vendors because we don\u2019t have the volume. But certainly that changes over time. And then as these individual categories get more traction, usually there\u2019s a better third party representation of those categories. So I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful. It doesn\u2019t quite answer your question but I think directionally hopefully it does.\nJames Mitchell: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Brian Pitz with Banc of America Securities.\nBrian Pitz: Thank you. In terms of your guidance, are you factoring in or do you expect any impact from the U.S. economic stimulus plan rebate? And just separately, any comments on why the Kindle remains supply constrained? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of our guidance, we factored in certainly all things that we can think of that will impact our business, you know, leading up to the call. And so we look at recent trends. We have our categories, provide forecasts of our business globally. We have a number of different models, so all of those things that we try to take into account when we give guidance.\nJeffrey P. Bezos: I can comment on the Kindle. The team here has worked incredibly hard since launch to increase the supply chain, to increase manufacturing capacity, and they have done a very good job at that. And just as of a couple of days, Kindle is where we have always wanted it to be, which is in stock. So we are very excited about that. We have worked hard to get Kindle detail page to say Availability: In Stock.\nBrian Pitz: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Steve Weinstein with Pacific Crest.\nSteve Weinstein: Great. Thank you very much. This may have been asked a lot of ways but I\u2019ll [ask one more] directly; if I look at your guidance for the full year, if I take into account the changing currency assumptions, the acquisition of Audible, and the upside of the Q1, it looks like you are guiding down revenue for the next three quarters by about 3%. And so I\u2019m wondering if that reflects any change you are seeing in the demand environment or if that reflects tactical changes that Amazon has planned for the rest of the year?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. We have certainly raised our guidance. If you look at the bottom end of the range of our guidance for revenue, it reflects certainly some changes in currency, in the acquisition that you mentioned. And I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. We still -- the most recent performance that we have is Q1 and we thought we had very strong performance, both on the revenue growth and operating profit standpoint and we feel good about the business. But based on the -- you know, our best forecast for the year, we think the guidance is appropriate.\nSteve Weinstein: Thank you.\nRob Eldridge: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect."}], "2010": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2009, "date": "2010-01-29 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 financial results conference. (Operator Instructions) For today\u2019s opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.\nRob Eldridge: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2009 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. He and I will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 28, 2010 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thanks Rob. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 114% to $2.92 billion. Return on invested capital was 66% up from 41%. ROIC is trailing TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 461 million shares compared with 446 million. Worldwide revenue grew 42% to $9.52 billion or 37% excluding the $354 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, best selection and free shipping offers including Amazon Prime. Media revenue increased to $4.68 billion, up 29% or 23% excluding FX rates. EGM revenue increased to $4.61 billion up 60% or 54% excluding FX rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 48% of worldwide sales, up from 43%. Worldwide unit growth was 37%. Active customer accounts exceeded 105 million, up 19%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.9 million, up 24%. Seller units were 28% of total units. Worldwide gross profit was $1.98 billion, up 47%. Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $1.3 billion or 14.5% of sales, down 25 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $733 million or 7.7% of revenue compared with 7.9%. Tech and content was $297 million or 3.1% of revenue compared with 3.5%. Marketing was $269 million or 2.8% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year. Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments or stock based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $4.96 billion. Zappos, which is included in our results beginning November 1, 2009 contributed approximately $200 million to our fourth quarter revenue. Media revenue grew 20% to $2.1 billion. EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.66 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues, up from 48%. North America gross profit grew 50% to $1.17 billion and gross margin increased 211 basis points to 23.6%, driven by increases in other revenue, improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 113% to $278 million, or 5.6% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 49% to $4.56 billion. Revenue growth was 37%, adjusting for the $344 million year-over-year favorable impact on foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 37% to $2.58 billion or 26% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 68% to $1.95 billion or 56% excluding FX. EGM now represents 43% of international revenues, up from 38%. International gross profit grew 42% to $806 million, or grew 31% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 79 basis points to 17.7%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales. International segment operating income increased 39% to $319 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 25%. Consolidated segment operating income grew 66% to $597 million or 6.3% of revenue, up 91 basis points year over year. Excluding the $31 million favorable impact from FX rates, CSOI grew 58%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 75% to $476 million, or 5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $85 million in Q4, or an 18% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $384 million, or $0.85 per diluted share compared with $225 million and $0.52 per diluted share. Now I will discuss full year results. Revenue grew 28% to $24.51 billion or 29% excluding the $182 million unfavorable impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. North America revenue grew 25% to $12.83 billion, and International grew 31% to $11.68 billion, or 33% growth excluding year over year changes in FX. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI grew 44% to $1.57 billion or 48% excluding $40 million of unfavorable impact from FX rates, and operating margin increased 71 basis points to 6.4%. GAAP operating income grew 34% to $1.13 billion or 4.6% of net sales. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.64 billion year over year to $6.37 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA rated money market funds and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. In January 2010 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock, replacing our previous share repurchase program. Inventory increased 55% to $2.17 billion and inventory turns were 12.2, unchanged from a year ago, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 56% to $5.61 billion and accounts payable days increased to 68 from 62 in the prior year. Our 2009 capital expenditures were $373 million. While we are not providing CapEx guidance on today\u2019s call, we want to remind you that we are beginning the transition to our new Seattle offices this year. We will incur incremental CapEx of approximately $100 million in 2010 in support of this multi-year project. I will conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as: settling intra-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries; unfavorable resolution of legal matters; and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. We are prospectively adopting accounting standard update #2009-13, Revenue Recognition, Multiple Delivery Revenue Arrangements as of January 1, 2010. Sales of our Kindle e-Reader are considered arrangements with multiple elements which include the device, wireless connectivity and software upgrades. The revenue related to the device, which is a substantial portion of the total sales price, and related costs, will be recognized at the time of delivery. Revenue for the wireless connectivity and the software upgrades will continue to be amortized over the life of the device, which remains estimated at two years. The impact of the adoption of the standard is included in the first quarter 2010 guidance. For Q1, we expect net sales of between $6.45 billion and $7 billion, or growth of between 32% and 43%. This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $275 million and $365 million or growth between 13% and 50%. This includes approximately $100 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $385 million and $475 million or growth of between 20% and 48%. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. With that, Rob, let's move to questions.\nRob Eldridge: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Mahaney \u2013 Citi.\nMark Mahaney: Quick question. That tax rate of 18%, should we extrapolate from that going forward? Secondly, any broad comment on your ability to sell, increasingly sell, consumer staples, particularly momentum behind that Subscribe and Save program? And then finally, could you help us quantify at all the Kindle impact? The difference in accounting, maybe by providing an adjustment for what Kindle revenue or something would have been like last year? Some way for us to parse out how much of an increase, or how much of the guidance could you speak to, to a change in the revenue recognition? Thanks a lot.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of tax rate it was 18% for the quarter, 22% for the year. That includes certainly the reason why the change in Q4 is related to the jurisdictions that we operate in. Again, we are not providing guidance beyond 2009 for taxes. In terms of consumer staples, it is certainly a category that we like. It is growing very nicely. Subscribers can save from an adoption standpoint, and it is working, so those are things we are going to continue to focus on, as well as other things to try to grow that particular category. As it relates to the Kindle change, we have provided some information in the 10-K. Essentially the way you should think about guidance is certainly the change is effective 01/01/10 so it is included on our Q1 guidance, so for the units that we sell, a substantial portion of the price times those units will be reflected in our revenue. In addition to that, we have approximately $500 million of deferred revenue from shipments from last year that we amortized between 2010 and 2011. So a portion of that $500 million will also be in Q1.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Mitchell \u2013 Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: Just to follow up on the previous question, you mentioned that a portion of the $500 million deferred revenue will be booked in Q1. Could you run through that, because I assume that it would be a retroactive restatement from previous quarters. Also, when you look at the Zappos benefit to 1Q10 revenue, is it [inaudible] 4Q09 $200 million, given on the one hand you have a full three months in the quarter? But on the other hand, it is the seasonally slower quarter? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the change, we are adopting it prospectively so as of 01/01 we are not restating. So again, that is reflected in our Q1 guidance. In terms of Zappos, how to think about it, I think probably the best way to do it would be \u2013 again, we are not giving guidance on Zappos specifically, it is reflected in the guidance that we gave for Q1 \u2013 we have released certainly previous quarters so you can go back to Q1 of last year and make your own assumptions in terms of growth rate for year over year and certainly there would be a range there, but you can see that is probably the best way to think about it and look at what you would put in for Q1.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Imran Khan \u2013 J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan: Thank you for taking my questions. One is housekeeping and one more of a big picture question. Housekeeping North American gross margins improved 200 basis points on a year over year basis? I am trying to understand what are some of the moving parts that are helping drive these gross margins higher, and how should we think about the swing factors in the North American gross margins. Secondly, as we look at the media business become more digital and we see more and more new devices coming to the marketplace, could you help us understand how AMZN\u2019s competitive position change in the marketplace? i.e. physical versus web, you have some competitive advantage but if a lot more devices are sold that you can download books electronically, how does your competitive position change?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of your first question, North American gross margins are up a little over 200 basis points as you mentioned. A number of drivers, certainly we had a nice increase in other revenue which includes the web services business and those other agreements that go into that line item. Inventory management, we are getting better at inventory management which also flows into our operating results as well. We are getting better prices from suppliers and partners. We had good third party sales. Those are the key contributors. Partially offsetting that were certainly lower prices during the quarter, so those are the drivers for gross margin. In terms of how we are thinking about the digital and physical within media, we think we are positioned very nicely from a digital perspective. We have obviously some longer-standing relationships with many, many different partners around the world in those particular categories. We think we are focused on the customer and I think Kindle is certainly a good example of that. We think we\u2019ve built a very-nice purpose-built device \u2013 excuse me, that is purpose-built for reading and we believe that readers deserve to have a dedicated device with great selection and great prices. So those are the things we\u2019ve worked on in the 27 months since launch and those are the things we will continue to focus on starting with the customer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel \u2013 Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: First of all, you\u2019ve been in Prime in the international markets for a little over two years now, and if we go back domestically you saw a nice little acceleration in unit growth when you hit the two-year mark. Is it safe to assume that you are seeing a similar trend internationally given the growth internationally plus the unit growth acceleration? Second question, you have got a lot of different services you\u2019ve worked on over the years between Kindle, digital music, digital video, cloud computing and web services. Is there any sort of perspective or view that you have that maybe there is an opportunity to consolidate or integrate all of these services together in a unified platform that can be licensed or OEM\u2019d to other companies to utilize while you manage the background behind it?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of your first question, Prime, we are very pleased with the performance of Prime in each of the geographies and it is certainly contributing to our international growth as well as it continues to help our North American growth. So other factors that are also helping international are certainly we\u2019ve added a number of categories; along with those categories comes a lot of selection. We\u2019ve continue to improve our in-stock levels. Prime, as you\u2019ve mentioned is helping and just making sure we have great prices. So getting product to customers fast is important and Prime is one of the ways that helps us do that. In terms of your second question, I am not sure there is a lot I can help you with there. In each of those services our primary focus is that we have a great customer experience, and that is the one thing that is common in all of those and we are going to continue to focus as we have in our physical business on how do we make sure that we have an integrated experience, and those are the things that are common.\nJeetil Patel: Do you think all those individual services can be offered as a bundled solution?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I would hate to speculate on something like that. We are focused on what is right for customers and many of those have distinct customer sets that are different from each other and we are focused on how to make that experience great.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Two questions. First, when you look at the deferred revenues on the cash flow statement I think you recognized 444, you had that much as deferred revenues this year in the fourth quarter versus 162. My first question is, is there anything materially different besides Kindle in those two numbers? Second thing, you say you have millions of Kindle users. Is it safe to assume that you have over 2 million now, at least? Finally, when you think about the category roll out road map, could you give us any thoughts on where you are in that? Are you 80% of all the categories you can roll out? Or are there still a lot more opportunity? How would you frame that opportunity at this point in your life cycle? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of deferred revenue, there are a number of things that go into deferred revenue. Certainly Kindle has been one of those. Kindle has [inaudible] for some time as we roll that off. The other is certainly Prime, as well as a few others, but those are certainly two of the bigger items. In terms of category roll out, hard to say in percentage terms but we have a lot of room to add additional selections. If you look at it on a worldwide basis, think about it this way: we have many new geographies that we can enter, some of which, many that we support today from an export standpoint but we could certainly roll out more geographies, so we can add category selection there. We can add many new categories in all of our geographies, and then also we are adding a selection in categories that we\u2019ve been in for 10 or more years, each year we continue to grow the selection of those categories. So it is one of the inputs to growth. It is one that we are very focused on and we continue to be focused on for many years to come, because there is just a lot of selection to add. And then I think there was a third part, I apologize\u2026\nJustin Post: For Kindle users, is it at least 2 million? Can you give us any thoughts on that?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Again, other than the quote I can\u2019t really add much to that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth \u2013 Barclays Capital.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking questions. Can you talk about your thoughts on potentially opening up to the epub reader standards for the Kindle, and also provide some color on why you\u2019ve separated the Kindle device team from the Kindle media team internally? Thanks.\nRob Eldridge: Hi Doug, it\u2019s Rob here. How are you doing? In terms of epub, our platform here is designed to have a seamless experience across the whole set of devices with whisper sync, and we think that\u2019s the right customer experience for us to continue to deliver in the future. And your second question?\nDouglas Anmuth: Separating out the Kindle device team from the Kindle media team internally.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Again, we are not commenting on how we are organized, we have a great team across many geographies to figure out the best way to serve customers and beyond that we can\u2019t comment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley.\nScott Devitt: Thanks for taking the question. First was related to the emergence of new hardware in the digital book business and also the emergence of potentially higher price points and how you think that your relationship with publishers could potentially evolve over time in terms of impacting the $9.99 price point? Secondly, and again just qualitatively because I know you won\u2019t answer this directly, but 3P mix U.S. versus International, can you give us some gauge in terms of the differences and distinctions in those areas? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of 3P, we are again pleased with both segments. We continue to grow nicely in our seller business and we continue to look for ways to improve that experience not only for our customers but for sellers, which is certainly another customer set that we have. One example of that is fulfill by Amazon which has certainly been helpful in terms of growing our selection from sellers and the number of sellers as well. In terms of discussions about any of the other relationships with vendors, and this would be any category, not just the one that you mentioned, certainly any of those discussions that we would have would be between us and those particular partners. But the main focus of those discussions would always be for us, how do we make sure we can offer customers the selection they want at great low prices? So those are the things that we are always continually focused on in each of our categories and each of our geographies.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal \u2013 Collins Stewart.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Thanks for taking my question. Tom, can you talk about the international penetration of Kindle? I know you don\u2019t talk about the units, but maybe in terms of number of countries where the Kindle is not available? But internationally, perhaps the ratio of U.S. versus non-U.S. units sold, or maybe the growth trajectory of Kindles sold in U.S. versus International?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure, obviously we are not providing a lot of data. It is available in 130 countries today. We think it is a great opportunity for customers as well as for us long term, and we are continually trying to figure out ways in those geographies even better than it is today. I can\u2019t add any more detail to that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Benjamin Schachter \u2013 Broadpoint AmTech.\nBenjamin Schachter: I just want to go back to the U.S. gross margin question. As I recall last year you talked a lot about the macro situation leading to better pricing from vendors, this year it sounds like you also got better pricing from your vendors. So any qualitative remarks on what is driving your ability to get the better vendor pricing? Is it purely volume or are there other things there? And then just quickly, any comments on the Amazon branded products? Any update there? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. No, it is certainly the biggest factor would be volume, but it is in a few different pieces. One is you can take a look at our overall growth, which in the case of North America was up 36%, that was certainly helped by Zappos as part of that. If you take out Zappos from the number that I gave you it would be 31% growth which is still a nice acceleration from where we\u2019ve been recently. So that is one, just overall volume. The other is when you look at North America, some of the categories that we\u2019re in that we\u2019ve just started a few years ago becoming more and more meaningful, so as those become more and more meaningful good things happen. We are able to get better prices from suppliers but also they become more attractive for third-party sellers to sell on our detail pages, so it is a combination of those items that allowed us to grow gross margins in Q4, while lowering prices for customers, so it was a combination of those factors.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Youssef Squali \u2013 Jefferies & Co.\nYoussef Squali: In the press release it said something to the effect that you sell six Kindle books for every ten physical books. Can you give us that number a year ago just so we can have something to compare it to? Second, I would like to ask the inverse of that question with regard to Apple and the operating system. Will Apple continue to support the Kindle app with their iPad?\nThomas J. Szkutak: To your second question, yes. The answer to your first question is I can\u2019t give you that, but again, so far this year six of ten was digital versus physical where we have both editions.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Colin Sebastien \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets.\nColin Sebastien: First about your pricing strategy, if there has been any change there with regard to being a price follower or a price leader? Secondly, looking at the Q1 outlook if you can talk about some of the variables that might lead to year over year contraction in the CSOI margin, was that Zappos-related perhaps, or deferred revenues from Kindle or something else?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of pricing, no, nothing has changed. We are all about making sure we have great prices across all of our categories across all of our geographies so nothing has changed there. In terms of Q1 we have given a range that we think is appropriate and as you can see from the lower end of the range, as you described, for the upper range you see operating margins improving year over year and again, we are very positive about what we saw in Q4 as well as what we saw as we progressed throughout 2009 yet there is still a degree of uncertainty out there and so we think that is representative of the guidance that we\u2019ve given and we think it is appropriate. In terms of your other questions, in terms of individual breakouts of businesses, we are not providing that as part of our guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question and answer session. Mr. Eldridge, I\u2019ll turn the conference back over to you.\nRob Eldridge: Great. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on the investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-10-22 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Amazon.com third quarter 2009 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead.\nRob Eldridge: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2009 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 22, 2009, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this web cast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thanks Rob. I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 98% to $1.92 billion. Return on invested capital was 50% up from 32%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock based awards outstanding was 451 million shares compared with 458 million. Worldwide revenue grew 28% to $5.45 billion or 29% excluding the $41 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful for our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, best selection and free shipping offers including Amazon Prime. Media revenue increased to $2.93 billion, up 17% or 18% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $2.36 billion up 44% or 45% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 43% of worldwide sales up from 38%. Worldwide unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded 98 million, up 17%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.8 million, up 24%. Seller units were 31% of total units. Worldwide gross profit was $1.27 billion, up 27%. Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined were $923 million or 17% of sales, down 107 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $444 million or 8.2% of revenue compared with 8.9%. Tech and content was $267 million or 4.9% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $144 million or 2.6% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year. Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with the prior periods we do not allocate the segments, our stock based compensation or other operating expense income net line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 23% to $2.84 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $1.41 billion. EGM revenue grew 36% to $1.29 billion, representing 45% of North America revenues, up from 41%. This week we started shipping Kindle with U.S. and International wireless and lowered its price to $259 from $279. This newest Kindle is available to ship to customers living outside the U.S. Customers in more than 100 countries around the world and U.S. customers traveling abroad can take advantage of Kindle\u2019s 3G wireless technology and download a title in 60 seconds or less. North America gross profit grew 28% to $752 million and gross margin increased 101 basis points to 26.5%, driven by increases in other revenue in 3P product sales, improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 77% to $156 million, a 5.5% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 33% to $2.61 billion. Revenue growth was 35%, adjusting for the $39 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.52 billion and EGM revenue grew 54% to $1.06 billion or 58% excluding FX.  EGM now represents 41% of international revenues, up from 35%. International gross profit grew 26% to $521 million, or grew 30% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 108 basis points to 20%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management including vendor prices and increases in 3P product sales. International segment operating income increased 36% to $194 million, a 7.4% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 44%. Consolidated segment operating income grew 52% to $350 million or 6.4% of revenue, up 101 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $10 million unfavorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 56%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses. GAAP operating income grew 62% to $251 million, or 4.6% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $60 million in Q3, or a 23% rate for the quarter.  GAAP net income was $199 million, or $0.45 per diluted share compared with $118 million and $0.27 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.68 billion year-over-year to $4 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consists of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA rated money market funds and other investment grade securities.  Such amounts are recorded at fair value. Inventory increased 23% to $1.62 billion and inventory turns decreased to $12.1 from $12.4 a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 50% to $3.35 billion and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 63 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $355 million from a year ago to $1.09 billion. Our Q3 capital expenditures were $103 million. I\u2019ll conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance.  Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions.  Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending.  It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our guidance. Our guidance excludes the impact of Zappos, including approximately $35 million of expenses related primarily to employee compensation costs, amortization of intangibles and merger related expenses that would be recognized in the fourth quarter 2009 if the transaction closes as planned. Guidance further assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they\u2019ve been recently. For Q4, we expect net sales of between $8.125 billion and $9.125 billion, or growth between 21% and 36%.  This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $300 million and $425 million or grow between 10% and 56%.  This includes approximately $100 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between $400 million and $525 million or growth between 11% and 46%. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. With that, Rob, let's move to questions.\nRob Eldridge: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Mitchell at Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: Thank you very much for taking my question. It looks like you enjoyed very strong sequential North America revenue growth, both media and EGM, much stronger in fact than you have enjoyed in previous quarters. Could you talk about what drove that quarter-on-quarter growth in North America revenue?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. If you take a look at -- if you recall from 90 days ago, we did see a nice sequential increase, but as a reminder, Q2, we had a strong -- a difficult compare from the previous year, Q2 of 2008. But even we still saw acceleration if you look at Q1 of 2009 or Q4 of 2008. And it was very broad, you know, within the media categories. In fact, all the major categories within media saw an acceleration from Q2 to Q3, so it's very broad and it was driven by a lot of the fundamentals. You know, having great low prices, certainly we had selection increases, in-stock increases during the quarter, as well as Prime is certainly having an impact. So all of those things certainly had an impact. Also as a reminder, you know North America as we finished Q3 of last year, certainly the last few weeks of the quarter were softer, given what was going on economically. But again, we saw very strong growth in the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. My question is on the margin outlook for the fourth quarter. We have heard some competitors out there are getting more aggressive with price, on books especially but other areas. Maybe if you could characterize your view on the margin environment in the fourth quarter. And then secondly, on unearned revenue, it looked like it was up $197 million, a little less growth than in second quarter or in absolute dollars. Is that reflective at all of the Kindle, or are there other things in the unearned revenue line we should think about? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of your first question, you know, what we anticipate will happen, Q4 was reflective of the guidance that we gave you. It's obviously a challenging, in any Q4, to give guidance and given what's going on externally, from a macro environment standpoint, it's certainly a challenging time to do so. But we still feel -- that being said, we feel very good about what we saw in Q3; customers responding very positively, and right now we're heads down focused on making sure that we have a great customer experience during Q4. Around the world right now we're focused on making sure that we have great low prices, that we are getting our inventory, making sure that our in-stocks are where they need to be and selection on hand. You can see our inventory did increase as we -- as it has in previous Q3s and that's really getting ready for Q4. So we're optimistic and we've given a wide range, given that optimism, and we're focused on customers. So again, hard to predict what will happen. But in terms of competitive environment, certainly it is very competitive. It's been very competitive since the day we launched and we have many different competitors in all the different categories that we operate in around the world.\nJustin Post: And then on unearned revenue?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Certainly there are a number of things that go into unearned revenue and certainly we have some marketing relationships. Kindle goes in there, Prime goes in there. So there are a number things going in. It can be a little bit lumpy, because of some of the things that go in, but certainly the principle pieces being, that we have certainly have talked about in the past being Kindle and Prime, are doing very well and we\u2019re very, very pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing in both of those and we\u2019re excited with the announcement that we have related to Kindle that we can offer our newest Kindle at $259 effective today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Youssef Squali from Jefferies & Co.\nYoussef Squali: Would you consider opening up Kindle to supporting other formats, considering the increasing availability of content from other providers? And related to that, is there a threshold above which you\u2019d start actually breaking out Kindle sales for us to gauge the level of your success?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of breaking out Kindle, certainly as you get to certain sizes, we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019ve broken out various countries and we would follow whatever is required to do so, and obviously in the results that we give we try to be as helpful as we can. In terms of opening up Kindle, there\u2019s not a lot I can add to that. I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate what we might or might not do there, but what we are focused on Kindle is obviously to make sure we offer customer experience and we\u2019re heads down focused on making sure that we do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from Barclays Capital.\nDouglas Anmuth: Can you talk about your profitability and the margins in particular being about 60 points above the high end of your range? I\u2019m just curious on what the biggest delta was on your results versus what you were expecting for the quarter there. And then secondly, it looks like your accounts payables days went to 72, which is a pretty significant increase. What were the key drivers in that?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the margin, what you really are seeing, a number of factors but certainly a principal one is you\u2019re seeing we had very strong growth. You\u2019re seeing very good leverage in our operating costs and if you look at our gross margin, we\u2019re essentially flat year over year and you saw good leverage in operating costs, and really across all the key items. So we had very good leverage. Certainly when you look at our operating costs, there is a variable component and there\u2019s also a fixed component and so the fixed is where you\u2019re seeing the largest leverage. In terms of AP, we did see a very big increase. That\u2019s also reflected in the inventory that we brought in at the end of Q3, getting ready for the holidays. Keep in mind that when you compare that to last year at this time, there\u2019s a little bit of some seasonality, if you will, because if you recall particularly in the U.S. we saw a little bit of a slow down near the end of Q3. And so when that happens and there was certainly uncertainty related to what was going on in Q4, you\u2019re seeing probably a little less replenishment than you would see given the results that you just saw in Q3. So part of that is certainly just more timing related as it relates to the two types of quarters we\u2019re dealing with. There\u2019s also some mix of business there, as well as some better terms with suppliers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley\nScott Devitt: Understanding there\u2019s been unique volatility in business conditions in currency, when you gave first quarter guidance it was a range of 6% to 17%, then you did 14% and when you guided the recent quarter, you gave 11% to 23% and did 28%. I was just wondering if you could comment on your visibility into 4Q, given the still wide revenue range that you\u2019ve given and the back-end loaded nature of the quarter, and the way that it seems business improved meaningfully throughout Q3, even after accounting for the September 15th event of last year.\nThomas J. Szkutak: I think the only thing I could say is we\u2019re giving a wide range. The range is 21% to 36% growth on a dollar basis. We have reflected what exchange rates are recently which is approximately 500 basis points of impact, which would be 16% to 21%, and that wide range reflects, as I talked about a little bit earlier on the call, that uncertainty. That being said, we like what we saw in Q3 and as you also mention and inherent in your question, it is a back-end loaded quarter. It is very seasonal and December is by far our largest month in terms of overall revenue, and so it is all in front of us. That is why for us right now it is a very busy time as you can probably imagine, and we are focused very heavily on how do we make that experience as good as we possibly can for customers. We try to give guidance that reflects very good growth for the quarter but a wide range, given the uncertainty.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of  Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: A couple of questions -- you have hit the two-year mark for Amazon Prime in Japan and almost in Europe. Are you seeing the same type of frequency lift you saw with Prime in the U.S. in terms of magnitude of change in behavior? Second question, on FBA, are you seeing the ramp in FBA influence frequency as a whole on the business as you look at the U.S. market as you have better in-stock on products available from you guys?\nRob Eldridge: Consistent with what we have said, we are still very happy with the Prime programs worldwide. When we look at the international Prime programs, not only in Japan but also in Europe, we are seeing similarities in terms of subscriber growth as well as renewal rates. Across the geographies, Prime members tend to come to the site more often, shop with us more frequently and also explore more of the different stores. So you tend to see more cross-shopping. We are very, very happy with Amazon Prime across the globe. In terms of FBA, we think it is a win for the seller so we think it is a win for the customers. You saw in our results today that we still are seeing good growth with the FBA program here with where we are in this period of time. We are going to continue to put a lot of energy into both those programs for the benefit of our customers.\nJeetil Patel: Are those influencing frequency or attach rates?\nRob Eldridge: You are talking specifically about FBA?\nJeetil Patel: Yes.\nRob Eldridge: It is -- Again, I talk to you in the context of whenever you have the opportunity to deliver product to a customer in the United States with a guaranteed 2-day delivery or even faster if people are looking for express delivery, it is a positive thing for customers.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster: Back on the margin side, some of the things you have been changing within the business model in terms of private labels and the product adds, which conceptually carry a higher margin, is that starting to have an impact on margin or are they just too small to be adding up to anything?\nThomas J. Szkutak: We haven\u2019t broken out the impact of either of those two but again in terms of private label, we certainly like that selection that we have but it is still a relatively small part of our overall selection. That is certainly something you can see by just browsing our website. You can look and it is still a relatively small part of the selection.\nGene Munster: Is there any growth in terms of the SKUs you have for private label you can disclose?\nThomas J. Szkutak: No, we haven\u2019t -- you know, we aren\u2019t breaking out any of the individual categories or also sales by vendor at all.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Pitts from UBS.\nBrian Pitts: A question on your shipping costs -- if you look, your outbound shipping as a percentage of sales was about 6% in the quarter. That is the lowest we have seen in quite some time. Are you seeing much better shipping efficiencies or is it really a function of higher digital media sales as part of that?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I think at the end of the day there is lots of factors that go into our shipping costs.  Part of what I think you are seeing during the quarter is we again saw good unit growth and we were able to leverage that sort of volume throughout the entire logistics chain.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Heath Terry from FBR Capital Markets.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. Can you give us a sense of the traction that you are getting within the various components of Amazon Web Services? And then just to what extent that business as a whole is contributing to the margin out performance that we are seeing this quarter?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I\u2019m sorry, Heath, I missed the first part of your question -- it was about?\nHeath Terry: Sure -- within Amazon Web services, the individual services that are available within that, which ones are you seeing the most traction with and have the highest level of expectations for?\nThomas J. Szkutak: It\u2019s similar to the rest of our business, we don\u2019t discuss the specific results of the different services. But we are seeing lots of demand around EC2 and S3 and SimpleDB. Developers use these services in different ways to create their own unique applications so we have a range of enterprise customers, start ups, academic institutions who are using AWS for a diverse set of use cases and using these building blocks to create unique solutions.  I think it\u2019s very early with AWS but we\u2019re very encouraged by the response that we\u2019re getting from our customer base right now and we\u2019re going to continue to innovate on their behalf. As I mentioned, part of the margin would certainly be part of the other revenue increase, some of the other things we talked about including marketing, Amazon enterprise services, web services, this would be larger pieces of the other.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Citi.\nMark Mahaney: Two questions please -- the fulfillment leverage, I think that 8.1% as a percentage of revenue is the lowest you\u2019ve ever had in the third quarter, so is there something that\u2019s sustainable there?  Could you talk about whether that\u2019s a base to think about it?  I know there\u2019s seasonality in that line but that seemed to strike us as a bit of an outlayer. Secondly, international, you\u2019re showing this accelerating international growth without the recession. We probably would have seen it the last couple of quarters.  Have you decided from now on you\u2019re just going to ship your way to growth internationally and you don\u2019t need to expand beyond the countries that you are in?  I only ask because you haven\u2019t expanded to a new international market with a base station there in about four years but you seem to be doing fine without it, so is that the strategy from now on?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of fulfillment, the operations team has done a great job in improving our overall efficiencies and so you\u2019re certainly seeing that reflect in our fulfillment.  One reminder as you look at fulfillment expense as a percentage of revenue versus last year, last year we had just opened up three FCs and that\u2019s reflected in the Q3 balance of last year in terms of expenses. In terms of international, no, you should expect to see that we will launch new geographies over time. What you\u2019re seeing reflected in the growth right now is some of the things I talked about earlier, but we have added a lot of selection.  We\u2019ve added a lot of new categories over the past couple of years and because of the opportunities we have in the existing countries that we operate in. So the team has done a great job at adding many new categories, adding selection within those categories, adding selection within the categories we are already in, making sure that we have great low prices and executing operationally, as well as certainly prime is helping us internationally as well, so all of those are combining in the results that you see. But no, you should expect to see more selection expansion going forward within the categories we are in, as well as geographical expansion over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Friedland from Cowen & Company.\nJames Friedland: A question as long as we\u2019re on the topic of international, the Kindle going in to international markets, in terms of getting foreign language rights, what are the hurdles to achieving that especially in your core international markets like Germany?  What are the hurdles, what might be the timing to launch foreign language titles? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Certainly, it's an opportunity for us, and not unlike, you know, we have very good relationships with a lot of the publishers and content owners in the geographies that we operate in and certainly it's an opportunity for us over time to expand selection. Again, keep in mind from a Kindle perspective, our long-term vision is to have every title ever printed in any language available on Kindle in less than 60 seconds. It's certainly a big goal and something the team is certainly working towards.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Benjamin Schachter from Broadpoint AmTech.\nBenjamin Schachter: Last quarter you called out video games as impacting the quarter and I was wondering if you could update us on how that category impacted this quarter. And then also, given the success of the Kindle, what are the types of criteria you use to decide any other types of devices you might try to sell directly to consumers? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of video games, we are not breaking out any categories specifically this quarter, but what I would say is within media, we did see an acceleration in all of the key categories from Q2 to Q3. [inaudible] speculation on any other devices, I wouldn't want to speculate what we might or might not do there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal with Collins Stewart.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, can you talk about contribution from any one-time items in your media segment during the quarter, i.e. any popular gaming or books title, or maybe pre-sale of Window 7 contribution? And then second is on Kindle -- can you talk about the linearity over the quarter? Did the lower price help you to hit maybe the tipping point sooner?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I'm sorry, I missed the -- in your first question, you asked for any one-time items in the growth that we saw?\nSandeep Aggarwal: In the media segment.\nThomas J. Szkutak: I'm sorry, was there more to it? I missed the last part of that first question. I apologize.\nSandeep Aggarwal: That's all right, Tom. So I was -- basically I wanted to know the contribution from one-time items in your media segment during the quarter, such as pre-sale of Windows 7 or any popular gaming title, such as maybe the V-Sports Resort or any popular book titles.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. We did see -- you know, it was -- we did see better releases than we've seen in previous quarters, particularly in the second half of the quarter, which is contributing to the growth that you see. But if you look at the growth that was essentially flat in Q2, to the 13% on a dollar basis of 14% on a local currency basis, the lion's share is not these-- some of the new titles that were out there, but certainly contributed to the growth rate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Imran Khan from J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan: Thank you for taking my questions. I have two quick housekeeping questions and one more [inaudible] question -- so in terms of the international gross margins, it seems like international gross margins are down 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. I tried to better understand what's driving that disparate growth in the third-party business. And secondly, user growth 17%, active user growth, can you help me understand, is it more tilted toward international or are you seeing broad-base growth? And more of a big picture question is regarding Web services -- it seems like talking to the developers that Amazon Web services is getting a lot of critics. Can you give us some sense, like what do you think is the gating factor that still only low-single digit percentage of IT spending is Cloud computing, why it's not moving faster?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of international gross margins, one of the things certainly we are seeing is impacting it is lower prices to customers, changes in product mix. If you look at our EGM growth in Q3, it was up 58% on a local currency basis. That compares to 48% growth last year. International media was up 22% in the quarter, up 18% versus last year. So that mix of shift towards a higher percentage of EGM is certainly impacting gross margins in the quarter. That, between lower prices and change in mix, was partially offset by improvements in 3P as well as vendor pricing and inventory management. So that's really what's impacting gross margins. In terms of Web services, we are very optimistic about Web services. We have some great services that are getting some very good traction. It\u2019s very early and the teams have done a great job in terms of executing on those services and making those reliable. There\u2019s great pricing on those services and the team has continued to innovate in that space. So the team is very excited about it and we like what we see there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay from Sanford Bernstein.\nJeffrey Lindsay: Will it be necessary as in previous years to significantly increase staffing for the holiday season, or do you think you\u2019re already happy with current staffing levels? And then could you give us any kind of comment on how progress is going with [Goyo] Amazon, given [Cabo\u2019s] recent payments to have 78% of e-commerce in China? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of staffing, every year we supplement our teams and our FCs around the world with additional staffing and this year will be no different, and we\u2019ve continued to add some capacity, particularly in international recently to get ready to serve our customers. In terms of [Goyo], we\u2019re not breaking out in terms of giving any statistics on any of the growth in each of the geographies today but in terms of how we feel about [Goyo], we think our business in China is very good. We have a very good team there. Their focus is consistent with other geographies in trying to make sure that we have good customer experience and we think that China is a great long term opportunity and the team is working very hard on behalf of customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: I was wondering, given how much free cash flow you guys are generating, if you could just update us on your thoughts in terms of uses of cash and maybe how acquisitions fit into that, and then how you maybe think about whether to build versus buy when you think about product category expansion. Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of use of cash, I wouldn\u2019t speculate what we might do except for we still have an authorization for share repurchases, that there\u2019s $900 million remaining on the authorization, so certainly that would be potentially part of our plans. When you think of acquisitions, we look at those opportunistically. It\u2019s not something new. We\u2019ve been looking at acquisitions for a number of years now and when we find ones that we like, we\u2019ve done some to enter new geographies over time. We\u2019ve done some where we think speed to market is important. We\u2019ve done some where we like the team has a very specific skill set. So there are a number of different types of ones that we\u2019ve done and there\u2019s not much I can add to that. We will continue our focus there like we have over the past years and as there\u2019s opportunities, we\u2019ll certainly look at what makes sense.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: I wanted to focus on the book category, obviously a lot of press lately about the new pricing strategies. The question would be, as we think about our models, both from a sales and maybe even a margin perspective, near and longer term, how should we think about some of the changes that have been made in book pricing lately?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat the second half of that question?\nBrian Nagel: I was saying as we think about models, and particularly in sales growth, or in margins, in books, how could the recent actions on book pricing affect those numbers?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I apologize. We haven\u2019t broken out the growth rates or the margins of the book category. It\u2019s included, the books margins would be included in our North America gross margins for those sales in North America and the corresponding ones in international. I think the way you should think about any of our categories is that we operate in competitive environments and that is something that has existed since the day we opened our doors. From our perspective, we are going to continue to focus on what is right for our customers and as I have mentioned a number of times on this call, and that is in all of our categories and all of our geographies, and so those are the things that because it is important to customers. In terms of also, when you talk about margins, one thing we clearly do is our focus is on primary [areas] is free cash flow and free cash flow per share, and so we focus on those operating profit dollars and free cash flow dollars and not individual margins.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Aaron Kessler from Kaufman Bros.\nAaron Kessler: First, any update on Checkup by Amazon? Clearly there seems to be some resistance from some pure play competitors and maybe expanding outside of their core retail market. I\u2019m not sure if you commented but U.S. other revenues is up about 20% sequentially. I just wanted to see if you had an explanation for the strong growth in that category.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Checkup by Amazon is -- you know, it\u2019s very, very early and the team is doing a good job there but it is very early and we think it is a nice opportunity and the team is executing well there but it\u2019s -- again, it is very early for us. In terms of other, beyond what we have said already I don\u2019t have a lot to add there. Certainly the pieces that roll into there are our web services business, which is getting good traction, our co-branded credit card arrangements, we have some promotional and marketing revenues, and then Amazon Enterprise Services. So those are the make-up of other and what is reflected in the growth that you are seeing there. We do have -- some of that revenue is promotional in nature or marketing in nature and can tend to be, as we have seen in some quarters, a little bit lumpy and so that is the only color I could add to it.\nAaron Kessler: On tax rate, any guidance for Q4? It has been jumping around somewhat this year.\nTom Szkutak: No. If you look at our year-to-date tax rate adjusted for any larger items would reflect our best estimate for the year at this stage.\nRob Eldridge: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-07-24 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Amazon.com second quarter 2009 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge.\nRob Eldridge: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2009 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. As Jeff is traveling today, Tom and I will be available for Q&A. The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2009, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this Web cast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 89% to $1.54 billion. Return on invested capital was 42%, up from 29%. ROI fee is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 451.0 million shares compared with 446.0 million. Worldwide revenue grew 14% to $4.65 billion, or 20%, excluding the $227.0 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $2.44 billion, up 1% or 7% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $2.70 billion, up 35% or 41% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 45% of worldwide sales up from 38%. Worldwide unit growth was 28%. Active customer accounts exceeded 94.0 million, up 16%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.7 million, up 21%. Seller units were 30% of total units. Worldwide gross profit was $1.13 billion, up 17%. Now we will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology, and content and G&A combined was $829.0 million, or 17.8% of sales, unchanged year-over-year. Fulfillment was $389.0, or 8.4% of revenue, while tech and content was $253.0 million, or 5.5% of revenue. Marketing was $124.0 million, or 2.7% of revenue, up 23 basis points from the prior year. Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we cannot allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense, income net line item. In the North America segment revenue grew 13% to $2.45 billion. Media revenue was flat at $1.15 billion with declines in some categories, particularly video games and video game consoles offset by growth in books. EGM revenue grew 29% to $1.19 billion, representing 48% of North America revenues, up from 42%. Kindle sales continue to exceed our expectations and we reduced the price of Kindle, the number one best seller in our consumer electronics store, to $299. North America gross profit grew 20% to $672.0 million and gross margin increased 161 basis points to 27.4%, driven by increases in third-party product sales, improvement in inventory management, including vendor pricing, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 30% to $125.0 million, a 5.1% operating margin. In the international segment revenue grew 16% to $2.2 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusted for the $221.0 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 3% to $1.29 billion, or 12% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 45% to $882.0 million, or 60% excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 40% of international revenues, up from 32%. International gross profit grew 13% to $461.0 million, or grew 27% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 56 basis points to 20.9%, driven by low prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and increases in 3-P product sales. International segment operating income increased 20% to $179.0 million, an 8.1% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 43%. CSOI grew 24% to $304.0 million, or 6.5% of revenue, up 51 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $30.0 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 37%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense income. GAAP operating income fell 27% to $159.0 million, or 3.4% of net sales. Second quarter 2009 operating income included the impact of our settlement with Toys R Us for $51.0 million, substantially all of which as expensed during the quarter. A one-time payment from Amazon.com will take place in the third quarter of 2009. Additionally, included in the second quarter of 2008 GAAP operating income, was a $53.0 million non-cash gain recognized on the sale of our European DVD rental assets. Our income tax expense was $39.0 million in Q2, or a 22% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $142.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared with $158.0 million and $0.37 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $831.0 million year-over-year to $3.21 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government, and government agency securities, triple- A-rated money market funds, and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. Inventory increased 20% to $1.32 billion and inventory turns decreased to 12.4 from 13 a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 28% to $2.51 billion and accounts payable days increased to 65 from 58 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $330.0 million from a year ago to $981.0 million. Our Q2 2009 capital expenditures was $78.0 million. Yesterday we announced the acquisition of Zappos. Zappos is a customer-focused company. We see great opportunities for both companies to learn from each other and create even better experiences for our customers. I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the trends that we've seen today and we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we have described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes Zappos' financial results and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q3 we expect net sales of between $4.75 billion and $5.25 billion, a growth of between 11% and 23%. This guidance anticipates approximately 150 basis point of negative impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $120.0 million and $210.0 million, or between 22% decline and 36% growth. This includes approximately $95.0 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $250.0 million and $305.0 million, or between 7% decline and 32% growth. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time with some variability, including some changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. With that, let's move to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citi.\nMark Mahaney: I would like to ask about North America trends, particularly gross margins and media sales, and to what extent there's a link there. Last quarter you had a pretty positive gross margin trend. You repeated this quarter. But last quarter it seemed to be because of some unusual access to inventory. Was that effect still in place in the second quarter, or is there something going on in terms of the mix shift within media sales towards digital products that's really boosting those gross margins?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I'll start with the gross margin question. We saw in North America, and in international, we saw very solid 3-P product sales so 3-P is certainly impacting margins. We had very execution on a lot of other areas, including inventory management. We had very good pricing with our suppliers, which was offset partially, certainly, by lower prices for our customers, as well as product mix. So that's really what is driving the gross margins. In terms of the North America media growth, we saw, and just as a reminder, as I mentioned on the last call, we had very strong revenue growth Q2 of last year, which includes, if you look at it versus any other quarter over the past several quarters, it's our strongest quarter, including the growth that we saw in North America media which was up 25%. And we had some declines in some categories, particularly video games and consoles. Video games and consoles were very, very strong last year and we had both console growth and video games themselves being strong growth. Three of our four best releases of last year were released during Q2, including wii fit. And so that was included in our Q2 last year and was driving the growth last year and we're overlapping that. And what you're really seeing is an industry slowdown in video games and consoles. And then we had books growth offsetting that decrease. So those are the factors that were included in there. And just another note. On the video games, even though we saw a decline, we're actually very happy with that category. We have added a lot of selections since last year. Our in-stock levels have improved dramatically from last year and there's a number of other things that the team has done to make that customer experience even better. So we are very pleased with the customer experience we're providing there and what we're seeing is an industry slowdown, which we saw the effect of that in our growth rates.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: As you look at fulfillment by Amazon, can you talk a little bit more about the impact you're seeing from FBA on the businesses in the form of just margin contribution. Is it in the form of unit growth or just a pickup in customer growth. A little bit more on how FBA so far is influencing the businesses or effecting the business. Second, if you look at Prime internationally, is Prime internationally helping to drive the same behavior trends by region in the U.K., German and Japanese markets as you rolled it out and you've been in there for about a year and a half to two years now.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Those two programs, specifically, we're extremely pleased with. Prime, on a global basis, is doing very well and in international we're seeing very similar trends to what we saw when we launched in the U.S. It's been very successful for us. When you look at our international growth rate up 28% year-over-year on a local currency basis, and that's with, actually if you look compared to Q2 you saw a 28% growth rate as well in Q2 but we had a favorable comparison with the Easter holiday and an unfavorable comparison in Q2. So we had very strong growth rate and certainly Prime is helping that growth rate. In terms of FBA, there's not a lot in terms of specifics from a margin standpoint I can provide today. But Prime is growing very well and it's certainly impacting our third-party growth and our third-party growth, from a units perspective, is 30% as percentage of total units, which was up by year-over-year, again, in Q2. So we're pleased with the growth rate and certainly FBA is contributing to that.\nJeetil Patel: Is the biggest influence on units or customers? Customer adds.\nThomas J. Szkutak: There's not a lot I can add to that. I apologize.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mary Meeker and Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley.\nMary Meeker: To extend on Mark Mahaney's question a little bit, you said in effect you're not really a slowdown in your media business from any digital transitions that are taking place in music or video? And another question, is you EGM business is doing extremely well, can you correlate any of the things that are going on with digital media transitions with upticks in your products that play those products, if you will? And then on mobile, and question for Jeff, we're seeing tremendous e-commerce momentum in other parts of the world and we're starting to see it in the U.S. You have a great app for Amazon on the iPhone and you have a great Kindle app, you have a great Stanza app. Is it your view that mobile can be a material portion of Amazon's revenue in the next few years?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I'll take the media one first. Certainly there's, industry, there's some certainly slowness in some of the media categories. And we're seeing some of that slowness reflected in the North America results that you see. But in terms of what's happened recently, from a trend standpoint, it's clearly the challenging pair that we had versus last year, as well as the video games impact that I mentioned. In terms of digital, it's still very early, and we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of growth of our various digital products that we offer, techs, video and music. But it's still very early, and we're seeing very good unit growth there and we're very pleased with what we see there. From an EGM perspective, there's not a lot I can give you in terms of the individual growth rates of some of those items that you mentioned, but we're seeing very good broad-based growth within EGM. We did see some slowness to some of the higher selling priced items but outside of that we're very pleased with what we're seeing. Overall unit growth globally remains very strong so we're very pleased with that. In terms of mobile, it's a great question. And I apologize, Jeff is not on the call today. He's traveling and just from a scheduling standpoint it didn't work. But again, we certainly think that mobile is an opportunity. As you mentioned, there are a number of applications that we have. We are going to continue to innovate in that space and it's difficult to say how big that could be over time but it's certainly something that we're excited about and we are investing in.\nScott Devitt: The operating margin guidance that you gave, the midpoint was 5.2% and this quarter, in the second quarter, the midpoint of your guidance was 5.3%. You did 6.5%, which was the highest operating margin since the third quarter of 2005, so I understand there's some one-time dynamics going on in the industry right now, but you didn't have great visibility to that over performance in Q2 and I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit to the conservatism in the midpoint of your operating income in Q3.\nThomas J. Szkutak: We gave guidance of 215 to 305 from a CSOI perspective, which is implied operating margin of 4.5% to 5.8%, so from the upper end of the guidance, at 5.8%, that's about 40 basis points above last year. And so, again, we think that reflects the right range for the quarter. One thing to keep in mind, though, is as you look at Q2 to Q3, those numbers that we were just talking about were the absolute and then comparing them year-over-year, when you look at it sequentially from Q2 to Q3, keep in mind that Q3 historically is a quarter that we're getting ready for our largest seasonal quarter, Q4, and so there are certainly expenses that are included in that quarter to get ready for, for example, adding additional capacity, and certainly with the growth that we've seen, particularly in international, we are adding capacity to get ready for Q4. So that's reflected in our Q3 guidance and it's typical at this time to be doing that based on getting ready for Q4. So again, that's one of the reasons why you saw a decline last year as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Mitchell \u2013 Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: Looks like your sales and marketing costs pick up a little bit as a center of revenue by quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Could you talk about what's going on behind that. And also if you could discuss your effective tax rate.\nThomas J. Szkutak: From a marketing perspective it was 2.7% of revenue. The range over the past several quarters has been in the low 2%'s, 2.2% to 2.7% I believe. So it was a little bit on the higher end of the range. But again, I wouldn't  read too much into that. It's just based on the opportunities we saw within the quarter, looking at new customer acquisitions. So gain, I don't think there's anything really meaningful to talk about there. In terms of effective tax rate, the way I'm thinking about is if you look at the effective tax rate for the half, it's a little bit over 25%. Keep in mind that we had a one-time item, Toys R Us, which was $51.0 million. Substantially all of that would be in that number, which is tax effected at the U.S. tax rate. So that's bringing it down a bit. It's a one-time event so if you back that out the tax rate would be a little bit higher than that, which would reflect essentially the projection for the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Imran Khan \u2013 J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan: I think in the past you talked about how you are not seeing cannibalization from Kindle. I think you talked about like how average Kindle owners are buying 1.8 books. Can you give us an update on that number, what kind of trend you are seeing now that you have a larger Kindle owner. And secondly, I think you talked about that you are seeing healthy growth in the third-party and international business, but international gross profit margins I believe was down on a year-over-year basis, roughly 50 basis points. Could you give us some color to understand why. I think you talked about that you are seeing healthy growth in the third-party and international business, but international gross profit margins I believe was down on a year-over-year basis, roughly 50 basis points. Could you give us some color to understand why.\nThomas J. Szkutak: I'll take the third-party first, for international. What you're seeing there is we did actually see very good third-party growth in international. One thing to keep in mind is when you look at our overall growth rates in international, we saw extremely strong EGM growth accelerated to 60% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Many of those categories, if you look back over the past few years, we've launched a number of new categories in EGM in international. And when we launch new categories oftentimes the gross margins are lower, again, as we're starting out in those categories. So that's reflecting the product mix. But if you look at our overall international gross margins, we certainly saw strong third-party growth, very good vendor management, very good inventory management. But certainly partially offset by the mix that I'm talking about as well as lower prices for customers. In terms of the Kindle units, we're not doing any updates in terms of the units, in terms of specific numbers today, but we're seeing very, very good growth and we are extremely happy with the growth that we're seeing there and it's exceeding our expectations.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster: There's been a lot of talk about the tax rate and some third-party affiliates and the impact and some of the jockeying around where taxes are ultimately going in terms of sales tax. Can you give us how, just generally, you think about the sales tax question over the next several years.\nThomas J. Szkutak: It's one of these where we've been working for quite a few years with the states on the streamline sales tax act. Beyond that it's really hard to comment on what will happen going forward.\nRob Eldridge: It's important to remember that more than 50% of our business is conducted in areas where consumption tax, the VAT tax through the equivalent of sales tax are taking place are in international geographies. And we now collect sales taxes in five states in the United States. So we have very strong businesses in our international business as you can see from today's results.\nGene Munster: So do you think ultimately that sales tax will be part of as 100% of sales in the next five years, say?\nThomas J. Szkutak: We can't speculate what will happen going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post \u2013 Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: On the media sales decline, when you think longer term, do you think you might see some pressure on revenues but the overall gross margins per unit going to hang in there because of digitization and could you actually see a margin improvement offset lower prices for insales. And tech and content looks like it ticked up $24.0 million quarter-over-quarter. I wondered if you had any comments you could share with us on where you're allocating that money.\nThomas J. Szkutak: The way I think about the gross margins for our digital business is if you look at our overall digital business, it's very early. Think of it that we're investing, in the investing mode. And over time we think we can get very good returns for shareholders. And we think that there's a lot of room for us and content owners and publishers to do well there. And we think that we will get good returns over time. In terms of tech and content, there are a number of things that are going in there. You can see from our employment numbers that the growth is approximately 14% year-over-year. It slowed from past quarters but we did still see a sequential increase of about 400 people. Some of those people are certainly going to tech and content, investing in areas like digital and Web services and other areas, which are certainly reflected in the tech and content costs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth \u2013 Barclays Capital.\nDouglas Anmuth: Can you comment on the unearned revenues line, and in particular it looks like you've had a very good consistent trend there over the last several quarters, which I believe is probably fueled by Prime and the Kindle and you said that you're pretty comfortable with where both of those products are, but basically we're seeing from Q1 to Q2 a flat number in unearned revenue, so if you could provide some clarity on that I would appreciate it.\nThomas J. Szkutak: There are a number of things that go in there, including the items that you mentioned. You know, we do amortize the sale of Kindles over two years in the month following the sale, we are amortizing the Prime subscriptions. There's also other partner relationship revenues that go into that online that do some amortization and beyond that it does bounce around a bit as you can see from the trend, but beyond that there's not a lot I can add from a color perspective.\nDouglas Anmuth: You mentioned earlier that Prime growth was pretty good. Is there any reason to think that there's any slowdown here in terms of new members coming on board?\nThomas J. Szkutak: No, in fact Prime growth is very strong and obviously, from our other discussions, Kindle growth is very strong. So, no, we're seeing strong growth in both areas.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Youssef Squali \u2013 Jefferies & Company.\nYoussef Squali: You have lowered prices on Kindle, how should we be thinking about the driving force there? Did you get enough cost scale to still keep margins relatively unchanged or did you lower price to just increase penetration. And secondarily, on the affiliate question, as you've pulled back out of certain states, I think North Carolina, Rhode Island, and a few others, are there affiliates in other states or are you moving some of that money to other ROI channels, like search, etc. And which one has better ROI?\nThomas J. Szkutak: We use a number of different channels on the marketing side and we are just looking at what's the most effective way to make that spend and where do we think it drives incremental value to shareholders over time. And so that's not something new. There's no change there, from that perspective. And we use a number of different channels from a paid channel perspective. We also have our associates' channel as well, so there's not a lot new there from that perspective. And then in terms of Kindle, we certainly are getting better economies and given the growth on Kindle devices and we think that that's an appropriate price for customers and we think that it's certainly, given the growth that we're seeing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay \u2013 Sanford Bernstein.\nJeffrey Lindsay: Could you give us any sense of whether Zappos is going to be dilutive or accretive to earnings? And could you give us a sense of the post-merger integration planning for that acquisition and how we should think about it going forward, particularly if it is going to be dilutive to earnings. And second, could you tell us if you have any plans to take Kindle overseas?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of Zappos, we are extremely pleased with the announcement that we made yesterday and we are not discussing the dilutive or accretive nature of Zappos. I guess the way you should think about it is this. They had approximately $635.0 million worth of revenue last year. They had a small profit. And that would certainly be before any of the acquisition costs, which include intangible amortization as well as stock-based compensation, which would be post-acquisition. But in terms of integration, the way you should think about it is it's going to be a stand-alone business. We are very, very excited about the value that they bring to customers. It's very unique. We're very excited about helping that team build the brand and we think it's a unique brand and culture and it will be a great fit with Amazon. We think that it's a great way to grown our overall shoe and apparel business. And so we're very excited about it and we've got a great overall team, a great leadership team, and we were extremely happy to be able to make the announcement yesterday. In terms of Kindle international, it's certainly an opportunity. Customers have certainly expressed an interest and we have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we might do, but certainly it's clearly an opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: Could you talk a little bit more about just the strategic rationale behind Zappos and leaving it as an independent brand and company is a little bit of a department, I think, in terms of how you've historically grown your business under the Amazon brand. And secondarily, as part of that, even though it's going to be an independent unit within Amazon, are there any cost savings that we should be expecting, maybe from a fulfillment perspective?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Actually the way we're thinking about it is this. We have Zappos and 6PM which will join us. We have ShopUp, we have Endless, and we certainly have Amazon.com, all selling in soft lines. Shoes and apparel. And so we're very excited to have all those Web sites with\u2014if you take a look at those Web sites, they have many different brands, they have different customers, they have a different customer experience associated with each of them. So we're very excited to have all those. And from our standpoint, we're looking to learn from each other and we think that those categories are very interesting and we think there's a lot of growth opportunity and that's why we're doing that. So this is not an acquisition that we're talking about, you mentioned synergies. Certainly we'll be smart about it. If there are fulfillment centers that they have, if they have additional space, we'll certainly look to use that or if we have additional space that Zappos can use we certainly will look at those opportunities, but this is not about synergies, this about growing in categories that we think are very interesting and so we're very excited about it. I would also that this really isn't that much of a departure at all, or is not a departure at all. We've done a number of acquisitions over time. ShopUp, as I mentioned is one of those, is an acquisition that we did about three years that's in the same similar category. It's certainly in the soft lines. It's more of a fashion for women's apparel and shoes Web site and accessories. And we've also done a number of acquisitions as we look at some of our country launches, the last one was Joyo.com was our launch in China. So again, we've done a number of these. Our strategy as it relates to acquisitions hasn't changed. It's the same it's been for several years now. We start with a great fit and we were really pleased to be able to make the announcement yesterday.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal \u2013 Collins Stewart.\nSandeep Aggarwal: As e-Bay continues to transform its marketplace, what does that mean for Amazon? I know you already talked about Prime membership doing very well, but are you seeing signs of weakness in the new enrollment of Prime membership or any visible changes in the growth of third-party merchant enrollment?\nThomas J. Szkutak: We have launched a new practice of not talking about other companies, but in terms of our seller business, we had our, as I mentioned, third party units were 30% of total units, which is up over last year. Our sellers grew 21%, which is the fastest growth rate we've seen. In Q2 it was the fastest growth rate we've seen in many quarters. And our seller team has continued to focus on how to make that customer experience for our sellers as good as it possibly can be. FBA is an example of that. It's a great example where we provide services for sellers. It's great for customers because they get to get sellers use of our multi-no fulfillment network which allows them to get shipments using our super-saver shipping and Prime programs. So again, our seller team is continuously focused on trying to make that experience better and that\u2019s reflected in the metrics that you saw today that I mentioned, as well as the gross profit growth that we mentioned earlier as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Benjamin Schachter \u2013 Broadpoint AmTech.\nBenjamin Schachter: Could you discuss the private label that you're creating for some products and just discuss the strategic value there and any issues that may bring up with some of the 3-P partners. And also any update you may have on your used video game efforts. Could you discuss the private label that you're creating for some products and just discuss the strategic value there and any issues that may bring up with some of the 3-P partners. And also any update you may have on your used video game efforts.\nThomas J. Szkutak: We experimented in a number of different areas and we do have a small amount of private label product. I don't think there is a lot to talk to, but again, we are certainly doing some and we'll see what traction we get there. And the used video games, that's certainly one of the things, when you look at our total customer experience with video games, the team, as I mentioned, has done a great job of improving the customer experience over the past few years and that's just another example of one of the things that they've done.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Friedland \u2013 Cowen & Co.\nJames Friedland: Looking at the other line in North America sequentially, it showed some pretty good growth and I was wondering did that come from any of the cloud computing services. Are you seeing momentum there, or was that driven by marketing fees or something in that area?\nThomas J. Szkutak: There are a number of things that are going on there but certainly our Web services business is growing very nicely for us and that's reflected in those numbers.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Heath Terry \u2013 FBR Capital Markets.\nHeath Terry: You just mentioned that the Web services business was growing nicely. Can you give us an idea of which, if any, if there are any specific segments of the Web services business that are performing particularly well and when, looking at those on a stand-alone basis, where would you suggest we focus in terms of which ones you feel like have the  most potential long term to really contribute.\nRob Eldridge: We don't go down into specific service-related financials in this market, as you well know. But we're very, very happy with EC2C3 simple database. The entire suite of services. And we've been in the market now for three+ years with our paying customers, trying to deliver reliable, scalable, fast, flexible, responsive solutions to our developer base and we are going to continue to go do that.\nRob Eldridge: Thank you very much for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations Web site at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-04-24 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Amazon.com first quarter 2009 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks I will now turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge.\nRob Eldridge: Hello and welcome to our Q1 '09 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 23, 2009 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this web cast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12 month free cash flow grew 82% to $1.43 billion. Return on invested capital was 41%, up from 32%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock based awards outstanding was 447 million shares compared with 435 million. Worldwide revenue grew 18% to $4.89 billion or 25% excluding the $268 million unfavorable impact of year over year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $2.72 billion, up 7% or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $2.05 billion, up 38% or 46% excluding FX. World wide EGM increased to 42% of worldwide sales up from 26%. Worldwide unit growth was 30%. Active customer count exceeded 91 million, up 16%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.6 million, up 19%. Seller units were 32% of total units versus 30%. Worldwide gross profit was $1.15 billion, up 20%. Now we'll discuss operating expense excluding stock based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $826 million or 16.9% of sales, unchanged, year over year. Fulfillment was $407 million or 8.3% of revenue while tech and content was $239 million or 4.9% of revenue. Both were unchanged from the prior year. Marketing was $124 million or 2.5% of revenue, up 11 basis points from the prior year. Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock based compensation or the other operating expense income net line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $2.58 million. Media revenue grew 8% to $1.31 million. EGM grew 42% to $1.17 billion representing 45% of North America revenues up from 39%. North American gross profit grew 22% to $694 million and gross margin increased 18 basis points to 26.9% driven by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and the increase in 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 15% to $150 million, a 5.8% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 15% to $2.31 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusting for the $258 million year over year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 6% to $1.42 billion or 17% excluding FX and EGM revenue grew 44% to $874 million or 50% excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 38% of international revenues, up from 33%. International gross profit grew 17% to $454 million or grew 33% excluding foreign exchange rates while gross margin increased 36 basis points to 19.6% driven by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. International segment operating income increased 34% to $172 million, a 7.4% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from FX, international segment operating income increased 63%. CSOI grew 25% to $322 million or 6.6% of revenue, up 33 basis points year over year. Excluding the $32 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSUY grew 37%. Unlike CSOY, our GAAP operating income includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense/income. GAAP operating income grew 23% to $244 million or 5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $69 million in Q1 or a 28% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $177 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with $143 million and $0.34 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $579 million year over year to $2.73 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consists of cash, government and government agency securities triple A money market funds and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. During the quarter we redeemed the remaining 240 million Euros, $319 million based on the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate at date of redemption in principal of our 6.875% peaks. Inventory increased 18% to $1.27 billion and inventory turns were 12.5 down half a turn from the prior year as we expanded selection and improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 28% to $2.3 billion and accounts payable days increased to 57 from 53 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $295 million from a year ago to $889 million. Our Q1 2009 capital expenditures were $55 million. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including the high level of uncertainties on exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material affect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q2, we expect net sales between $4.3 billion and $4.75 billion on growth between 6% and 17%. This guidance anticipates approximately 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $110 million and $190 million or a decline between 49% and 12%. The second quarter of 2008 results include a $53 million non cash gain recognized from the sale of the company's European DVD assets. This includes approximately $90 million for stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets. We anticipated consolidate segment operating income which excludes stock based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $200 million and $280 million or between 18% decline and 14% growth. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time with some variability including some changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that, let's move to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Douglas Anmuth \u2013 Barclays Capital.\nDouglas Anmuth: Can you talk a little bit more about the Q2 guidance and in particular is there something that you're seeing early in the quarter that's making the outlook look a little bit lower than we would have expected versus the 1Q numbers particularly on the margin side?\nTom Szkutak: Our guidance from a revenue standpoint is growth of 6% to 17%. That's on a dollar basis, on a local currency basis that works out to be 13% to 24%. A few things to keep in mind; one, last year Q2 was our strongest growth quarter so if you take a look at the splits by quarter, last year we had 41% growth rate in Q2 or 35% growth rate on a local currency basis. We're overlapping that growth rate in the strongest quarter. The other thing to keep in mind on the top line as well, smaller impacts, but certainly Easter was in Q1 last year last year and Q2 this year, so we had that benefit in Q1 and will be overlapping that in Q2. Also, as I mentioned from an exchange standpoint, the 700 basis points is more than you saw in Q1, so again those are the impacts on the top line. So that's why the high end of the range works out to be 24% which is a little bit lower than we came in for Q1. So that translates down into a lower operating income. The other thing to keep in mind too is as you look at our Q2, seasonally, Q2 is our lowest quarter from a revenue perspective which means with that top line you get a little bit less leverage, particularly the fixed operating costs. So that's reflected in the guidance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Mitchell \u2013 Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: The question is about improvements in gross margin year on year in the first quarter. Were there any unusual gross margin influences other than our old friends inventory management, product mix, lower prices?\nTom Szkutak: Those are the big piece of inventory management. We worked well with vendors in terms of getting vendor savings. An example would be something that we've been working on for a number of quarters but certainly working with them to ship when they have shipments, to ship in bulk to the nearest fulfillment center. The benefit to that is a way to share some of those savings for them shipping to the closest facility and then we get to optimize taking that larger bulk shipment and optimizing that in our network. But certainly inventory vendor management savings and also third party growth were certainly key factors and those were partially offset by lower prices to customers. Question Were digital sales an impact or not?\nJeffrey Bezos: Digital sales, are you referring to Kindle sales or all digital? Digital is certainly part of the numbers. The key thing to keep in mind as you think about Kindle specifically from a device standpoint, we recognize that in the month following shipment over a two year period. We amortize that over a two year period.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel \u2013 Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: It's probably hard to break out but maybe a qualitative view; I'm curious how much of your core infrastructure that you've been building the last couple of years is being redeployed in other business initiatives such as FPA and AWS that are maybe contributing to the operating profit line. Is there any way to quantify that what the contribution looks like to CSOI at the end of the day some of your newer initiatives in terms of leverage the fixed assets and costs that you've built out over the years. Second question is can you characterize how much down sizing and retrenching that online and offline that retailers are doing out there in the landscape is impacting your business positively or in general as it relates as you go after customers or consumers as well as just talking to your suppliers.\nJeffrey Bezos: The first part of your question, just to talk about how we think about the overall infrastructure both from a operations as well as infrastructure capacity standpoint, the retail part of our business we plan for peak and so when you think about fulfillment capacity, we're certainly planning for peak which is in December. Our infrastructure supports our retail business. We also plan for peak as well, so some of the things that you're seeing with FBA as well as web services, we're not looking at it as a way to use our existing infrastructure. We're looking at them as separately standing businesses and we look at the economics that way as well. Could you repeat the second part of your question?\nJeetil Patel: Just trying to understand online and offline retailers shrink their business growth spending out there. How much of an impact is that having or opportunity is that as you go after customers as well as go after better supplier terms out there?\nJeffrey Bezos: I apologize. I don't think I can help you much with that one. I would just answer the first one, we use the same, for example fulfillment by Amazon inventory is co-mingled with our Amazon owned inventory in the same fulfillment center. So in that respect we're leveraging those fixed investment, but there's not excess capacity that we can, we're building new capacity both for Amazon owned inventory and new capacity for FDA, but it is comingled inventory. Same thing for web services. When you look at our data centers, the Amazon retail services and web services that we offer through infrastructure computing like EC2 and S3, those are co-mingled in the same data centers as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney \u2013 Citi.\nMark Mahaney: Jeff, in your shareholder letter you referred to Mooda or waste, the Japanese word for waste and you talked about being able to, seeing it in a lot of different places and a lot of potential. Could you maybe bring it down to financial terms for us and where do you think you have your best opportunity to get at that waste and where we would see it maybe show up or are we already seeing it in terms of some of those CapEx efficiencies? CapEx spending seems to be nicely contained. And then secondly on marketing spend, is there any particular reason why you're not seeing a little bit more efficiency in marketing spend given what seems to be pretty clear deflationary trends in online display or search advertising?\nJeffrey Bezos: On the Mooda point, this is very encouraging for me and very energizing for me that every where we look and every team here looks. When we look we find that we are doing every operation that we do in some optimal way. So we've gotten better every year but we still have a lot of progress that we can make. And that's encouraging because it means that we can get variable, we believe we can get variable and fixed productivity for a long time to come. So that's the opportunity. I don't know how to quantify that for you. Every time we go through our planning process we do set top down targets for variable and fixed productivity and we try to work towards those to make sure that we're being frugal and efficient so that we can have a cost structure that supports the customer experience that we want to have which is have the lowest prices. So that's something that we take very seriously and as I said, it's very, very energizing for me to see how much opportunity there is there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post \u2013 Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Some people measure Google's paid clicks versus revenues as a measure of the recession impact. When I look at your revenues versus your units, 30% units, 25% revenues, does that 5% maybe relate to ASP's or is there a mix issue or shift going on? Your shipping revenue was down 1% year over year. Does that have any indication on prime adoption and then the other revenue in the U.S., the gross there, were there some interesting things going on last year that maybe have stopped and can we read anything into your web services adoption based on that number?\nJeffrey Bezos: From a mix standpoint, the one thing that we are seeing certainly is higher priced items are still growing but certainly not growing as much as they were a few quarters ago. So that's one of the impacts that you're seeing. Keep in mind when you look at our business, given the selection that we have in the categories that we're in, you do see certainly some variation by quarter in terms of the mix just because of the sheer amount of the selection that we have. In terms of the shipping revenue, there's no question that we're seeing a good adoption of prime and certainly free shipping and that's certainly impacting that revenue line item. And that's a trend that you've been seeing back to our prior quarters. That's something that you've been seeing for awhile. In terms of your last portion of the revenues, there's a number of things that go in that line item and as we've talked about in previous calls it can tend to be a little lumpy from quarter to quarter. But again, there's a large number of things that go in there and so as we've described in other quarters.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Devitt \u2013 Morgan Stanley.\nScott Devitt: I wanted to touch on vendor pricing if I could and ask it a different way. I was wondering if you're seeing any significant differences by category, possibly in areas where there's more significant retail disruption, and then also if you could comment on the sustainability of these vendor pricing improvements in all economic environments. You mentioned getting product to different fulfillment centers. That seems sustainable. I'm interested as well if there's vendor pricing that is just driven by the general disruption in the channel and whether the relevance on the business model can sustain that as the economy improves.\nThomas Szkutak: There's not a lot of help on the vendor pricing side. We continue to work with our partners in all of the categories that we're in geographically. Certainly the way you should think about it is we think that there's room over time to work with our partners to get better prices over the long term. Certainly the categories that we've been in the longest, there are still opportunities, but when you think about magnitude in terms of basis points, I would think t here would be more opportunity in the categories that we've been in the shortest amount of time. That's the way I would think about it. In terms of what it could look like going forward, we certainly had healthy amount of savings in Q1 as reflected in the gross margins that you see and what we believe is certainly reflected in our Q2 guidance, but we'll continue to work over certainly a long period of time to try to get better, work better with suppliers to get better savings.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay \u2013 Sanford Bernstein.\nJeffrey Lindsay: Did you have a specific push on fulfillment by Amazon or was that demand driven? And could you give us an indication about margins on that business and where you're booking it exactly. Is it all going into other or is it spread across the product categories?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of FBA this is something that we've been doing for not long but again over the last several quarters and it's continued to build. I wouldn't call it any specific push. It's certainly something that we're offering to sellers. We think it's a very good experience for sellers so that they can take advantage of our multi-net fulfillment network in the U.S. and our fulfillment networks outside of the U.S. So we think that that's a great opportunity. It comes in a number of different forms in terms of the revenue. Certainly the third party revenue that you see would come in the individual categories which is certainly the largest piece, and obviously we're recording the operating expense associated with those fulfillment services in our fulfillment line item.\nJeffrey Bezos: I'll add to that just to say that one of the things that's driving the uptake of fulfillment by Amazon is that sellers have the opportunity to drive up their sales when they switch to fulfillment by Amazon in large part because of the interaction between fulfillment by Amazon and Amazon Prime. So as soon as a seller switches to using fulfillment by Amazon, all of their products become eligible for Amazon Prime just as if they were Amazon owned items. So the interaction between those two programs is driving sales for sellers and that is something of course that sellers want. That's in large part what is driving the uptake of fulfillment by Amazon.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: I was wondering about the media line. That's been decelerating. Is there anything, I know FX was impacted by the international, was there anything going on there beyond just the category. And then on a related matter is media as a category as you transition to digital, could you maybe talk a little bit about Amazon DOD and how you plan on differentiating that going forward?\nJeffrey Bezos: If you take a look at our international media and our media growth in general, we saw North America, we saw an 8% growth which is consistent with what we saw in Q4. Q4 was just slightly less that 7% and then in international on a local currency basis, it was 17% which was down a little bit from Q3. It was 22%. And again, you saw our total revenue, if you go back to Q4 for international, was 31% on a local currency basis, so it was really consistent with what we saw in the first three quarters of the year. We saw that dip a little bit and we believe that was economic related in Q1 to 28%, but still very solid growth, 28% in total for our international businesses on a local currency basis. So we did see a little bit of decline in international media, but we saw a corresponding increase in ETM also growing 50% on a local currency basis. The Amazon video on demand team is doing a terrific job. The strategy is very simple, which is to keep improving the customer experience of video on demand relentlessly as we go forward and at the same time to make it very easy for partners to integrate the video on demand service into their set top box or video display device. So again, today you can use video on demand, Amazon video on demand very seamlessly on TIVO and also on the ROC2 box, so continuing to do those kinds of integrations is an important part of the strategy of making those integrations easy for our partners.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal \u2013 Collins Stewart.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Obviously Kindle both generation one and generation two of Kindle did very well. Any plan to unleash the computing power of Kindle and let it compete with uniform factors like Net book which are gaining traction now?\nJeffrey Bezos: We're really focused on purposeful reading devices and so we wouldn't talk anyway about what we might do in the future, but I can tell you that we're really focused on devices with electronic displays that are purpose built for reading. Kindle 2 really is a terrific long form reading device and we think reading is an important enough activity that it deserves a purpose built device and that's really a sweet spot for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Marianne Wolk \u2013 Susquehanna.\nMarianne Wolk: Can you update us on your cloud computing business and any initiatives of larger corporate accounts that you've been successful with. Also in the past you disclosed a number of web developers in your solution as nearly 400,000. Can you provide any update to that figure? And you reduced capacity earlier this quarter which appeared minor and head count fell by about 100 sequentially, can you comment whether these are cost control efforts and describe any other specific cost reduction initiatives in place that are helping margins.\nThomas Szkutak: Examples of enterprise customers using our infrastructure web services today, there are many but I'll name a few; Eli Lilly doing basic research, clinical trial analysis using UC2. ESPN is another user of UC2. Auto Desk is a user of UC2. There are many more, some of them preferred not to be identified for competitive reasons. A number of hedge funds using UC2 for compute, so I'll just leave it at that. But there is good traction in the enterprise customer set as well of course there is with start up small business and medium business. In terms of your other question related to head count, it's pretty flat. Q1 head count was pretty flat with year end. We did continue to hire but we also had attrition as well, so it remained pretty flat. In terms of other productivity, we have a large number of things that we're working on from a productivity standpoint. I talked about some of them earlier. We continue to work with suppliers to find ways where we can make them more successful as well as us more successful. One of the ways that we like, Jeff talked about some of the efforts we have earlier in Mark's question and one of the ways we spend a lot of time on is to get productivity is by becoming more efficient for customers. We find that the many, many programs that we have, as they become more efficient for customers, translates into a better experience for customers, but it also results in productivity. So we have many, many different programs across the company. This is not something new. This is something we've been working on for quite a few years and as Jeff described earlier, we have a lot of opportunity to continue to work on those going forward as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Youssef Squali \u2013 Jefferies & Company.\nYoussef Squali: If I look at the segment breakouts and I look at your electronics and other in the U.S. there was a noticeable reacceleration of that business. Growth was at 42%. Can you help us understand why the reacceleration? Were there any sub categories that performed exceptionally well or better than your expectations? Back to the Amazon VOD, what would be the hurdles to allowing Amazon to move into a subscription model in addition to the current offering that you already have?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of electronics and other general merchandise we did see strong growth in North America. We also saw strong growth in international, and it was we continue to add selection and those categories, we continue to improve our in stock level so that when customers came to our VOD to order it was available right away for shipment. And pricing was very, very competitive, so we think the combination of certainly prices, adding additional selections in stock and certainly fast delivery with prime helping those numbers as well.\nJeffrey Bezos: In answer to the video on demand subscription, there's nothing structural that would prohibit that. The amount of selection that you have available in a subscription model today is much less than what you can get with a la carte model. So that's the beginnings of an answer to your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets.\nColin Sebastian: I was hoping to get your perspective on some of the regional and national initiatives to impose sales taxation on the internet. For example, what you might expect to see in terms of any impact on demand perhaps from a historical perspective.\nJeffrey Bezos: It's hard to say. There's not a lot I can help you with there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Imran Khan \u2013 J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan: I think some of the retail companies and some of the online retailers also talked about business conditions stabilization are improving. Your business was not impacted that much by the economy. Can you give us sense, have you seen some sign of improvement in your growth as we focused at the end of the quarter. And third party business is growing at a faster pace and becoming a bigger part of the business. The challenge is I think you are extremely focused on improving user experience. As third party becomes a bigger part of the business, how close are you monitoring the users for consumer satisfaction and how do you guarantee that consumer gets the same satisfaction as when they buy from Amazon when Amazon is the principal?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of growth rate, it's obviously difficult to say what the economic impact is but we certainly starting Q4 by looking at our overall growth rates we saw solid growth rates but not as strong as we saw for the several quarters previous to that and you saw the same thing again in Q1. So our Q1 revenue growth was 25% on a local currency basis, but last year in the first three quarters, it was well into the 30's and so we did see some slow down both in Q4 and in Q1. But we're not doing anything different than we've done in the past. We continue to focus on what we think are the right things for customers and that's what we're doing. So it's hard to say what the economic impact is.\nJeffrey Bezos: On the third party sales business question, how do we guarantee the customer experience in that third party model, there are a couple of ways. One, we maintain score cards on the sellers and the sellers are very interested in self improvement. The fact of the matter is, the vast majority of sellers do a very good job fulfilling for customers and the small fraction that do not, we can provide them feedback and we can ultimately ask them not to sell on Amazon. The second thing we do is we have the AZ guarantee so ultimately we can take care of customers if the seller cannot. And then third, we have fulfillment by Amazon so fulfillment by Amazon really levels the experience and makes it so that those third parties sold items have exactly the same fulfillment and customer service experience as Amazon owned inventory.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Heath Terry \u2013 FBR Capital Markets.\nHeath Terry: Given that third party this quarter was 32%, that's a number that's been surprising stable for awhile and given the growth that you're obviously seeing to some degree in third party in Europe. Can you give us a sense of where you feel like the right balance for that is and to the extent that you're willing to talk about the difference in where you are with third party as a percentage of your units in the U.S. or as a percentage of orders in the U.S. versus Europe and what level do you see that balancing out?\nJeffrey Bezos: Ultimately the customers can decide what that mix ends up being and what we're trying to do is make sure we have a great customer experience. Certainly for our consumers we continue to work as well on our sellers which is another customer set that we have and so the way you should think about it is we're trying to make those two experiences as well as our third customer set which is developers. In terms of mix, the customer is ultimately going to decide and what we're trying to do is make that experience as good as we can make it and so that the customers will decide who they buy from. We haven't disclosed what the numbers are for each of the two segments but looking at Q1, both segments are growing nicely.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Friedland \u2013 Cohen & Company.\nJames Friedland: I was wondering if you could give us any color on what's going on with the asset in China in terms of how big is it at this point or if you can give us some sort of comparison of what it looks like compared to Amazon. When did it become a material part of the business?\nJeffrey Bezos: We haven't split out the specific geography numbers but we're very pleased with the business we have in China. It's growing nicely and we think that it's an interesting long term opportunity for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster: If you could talk a little bit about Prime and the overall percentage of products on Prime right now. I know you talked about some of Amazon and how do you basically fulfill and promote more products being offered by Prime. And can you talk a little bit about behavior when people actually sign up for Prime, just general difference in how people's behavior changes once they become Prime.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of selection we have very vast selection in Prime and so it's just a very good experience for customers and we continue to add to that selection. We continued to add selections back in Q1. We'll continue to add selection in the coming quarters for our Prime customers. We're seeing customers do a lot more cross shopping than they have previously and so it's a very good experience for customers. It's certainly impacting the growth rates that you're seeing not only this quarter but the last several quarters so it's a very good experience for customers.\nJeffrey Bezos: When Tom talks about Prime section growing, it is millions of different items and it is across all categories so you can use your Prime membership to buy shoes, to buy food, to buy diapers, to buy media products and electronics and so on. But it's across a wide array of categories and growing every day.\nRob Eldridge: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website until the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}], "2011": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2010, "date": "2011-01-28 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Amazon Quarterly Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.\nRobert Eldridge: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 27, 2011 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about the factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Szkutak: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 6% to $3.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 14% to $2.52 billion. Return on invested capital was 34%, down from 66%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by the average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 461 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 36% to $12.95 billion or 37%, excluding the $139 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection of free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime. Media revenue increased to $5.23 billion, up 12% or 13%, excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $7.39 billion, up 60% or 62%, excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 48%. Worldwide unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 130 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 30% of total units. Consolidated gross profit grew 33% to $2.63 billion and gross margin was 20.3%. Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $2.01 billion or a 15.5% of sales, up 101 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.06 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 7.7%. Tech and Content was $456 million or 3.5% of revenue compared with 3.1%. Marketing was $368 million or 2.8% of revenue, consistent with prior year. Now we'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $7.21 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.37 billion. EGM revenue grew 71% to $4.56 billion, representing 63% of North America revenues, up from 54%. North America segment operating income increased 6% to $295 million, a 4.1% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 26% to $5.74 billion. Revenue growth was 29%, adjusting for the $143 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 11% to $2.87 billion or 13% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 46% to $2.83 billion or 50%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 49% of international revenues, up from 43%.  International segment operating income increased 3% to $327 million, a 5.7% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 16%. CSOI grew 4% to $622 million, or 4.8% of revenue, down 146 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $18 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI grew 7%. Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was relatively flat at $474 million or 3.7% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $84 million in Q4 or 17% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $416 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared with $384 million and $0.85 per diluted share. Now I'll discuss full year results. Revenue grew 40% to $34.2 billion. North America revenue grew 45% to $18.71 billion, and International grew 33% to $15.5 billion, 34% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI grew 23% to $1.94 billion or 25%, excluding $28 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin decreased 75 basis points to 5.7%. GAAP operating income grew 25% to $1.41 billion or 4.1% of net sales. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $8.76 billion. Inventory increased 48% to $3.2 billion, and inventory turns were 11.4, down from 12.2 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved the in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 44% to $8.05 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 68 in the prior year. Our Q4 2010 capital expenditures were $328 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we've described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q1 2011, we expect net sales of between $9.1 billion and $9.9 billion, a growth of between 28% to 39%. This guidance anticipates approximately 140 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $260 million and $385 million or between 34% decline and 2% decline. This includes approximately $140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, but we anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $400 million to $525 million or between 21% decline and 4% growth. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.\nRobert Eldridge: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on with the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.\nMark Mahaney: First, on the gross margin trends, down a little bit year-over-year. Would that have been impacted by the strong sale of Kindle devices in the fourth quarter? And second, could you just talk broadly about the Subscribe and Save offering that you have and to what extent you've seen cross selling into more consumer-staple items amongst your customer base?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of gross margins. You are seeing some volatility to look at the individual quarters from 2010. You saw that we were down a bit in Q1, up the next two quarters slightly and then down a little bit in Q4, about approximately 45 basis points. And we haven't been talking much more on the gross margins because we don't think it's that meaningful, and that's what we're trying to point people to the bottom again. And the reason we're doing that is because of the mix of business. And so what you're seeing there in gross margins in Q4 is we have a very broad mix of businesses and geographies that are going into that number. And again, you're seeing some volatility in the individual quarters. But again, we're very pleased with what we saw in Q4 in terms of growth and overall performance of the business. And it reflects a very heavy investment load to support the growth that we expect. In terms of the Subscribe and Save, could you repeat the question again?\nMark Mahaney: What kind of impact had you seen or what kind of adoption rate have you seen for that and just broadly, your penetration, what kind of consumer staple spending amongst the Amazon customer base?\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. Subscribe and Save is going very well. It's something that certainly customers like a lot. And we're getting that benefit in the consumer portion of the consumer category today, again, it's something that we're excited about and customers are excited about, so we're happy to offer it to them.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: Just two questions about revenue growth, and I don't want to sound critical of revenue growth because obviously, growth rate's very high. But just picking into two components. First of all, is there any big obvious reason why international growth decelerated while the domestic growth accelerated? And then secondly, in the Media business, if e-book sales are now bigger than paperback sales and paperback sales continue to grow, is there a big obvious reason why total media sales is growing at 13% rather than a slightly faster number? I assume that the agency accounting for e-books is part of that, perhaps?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of overall growth, we are very pleased with what we saw, just kind of frame up that discussion a bit. We saw 40% growth year-over-year total year 2010, which is the best growth rate we've seen since 2000. We saw Q4 growth rate overall of 37% on local-currency basis, which matches our best growth rate for any Q4 we've had on a local-currency basis since 2000. And then unit growth was 43%, which certainly going back several years, we haven't seen any quarter that's had that growth. So we're seeing very strong growth across many categories, across many geographies. In terms of the international growth specifically, if you look back to last year, we did have very strong media growth in international in Q4. You'll see that it's up 26% on a local-currency basis, which is one of the strongest quarters we've had, and we're overlapping that. There were some new releases that were in Q4 last year. Most notably, the Windows 7 release one, Dan Brown's book in Germany is other, those are a few examples, but there are a few releases that were in there. The other piece to that we haven't -- certainly difficult to quantify but there was certainly some impact from some of the weather that we saw in Europe during the month of December. But again, we're very pleased with the growth that we saw in Q4 in total, including international, and we're happy with what we see there. In terms of some of your questions surrounding media. Again, we are seeing good growth there. As you mentioned, we're seeing, so far, quarter date this quarter, we saw that Kindle books exceeded paperbacks, which is very exciting and while having paperbacks continue to grow, year-over-year. So again, we're seeing very strong growth there. So again, we're pleased with the growth we're seeing across the business.\nJames Mitchell: Is there a track on the media growth from the accounting of the agency e-books?\nThomas Szkutak: Could you say that again?\nJames Mitchell: Is the fact that some of the e-books are being sold on an agency rather than on a consignment basis, this year is that acting as a drag on growth temporarily, in terms of your reported revenue?\nThomas Szkutak: Certainly, the agency piece is included in the numbers that we reported today. But in terms of the impact, we're not breaking that out. But again, we're very excited with the growth that we're seeing within books, e-books specifically and physical books are going well as well.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: First, Tom, for the first quarter guidance, it would seem like your operating income guidance implies that you are still reinvesting in the business. Could you just give us a little bit more color on is it still fulfillment centers? Is it tech and content, all of the above? And secondly, with the Lovefilm's acquisition, can you just walk us through the rationale and how you'll integrate that with perhaps your other video-on-demand businesses?\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the guidance, let me just put that in context. And probably the best way to do it is just again a reminder on 2010. The fact that we had very strong growth, the best growth we've seen in 10 years. Fourth quarter matched the best, on a local-currency basis growth, matched the best fourth quarter we've had since 2000. And again, very strong unit growth and the best we've seen. With all that growth, we had to add a lot of capacity, most of which was in the second half of last year. We added fulfillment capacities for the corner retail business. We added fulfillment capacities to support our growing fulfilled by Amazon business was part of our seller business. We added a lot of infrastructure capacity to support our fast-growing AWS business, as well as our retail business. So those reflected, when you look at our Q4 results and our 2010 results, those are reflected in the CapEx numbers that you're seeing, and those are reflected in the fulfillment as well as the tech and content lines when you look at our operating expense line items. And so because it was largely back half of the year loaded, you're seeing more of that in Q1. So those are reflected in the growth rate. Now the question will be we're not giving guidance beyond Q1, but what will this mean going forward? And so one of the things that we're doing is certainly, when you look at our Q1 guidance, you look at our topline guidance, we're cautiously optimistic about Q1, in a very strong growth. And we'll have to see how much we invest throughout the year in 2011 based on that. But again, I'm very, very happy with the capital we're able to deploy. You should keep in mind that with the sheer amount of capacity that we added in 2010, it doesn't become, it's not fully utilized day 1 and we don't get the optimum productivity on day 1. So what that means is we get productivity on those operations. We get returns on those assets that we deploy over a period of time. But if you look at our history, we've gotten very good returns on that capital. And so to me, I'm very pleased to put that capital in place. And if we have to add more in 2011, it will be a high-quality problem.\nSpencer Wang: And on Lovefilms?\nThomas Szkutak: Lovefilm, we think it's just a very exciting opportunity. We've had a close association with that business for some time. We're very pleased to be able to offer customers the media space within Europe they're offering. So again we're very excited about it, and you have to stay tuned on that one.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Doug Anmuth with Barclays Capital.\nDouglas Anmuth: First, I just wanted to ask in terms of the revenue growth that you're expecting for 1Q, can you give us a sense of how much you're anticipating from acquisitions? And then secondly, if you could comment just on your thinking around the living social investment and also what you may have learned from the recent daily offer which you ran within the last week or so?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the guidance for Q1, specifically in terms of acquisitions, the Lovefilm or Quidsi, which haven't closed yet are not reflected in guidance. So those are not in our Q1 numbers. In terms of living social, we're very pleased with the investment that we've made there. In terms of any commentary on the recent deal, the recent one-day offer that they had. We're very excited that they offered Amazon gift certificates, and we think it's great for customers and we're happy they've enabled that.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS.\nBrian Pitz: First, an update on AWS. It looks like other revenue in North America slowed pretty significantly and I realized that's a decent part of Other. Any commentary on what was the main driver of that slower growth? And second, on Grocery, can you give us a little more insight on your initiatives there and the potential cost impact from expanding this category?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of AWS, we're extremely pleased with how AWS is going. It's growing at a very fast rate. We're investing in that business to support that growth rate. You're correct, in terms of seeing the North America Other growth rate drop from 52% to 45% year-over-year from Q3 to Q4. Keep in mind that there's a number of things in there including AWS that tend to be a little lumpy. But we did see actually an acceleration of growth in AWS from Q3 to Q4. So built into that number, it actually accelerated. So again we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing there. In terms of Grocery, we have two things that you probably could be referring to. One is our Drygoods business, which is within our Consumer business that we're very pleased with that we have on Amazon.com, as well as some other sites. In addition to that, we have a local test here in Seattle called Amazon Fresh. Again, that is a test that we've been conducting. We're pleased with how the test is going. But again, it's a test and we'll continue to see how that goes and see if we invest further on that test. Again, we do a number of tests in different parts of our business and that happens to be one of them. We have a great team that's working on it, but you'll have to stay tuned to see if we do more there.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Youssef Squali with Jefferies.\nYoussef Squali: Tom, can you tell us how many distribution centers you actually had at the end of 2010? I know you're not going to guide to 2011. But since you're guiding to Q1, are you planning opening on any distribution centers, and what's your CapEx for Q1?\nThomas Szkutak: We had approximately 52 at the end of 2010. We added 13 last year. We will add more fulfillment centers this year. We haven't said, we weren't saying how many yet because again we're trying to determine what the growth rate will be. And based on what we've seen in Q1, we're certainly cautiously optimistic which is reflected in the growth rate you see for guidance for Q1. So we'll have to wait and see, and we'll be back with you as we go throughout the year. But just to be clear, again, I've mentioned in one of the other questions that I think would be a very high-quality problem. And the reason why I say that is what our teams are doing around the world right now, which is the same thing we've been doing for the last 15 or 16 years in working with our various fulfillment centers is even though we're not fully utilized in some of these new assets that we deployed in 2010 or our productivity is not optimum, that team will work to utilize those assets. As we continue to grow, we'll get better and better productivity as we go, just like we have in our other fulfillment centers around the world that we've had experience with. So we're very excited about that. And so when you think about the fulfillment centers, even though they can be a little bit dilutive in the short term by looking at our fulfillment expense, the reason why I'm very excited about is that you can just look at our return on invested capital. If you take our return on invested capital at the end of 2010, we had approximately $7.4 billion of invested capital. That's a 5-point average over the last five quarters. If you take out cash and marketable securities over the same period, that's about $6.5 billion. So we have about $900 million of invested capital. And even with our heavier spend in CapEx last year, we generated $2.5 billion of cash flow. So we have an excess of 250% of return on our invested capital x cash and marketable securities. And so again, that's a full business. It includes a lot of things over a period of time. But if you think about that capacity where we need it because of growth, we're certainly very happy. We do it judiciously and make sure we do it appropriately. But very happy to deploy that capital to get great returns for shareholders over time. And again, the returns that we've gotten are certainly historical, not predictive. But again, we're very happy to deploy that capital, and I feel very good about it.\nYoussef Squali: Are you quantifying CapEx for Q1?\nThomas Szkutak: No, we haven't quantified the CapEx for Q1, I apologize. But again, we will do what we need to do to support the growth in both the infrastructure and fulfillment.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Colin Sebastian with Lazard Capital Markets.\nColin Sebastian: One follow up on the gross margins. I think historically, Amazon's pricing philosophy has been to be a price follower. And I guess I'm curious if perhaps you're loosening that strategy up a bit, maybe to be a price leader in more categories?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of pricing, we've had a number of different strategies over the course of our history. But certainly, our objective is to have great values for customers over all of our selection, over all of our geographies, and that hasn't changed. And so we're very excited to offer customers that. It's a reason, certainly one of the drivers for the growth that we've been able to have over our history. And so one of the things that we do, do is when we enter a new category and add selection within that category, we price it day 1 as competitively as we can. So in other words, we price it competitively day 1 based on the intelligence we have. And sometimes that means it's a very low gross margin because we're just entering those particular categories with those particular items. And that's something we've been consistently doing for a number of years, and we like that strategy.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.\nBenjamin Schachter: There's a lot of interest in how the Kindle ecosystem actually impacts the margin. I was wondering if you could just help us understand, the one question would be all-in Kindle hardware and software, the whole thing together, how is that impacting gross margin? And then overall, how should we think about how the agency model and the e-books how that's going to impact margin? And then just one quick one. There's been some speculation about the potential to bundle services with Amazon Prime. I was wondering if you could tell us how you think about that and if that's something that may be interesting in the future?\nThomas Szkutak: First off, we have a long-standing practice of not breaking out any individual products or categories. But what I can say about Kindle is it's growing very fast. We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing. We sold millions of devices in Q4. The content business, the content part of it is growing very fast as evidenced by some of the comments we put in the earnings release. .So far quarter-to-date this quarter again Q1, we have Kindle content, Kindle book sales growing at a faster rate than paperbacks, which is really exciting. And so that business is going very well. And with the opportunity that we see there, we're continuing to invest in that business. We think it's a very good business for us, and we're excited about the long-term opportunity there.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Maybe you could explain why Kindle is a better business for Amazon? And then secondly, you talked about gross margin maybe not being the best way to measure the company, maybe you could explain why operating margin is better? And do you have individual management targets as far as compensation or as a company as a whole and where you want to get to for operating margins?\nThomas Szkutak: I'm not sure I understood the first part of your question related to Kindle.\nJustin Post: I guess I'm asking why Kindle is a better business than your traditional book-selling media business?\nThomas Szkutak: Well, we happen to like both. Even though we're extremely excited about our Kindle business, our physical book business continues to grow as well. And so we're very excited about both parts of our business. And again we think, when I was mentioning Kindle, we just think it's a great opportunity for us. It has great tracks right now. Customers like it. We're able to offer so many titles right now on less than 60 seconds right to for a customer to be able to read. And one of the things you can't do with a physical book is you can't, from a service perspective with our model, it's very difficult to get it to a customer now. And with Kindle, we can do that in less than 60 seconds. You can carry around your library with you very lightly, and so we think it's just great for customers, and we're seeing that the growth, both in terms of devices and content, is just fantastic. And so we're continuing to invest and continue to improve that experience for customers. In terms of gross margins versus operating margins, we actually don't focus a lot on individual percentages, whether it be gross margins or operating margins. We're focused on ultimately over the long term on free cash flow, free cash flow per share. We like to look at our return on invested capital. I mentioned earlier what our return on invested capital is today. That includes appropriately so the cash and marketable securities that we have in that balance. But certainly, if you were to deploy that cash and return that to shareholders over time, you can see the underlying returns on invested capital x cash are very high and in excess of 250% right now. And so we think it's a very efficient capital business, and we think that we certainly like the model that we have and the opportunity that it brings to our shareholders over the long term.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.\nJeetil Patel: First of all, I guess when you look at the Kindle side of the equation, do you believe that the proliferation of Kindle apps across devices, not just your own device, is helping to increase the overall consumption of books across the industry or Amazon? And then second, I guess as it relates to international, where do you stand in terms of Pan-European fulfillment capabilities, say shipping from Germany into the Netherlands into Scandinavia, et cetera?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of Kindle apps, we think it's good for customers that they can read their Kindle books on their Kindle, as well as many other devices. And so that's what you see today. We have these apps so that it's easy for customers to be able to do that. Customers like that feature, and you should expect us to continue to expand that over time. So how much is it contributing to overall growth? It's hard to say. But again, customers are responding to the vast selection that we have, the great prices we have for Kindle content, the ease of which they can carry it around with them with the great convenience on the device, the Kindle device itself, so we're very excited about it. In terms of fulfillment. We continue to work with our fulfillment to make it as seamless as possible for customers. That's really what it's all about in each of the geographies we're in, and we'll continue to do so. So wherever we can make that service within Europe, better for customers, we will. It will come from whatever fulfillment center makes sense.\nJeetil Patel: You've had tremendous growth in customers over the past year, about 24 million or so. Do you think that your lifetime kind of value of the customer equation has changed? Particularly as you looked at you have initiatives like Kindle and Prime. Do you think that the economics have changed, obviously, for the better that you're acquiring more aggressively? Is that how we should think about some of these newer initiatives that you've had over the last several years that have been certainly been pretty impactful?\nThomas Szkutak: No, I think, not commenting on the lifetime value of customers. But we continue to offer new things for customers to make the experience better for customers. So we're adding new selection to make that better for customers. We launched Prime a number of years ago which continues to grow because we want to make sure that we give great service to customers. Many of our digital initiatives are around how do we make sure we get customers, not only creating great price and great selection but they get to have their content immediately. And so those are the things -- that is always -- with us, we start with the customer first. That's where our focus is. We found that by aligning with the customer, it's been great for customers as well as great for shareholders over time. So that's the focus that we've had and the driver behind the initiatives over the past several years.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company.\nJames Friedland: Question on marketing.  If we look at marketing as a percentage of revenues this year, it was up and I believe you said one of the main reasons was the inclusion of Zappos. And as we think about your marketing spend in 2011, is that the sort of seasonality and pattern that we should look for or is anything changing in your approach to marketing?\nThomas Szkutak: Well, certainly we added, continued to support the Zappos marketing spend in 2010. That was a part of it. We're always looking for ways to reach customers through our marketing spend. We also did, you'd probably noticed a fair amount of Kindle ads during 2010, primarily starting for the most part heavier after Q1 of last year, which we saw a great response to. So again those are some of the dynamics to think about.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Steve Weinstein with Pacific Quest.\nSteve Weinstein: Question on Prime membership. Now that it's been active in the U.S. for quite a long time now, are you still seeing new members adopting Prime at a rapid rate? And I'm wondering when you think that may plateau as far as penetration in terms of it, the existing customer base?\nThomas Szkutak: We are seeing adoption of Prime in our geographies. It continued to grow nicely, and customers like Prime. They like that service element of Prime. We have different offerings, depending on the geography that we're offering it in. In the U.S., you can get express two-day shipping for free, you get one day and also some other offers, in terms of weekend offers as well. So again, there's some interesting service element to that. And customers are responding very well to it, both existing Prime members as well as new Prime members. So it's going very well.\nSteve Weinstein: I guess I'm asking, I mean do you think you're reaching any sort of ceiling, in terms of how many U.S....\nThomas Szkutak: No. And again, hard to tell when that would happen, but that's certainly not what we're experiencing.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Heath Terry with Canaccord.\nHeath Terry: I was wondering if you could give us a sense, is there a way to quantify the amount of time necessary for the recently opened distribution facilities to get to the same utilization level that you're seeing in the rest of the business? And what kind of impact do you think that has on operating margins to the extent that you can kind of quantify that for us? And in light of the investments in this quarter, I guess it's worth at least asking if you still feel like 10% is the right long-term operating margin to be thinking about for the whole business?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of when the fulfillment centers will reach their optimum utilization and productivity, we're still getting productivity on existing fulfillment centers that we've had for quite some time. So it'll be something that will evolve over a longer period of time. But again, if you look at the returns that we've gotten on the previous fulfillment centers that we've launched, they have been great uses of capital. So we're very happy about that. And in terms of your question on double-digit operating margins, we've said for a long time and nothing's changed in that regard. We think that certainly double-digit operating margins are possible. If it means that we have some high single-digit operating margin that maximizes free cash flow, we're certainly okay with that and have room to go there. But we're certainly focused on how do we get the best free cash flow, free cash flow per share while getting great efficiency on our invested capital. And so nothing's changed there.\nOperator: We will take our last question from Sandy Aggarwal with Caris & Company.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Tom, in our assessment, there are many international markets which have grown healthier than the growth you achieved in Q4? And I know it is a blended growth number and probably some FX dynamics. But are you seeing any basically local e-commerce players getting stronger in international market? And secondly, any early signs of traction for the launch of the site in Italy?\nThomas Szkutak: Again, we grew 29% on a local-currency basis for international, 26% on a dollar basis, a challenging compare from fourth quarter of 2009 where we certainly, from a media perspective, had one of our best growth rates that we've had in any quarter previously. EGM grew at 50% on a local-currency basis, so very strong growth. And again, we have a long-standing practice. We're not talking about other companies, but we're very pleased with what our international team is doing. We have a great opportunity there for further growth. In terms of Italy, very early, but pleased with what we're seeing so far, and I like the opportunity there.\nOperator: This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Eldridge, I will turn the conference back over to you.\nRobert Eldridge: Thanks. Well, thanks everybody for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least until the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-10-22 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Amazon Quarterly Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Eldridge, please go ahead, Sir.\nRobert Eldridge: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Thomas Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect the management's views as of today, October 21, 2010 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Szkutak: Thanks Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 16% to $2.62 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 5% to $1.83 billion. Return on invested capital was 28%, down from 50%. ROIC is TTM-free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 451 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 39% to $7.56 billion or 40%, excluding the $83 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchanges rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime. Media revenue increased to $3.35 billion, up 14% or 15% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $3.97 billion, up 68% or 71% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 53% of worldwide sales, up from 43%. Worldwide unit growth was 41%. Active customer accounts were approximately 121 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 34% of total units. Consolidated gross profit grew 39% to $1.77 billion, and gross margin was 23.5%. Now, I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content in G&A combined was $1.37 billion or 18.2% of sales, up 120 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $657 million or 8.7% of revenue, compared with 8.2%. Tech and content was $386 million or 5.1% of revenue, compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $234 million or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.6% in the prior year. Now, I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $4.13 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $1.59 billion. EGM revenue grew 80% to $2.33 billion representing 56% of North America revenues, up from 45%. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $186 million, up 4.5% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 32% to $3.43 billion. Revenue growth was 35%, adjusting for the $86 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 16% to $1.76 billion or 18% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 54% to $1.64 billion or 60% excluding FX. EGM now represents 48% of international revenues, up from 41%. International segment operating income increased to 11% to $215 million, a 6.2% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact for foreign exchange, international segment operating income increased 20%. CSOI grew 15% to $401 million or 5.3% of revenue down a 112 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI grew 19%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 7% to $268 million or 3.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $79 million in Q3 or a 27% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $231 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared with $199 million and $0.45 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.88 billion year-over-year to $5.88 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $2.52 billion and inventory turns were 11.8 down from 12.1 turns a year ago, as we extended selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 38%, $4.61 billion and accounts payable days increased to 73 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2010 capital expenditures were $315 million. The increase in capital expenditure reflects additional investments and support of continued business growth, including investment in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our Fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance of the order trends that we seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and net foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q4, we expect net sales of between $12 and $13.3 billion a growth between 26% and 48%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis point of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $360 and $560 million between 24% decline and 18% growth. This includes approximately $140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment-operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $500 million and $700 million or between 16% decline and 17% growth. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.\nRobert Eldridge: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you remind our listeners how to initiate a question, please?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.\nScott Devitt: One question please, the growth rates for the business on our segment sales basis described between North America and in international is about 10 percentage points and it\u2019s begun to work in favor of North America recently. I was just wondering if you could comment on the respective unit sales domestically versus internationally, and it\u2019s described as similar? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Yeah, I can\u2019t \u2013 we are not breaking out the unit growth by segment, but we are seeing, very strong unit growth globally, it\u2019s up 41% which is certainly better than we\u2019ve seen recently. Also keep in mind when you look at the difference between North America revenue growth and international, we do have the impact of Zappos included in the North American numbers this year, which we wouldn\u2019t have that in last year as well.\nScott Devitt: Thanks.\nOperator: And for our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi, please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the Q4 guidance, particularly on the CSOI line. Typically, you are able to generate in flattish margins sequentially that\u2019s not which you are guiding to at the midpoint, is that because some of the investments you wanted to rollout in the September quarter are being delayed? Are there new levels of investments that you are looking for in the December quarter? Are you rolling out more distribution centers there? Anymore color on why the sequential decline in margins is a little bit out of the norm? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Thanks Mark. Yes, we have launched or opened about 10 performance centers right now. We have a couple more that are coming over the coming few weeks to get ready for our peak season. So certainly that\u2019s part of which we are seeing in Q4, obviously we have been incurring some cost on those three as well prior to Q4, but again you will see that ramping up. The other thing too is we will continue to add capacity for infrastructure as well during Q4 and that\u2019s both for our retail business as well as our very fast growing AWS business, so those are impacting the guidance which you see there.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks Tom.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.\nJames Mitchell: Great, thank you for taking the question. You are offering a range of free pass by to Amazon Prime such as Amazon Prime for students and Amazon Prime for mothers, how do you persuade the consumers to receive Prime for free-to-value and make full use of the service by purchasing more products as those consumers who are paying for Prime typically do?\nThomas Szkutak: Well, again it\u2019s a free offer, so that\u2019s something that we think is compelling and it follows really what we\u2019ve done for Prime in general. We\u2019ve offered free trials for Prime members going back to few years now, and the reason why we are doing that, again the free trials I\u2019m talking about, not just in the Mom right now. The reason why we were doing that was we wanted to make sure that customers could see the experience real time and we find that when customers see it real time, they become members and we\u2019ve seen that consistently and so the other two programs that you mentioned, the Student and Mom, still very early and we are happy with what we see but we are still very early.\nJames Mitchell: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Pitz with UBS.\nBrian Pitz: Thanks. What percent of the increase in fulfillment was due to the shift of third-party fulfillment from COGS that you highlighted the last quarter? And then more a longer term question, can you talk about your strategy in online video distribution, does it make sense for be it a rollout of subscription streaming video product given competitors\u2019 success? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: We are not breaking out the change that you mentioned, but you can \u2013 the way you should think about it is would be a similar amount last year in Q3, as it was in Q2 in terms of basis points. In terms of the second, can you repeat the second part of your question on..?\nBrian Pitz: Just in terms of your online video distribution, obviously you have VOD with over 65,000 titles, but migrating to a subscription streaming product, can you just give us a little thought on that given the success of some of your competitors?\nThomas Szkutak: Sure, I wouldn\u2019t speculate what we would do or not do in the future there, but now it\u2019s certainly and there room for a lot of innovation and we\u2019ve got a great team in place that\u2019s working on that and we are going to try to do what\u2019s best for customers over the long term and try to continually improve our service there.\nBrian Pitz: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with Barclays Capital, please go ahead.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Thomas, I wanted to ask you about the media business and hoping you could give us a little bit more color in terms of the sub-segments, in particular I think you commented last quarter that physical books were still growing in a double-digit phase, if you could let us know if that\u2019s still the case? And then just one quick housekeeping thing, the equity income line basically was a lot higher than what we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters, can you provide a little bit of color there and how we should think about that going forward? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. First, the media, in terms of \u2013 I\u2019ll take the North America, maybe we\u2019re seeing very good growth there, we\u2019re very pleased with the business that we have there. As it relates to books, we saw very strong revenue growth in the quarter, in fact from the unit perspective we saw accelerated growth in both physical and Kindle books in Q3 relative to Q2, so very strong growth during the quarter. We did see in a couple of our categories some softness, particularly music and video as we overlap some higher revenue in last year Q3 specifically. In the music side, we had very strong growth last year with some of the Michael Jackson titles. We also had very strong growth with the Beatles Box and video games, specifically video game consoles. There was very strong price reductions from the manufactures and which caused great growth last year and so we saw some softness that\u2019s in the North America media never succeed, but again we are very pleased with overall categories in media. In terms of the equity income and in terms of how you should think about it, we did have included in our guidance and I will give you the total numbers, but excluded from the guidance that we gave approximately 90 days ago, we did not include Woot acquisition and the impact from the quarter is roughly 30 million in revenue. From a CSOI perspective, we had a few million dollar loss for the quarter. And then because we had an investment in Woot, we had to step up that investment and fair value, so you have a gain that\u2019s included in the other income line, the equity income line that you\u2019re referring to, which brings our net down to about 15 million net or a little under $0.03 per share, so that\u2019s included in the numbers that you\u2019re looking at.\nDouglas Anmuth: Okay, great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray, please go ahead.\nGene Munster: Hey, good afternoon. If you can talk a little bit about your efforts in China, particularly you\u2019ve rebranded Joyo as Amazon Joyo this spring and I think they are best picking up some traction. Is there any data points you can share with us in terms of number of distribution centers, just general outlook, at what point do you think China particularly can start moving the wheels for Amazon? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Well, China is a very interesting long-term potential and we have businesses growing very fast there. We continue to add capacity there, we continue to work on trying to make sure we have a great experience of customers and so we\u2019re adding a lot of selection, we\u2019re making sure we have great prices. A lot of the things, same things that we\u2019re doing in all of our geography. So we\u2019ll continue to work hard on behalf of customers there and we think it\u2019s a very interesting long-term potential geography force.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Lazard Capital Markets.\nGreg O'Shara: Yes, hi. Greg O'Shara for Colin Sebastian. I was hoping maybe you could help provide some more color on the widening disparity between the electronics, the EGM sectors for North America and international. I know Zappos and Woot are not included, but surely the widening disparity in growth rates can\u2019t be attributable to that entirely. Are there any fundamental differences that you\u2019re seeing from a trend perspective in that sector internationally versus the US?\nThomas Szkutak: Well, again, you did call out couple items that are rather sizable, particularly the Zappos piece is rather sizable, so that certainly is impacting the size and the growth, because we remember that Zappos isn\u2019t included in the last year\u2019s Q3 result. But we\u2019re actually very, very pleased with EGM in both segments, they are both growing very fast and as you can see that even in Q3 for international grew 60% on local currency basis, so it\u2019s a very, very strong growth. We\u2019ve added a lot of new categories over the past two years there and they have grown quite nicely. So we\u2019re actually very pleased with our international growth in EGM and very excited about the future there.\nGreg O'Shara -- Lazard Capital Markets: Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Youssef Squali with Jefferies, please go ahead.\nYoussef Squali: Hi, thank you very much. Tom, you guys launched grocery delivery in the U.K., but it doesn\u2019t seem like you guys are doing your own delivery like some of the local competitors, can you speak the strategy there and any plans to launch a similar service in the U.S. I know you are testing it in a couple of places, but maybe talk about more nationwide rollout? And then just a housekeeping item, how much revenue is baked in your Q4 guidance from the BuyVIP acquisition that you did this quarter? Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: Okay, I\u2019ll speak to the second one first; BuyVIP hasn\u2019t closed and so it\u2019s not reflected in the guidance that we have given today. In terms of the first question, we think that grocery is very interesting. It\u2019s something that we are \u2013 there\u2019s not a lot I can comment about your question, specifically related to the U.K. It\u2019s something that we find it interesting, it\u2019s very early. Think of it, you mentioned about a national rollout for the U.S., think of it as a test for the U.S. We are testing it currently and have been testing it for a few years in Seattle, and we think that it\u2019s interesting, but again it\u2019s for test and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\nYoussef Squali: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities, please go ahead.\nJeetil Patel: Great, couple of questions. I guess, on the Prime side of the business, do you think you you've built great -- you've built great brand affinity with the Prime service as a whole. Do you think there are opportunities to bundle or offer additional free products, programs and services within that Prime program? Will the consumer adopt it, and is there maybe different tierings that you can create off of that, in terms of $79 and $89 or $99 with additional products and services folder then? Then second, around the Kindle side of the business, are there opportunities to leverage Whispersync across other forms of content, such as music and gaming or is there any sort of technical limitations around that? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the opportunity for Prime, we like what we see in Prime, the way that we would try to expand the benefit to customers to-date has been to try to make sure that we have more selection available for Prime customers. We do that in a number of different ways, one is we add retail offerings, additional retail selection. We\u2019ve also been working very hard with our seller community filled by Amazon and when you list with fulfilled by Amazon and have availability and stock those products available for our free shipping programs, which is Super Saver Shipping in the US as well as Prime. So those are the things that we have been doing to try to make Prime better. We will continue to look at ways to make Prime even better for customers over time and we will have to wait and see on that. In terms of the second part of your question, I apologize not a lot I can add to answer that question. I apologize in terms of this technology and its use outside of Kindle.\nOperator: Just a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. We\u2019ll go to our next questioner Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company, please go ahead.\nJim Friedland: Thanks. I have a question about the target deal that\u2019s coming to an end, I believe, its middle of next year. How should we think about modeling that business for next year? Any color you can give us into how it may impact the P&L, I think it\u2019s in the other line in the US? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Yeah, it is, we as you can probably appreciate Jim, we haven\u2019t disclosed anything about any specific, our partnership that we have and this will be no exception. I guess one way to think about it though is with something like this, we continue to grow like we are growing, we will likely need more capacity going forward and so we will be able to use capacity for, in this type of an event.\nJim Friedland: Okay, that\u2019s great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is Imran Khan with JP Morgan, please go ahead.\nImran Khan: Yes, hi it\u2019s Imran. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Two quick questions; one, international gross margins were down 80 basis point year-over-year. Just trying to get a sense like where you stand in terms of ramping up the third party business or some of the new category launch, can you give us some sense what\u2019s driving this international gross margins down and how should we think about it? And then secondly, the marketing costs were up 63% year-over-year basis. I start to think is it a new normal or is that like more of a one-time kindle marketing going on? If you can shed any light that would be very helpful? Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. In terms of international gross margins, there is a number of dynamics there, certainly pricing is impacting it. We are getting very good traction in third party, continue to get good traction in third party within international. Also keep in mind that we\u2019re talking about one of the earlier questions within EGM we\u2019ve launched many new categories over the past few years that are growing, those categories growing very well as I mentioned the growth is up 60% year-over-year on local currency basis in total and what ends up happening when you launch new categories is many of those are low gross margins at the start and then we worked very hard overtime to be more efficient to buy better and so those categories improve over time. So again those are the things that are impacting gross margins. In terms of marketing, a couple of things to think about; one, you are right we are a little over 3%, very similar to what we were in increase year-over-year last quarter, the primary area that we spend in marketing is web page search and associates still. Keep in mind that when you look at year-over-year, last year we didn\u2019t have Zappos and we continue to support the marketing efforts for Zappos which is included in that cost. As you mentioned also, we are also doing some ads from a television standpoint for Kindle included in those numbers as well.\nImran Khan: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal with Caris & Company, please go ahead.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Alright, Tom, in your prepared remarks you did update us on the spending on procurement center et cetera. I guess the question is that you are spending on fulfillment and centers and as well as IT capacity. If Q4 will take care of most of the higher than norm spending or will you go beyond that? And secondly now that you have three years of history on selling Kindle, in long run will you think the 999 price plan will prevail or a $15? Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the capacity, again we are adding additional capacity in Q4, both from our fulfillment center and infrastructure standpoint, and beyond Q4 we are not commenting but certainly if we continue to grow you should expect like we are growing expect that we will add capacity next year. In terms of Kindle, we are trying to make selection available from a content perspective at great prices for customers and that\u2019s no different than any other product that we offer to customers, we think it should be very economic to customers and we will continue to work very hard on behalf of customers in that area.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse, please go ahead.\nSpencer Wang: Thanks, good afternoon. First question, I guess, Tom, can you just go back to your earlier comment about video on demand and I think you used a phrase \u201croom for innovation,\u201d any more kind of color you could shed there in terms of how you are thinking about it, is it innovation in terms of pricing or selection or revenue model or UI? And then secondly just real quick any stats or data point you could give us in terms of sizing mobile commerce for you. Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of video in demand, there is not a lot more I can add to that. I would say that I guess that where I would think about it is not a lot different than a lot of the things that we do on Amazon, we have a foundation of innovation everything that we do and we try to find creative ways and innovative ways to serve customers better and so that\u2019s grained very well in the culture, you have seen that in a lot of different ways in our various offerings and we will continue to do that as best we can on behalf of the customers over long term which includes Video On Demand. And then second part of our question, sorry was\u2026\nSpencer Wang: So any data point on mobile, sizing mobile for you guys commerce?\nThomas Szkutak: No, again I think I don\u2019t have any new data to share with you there. It is an interesting area for us, and if you think about just a growth in connected devices anytime, you can have a very fast growth in adoption of connected devices in around the world where customers can get easy access to amzon.com, we think it\u2019s a good thing to tail in for us and so what we are trying to do is try to make that as easy for customers with APIs and another ways so that we can serve customers well, so they get a great experience when they connect with their device. So that\u2019s something that certainly we are working and we find it interesting.\nSpencer Wang: Thanks.\nOperator: And for our final question from Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Thank you. First on the Kindle, a lot of language in your press release about it, can you help us at all understand if it\u2019s margin accretive on the gross margin line when you think about the hardware and software or not and then secondly you are making a lot of infrastructure investments, a lot of headcount investments in the course of Fulfillment, can you give us any visibility if you think you\u2019re kind of caught up now this year given the spending last year or this is something that no idea of kind of wind, when you are kind of going to be caught up with what you need to be? Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. The first part as you can probably appreciate, we don\u2019t break out any of our products or categories from a possibility standpoint and so we have a [Inaudible] doing that and so the details that we provided, to-data is just the North American International segment from a possibility standpoint. So, I can\u2019t help you much there. In terms of infrastructure and capacity, just sort of - excuse me in terms of film capacity, you\u2019re right we added a lot of capacity to date, we have some more that we are adding in Q4 and that\u2019s the serve on demand that we think is in front of us and we will have to see, wait and see what happens over the coming quarters to see what capacity we need to have. But what I can say is from our regional perspective; you can see our overall growth rates are very strong. And if they continue to be strong, we will have to add additional capacity. We are seeing very good traction fulfilled by Amazon which is also why we are also adding capacity for and we like that part of the business from a seller perspective a lot. From an infrastructure standpoint, again just with the growth that we are seeing from a retail perspective, we are adding capacity to support the retail websites that we have around the world. In addition to that, we have a very fast growing web services business that has great traction, continues to grow well and certainly should expect that we will add capacity there over time to serves that growth.\nJustin Post: Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today on the call and for your questions. The replay will be available on our industrial relations website at least to the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest and look forward to talking with you again in next quarter. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. "}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-07-23 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Amazon Quarterly Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rob Eldridge, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRobert Eldridge: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 22, 2010 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Szkutak: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 29% to $1.99 billion. Return on invested capital is 34%, down from 42%. ROIC is TTM-free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 451 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $6.57 billion, or 42%, excluding the $48 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection with free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime. Media revenue increased to $2.87 billion, up 18%. EGM revenue increased to $3.49 billion, up 69%, or 70% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 53% of worldwide sales, up from 45%. Worldwide unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 118 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million, up 19%. Seller units were 32% of total units. Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.61 billion, and gross margin was 24.5%. Beginning this quarter, we no longer allocate Fulfillment costs related to the third-party inventory to cost of sales. Using our prior method, gross margin in Q2 2010 was 24.1%. Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content in G&A combined was $1.2 billion, or 18.3% of sales, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $558 million, or 8.5% of revenue, compared with 8.4%. Using the prior method of allocating Fulfillment costs related to third-party inventory to cost of sales, Q2 2010 Fulfillment was 8.1% of revenue. Tech and content was $350 million or 5.3% of revenue, compared with 5.5%. Marketing was $204 million, or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.7% in the prior year. Now I'll talk about our segment results and, consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 46% to $3.59 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $1.32 billion. The sequential decline in quarter-over-quarter growth rates was driven primarily by seasonality in textbook sales and slower rates of growth in video games and video game consoles. EGM revenue grew 76% to $2.09 billion, representing 58% of North America revenues, up from 48%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $200 million; a 5.6% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 35% to $2.98 billion. Revenue growth was 38%, adjusting for the $54 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 20% to $1.55 billion, or 21% excluding foreign exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 59% to $1.4 billion, or 63% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 47% of International revenues, up from 40%. International segment operating income increased 15% to $206 million; a 6.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 21%. CSOI grew 34% to $406 million, or 6.2% of revenue; down 35 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $10 million unfavorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 37%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 71% to $270 million, or 4.1% of net sales. Q2 2009 operating income was negatively impacted by a $51 million legal settlement. Our income tax expense was $88 million in Q2, or a 30% rate for the quarter. During the quarter, we recorded estimated tax expense associated with tentative agreements between the Japanese and the U.S. tax authorities on the allocation of income between the U.S. and Japan for 2003 through 2005, resulting in a three percentage point increase in our effective tax rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $207 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with $142 million and $0.32 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.9 billion year-over-year to $5.11 billion. Inventory increased 46% to $1.94 billion and inventory turns were 12.5, up from 12.4 turns a year ago, even as we extended selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 41% to $3.55 billion, and accounts payable days were 65, unchanged from the prior-year. Our Q2 2010 capital expenditures were $196 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments and support of continued business growth, including capacity to support our Fulfillment operations, additional investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and net foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q3, we expect net sales of between $6.9 billion and $7.625 billion, a growth between 27% and 40%. This guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $210 million and $310 million, or between a 16% decline and 24% growth. This anticipates approximately $130 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $340 million and $440 million, or be between 3% decline and 26% growth. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting the customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.\nRobert Eldridge: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank. [ :p id=\"27825561\" name=\"Jeetil Patel\" /> First of all, I guess as it relates to, broadly, Fulfillment. I guess can you talk about -- maybe a little bit more color on Fulfillment capacity being layered into the business? I guess, is that both Domestic and International, or just more of a U.S. kind of phenomenon? Maybe a bit more color on, I guess, how much of this incremental capacity is being allocated to your partners, seller partners out there. And I guess is this the build-up in front of the holiday season that you typically do? And then second, are you seeing consumers still buy more books in an environment where consumers have the Kindle App available on multiple devices these days?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of answering your first question, just to clarify. On the performance expense as a percentage of revenue, we have historically reallocated some of our cost from operating expenses to COGS. And when we stopped reporting gross margins last quarter, we decided this quarter not to allocate some of our cost out of operating expenses and into COGS. And the impact of that is a little over 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue. So in other words, our operating expenses for Fulfillment are about 40 basis points, as a percentage of revenue, higher than they would have been if that we have not done this. And the offset is in COGS. So then if you take a look at it, those Fulfillment expenses, we are growing very, very fast. And so we're adding capacity to support growth. And we plan on adding 13 Fulfillment centers this year after keeping our Fulfillment center structure relatively flat. Last year, we did add some capacity, but we're certainly adding a lot more this year. And that's, again, to support that growth. That's both in terms of our retail customers as well as Fulfillment by Amazon, our partners. And your question around whether it's Domestic or International, it's across geographies. So it\u2019s 13 Fulfillment centers across geographies. And so we're very excited about it because, again, we're experiencing a look at our overall growth rates at 42% on a local currency basis. This quarter, 42%; last quarter, 37% in Q4. So again, we're growing very, very strong. So and then in terms of your second question, could you just elaborate a little bit further? I didn't...\nJeetil Patel: I think early on when the Kindle device came out, you had just actually talked about how consumers were purchasing more books through the Kindle device. Are you seeing, now that you have a Kindle App that resides in multiple different devices, products out there in the marketplace, are you seeing consumers buy more books via the Kindle App?\nThomas Szkutak: What we're seeing is strong growth on Kindle as well as the Apps. So we're seeing very, very strong growth on Kindle. So it's really across the board, is what you\u2019re saying.\nJeetil Patel: Is this idea of the cloud-based computing for books really resonating with consumers today? Is the idea of this cloud-based kind of format of reading or having availability of digital books resonating with consumers, such that I can read my book on a PC, my BlackBerry and my iPhone and Kindle, and switch around depending on what's convenient for me? Is that\u2026\nThomas Szkutak: It certainly is. And customers can come and buy content on the Kindle, and buy it once and use it everywhere, which is great. And so we're seeing -- as you probably saw in the release from earlier in the week, we\u2019re seeing very, very strong device growth and we're seeing very, very strong content growth. And we're extremely pleased with what we're seeing there.\nOperator: And our next question is from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.\nScott Devitt: Tom, if you go back over the past four quarters, on average, you had been beating the midpoint of your revenue guidance by approximately 7% in op inc [operating income] by about 27%. And in the second quarter, revenue was towards the high-end of guidance, but the operating income was at the midpoint. So could you maybe talk about anything in the business that you felt that changed in the quarter? Or how we should think about your forward-operating guidance, going forward relative to now the past five quarters?\nThomas Szkutak: When we set out guidance, we\u2019re trying to be very helpful. We\u2019re trying to be giving you our best forecast of what's going to happen during the quarter. We have had some times where we've been on the high-end of that and been over it, but certainly when we provide guidance, that's not what we're trying to do. We're trying to give an accurate description of what we think the range will be. And so we approach it the same way every time and we give the guidance that we think is appropriate. And as you mentioned, our results today are well within -- it's in the top half for revenue guidance. It's also in the top half for Consolidated segment operating income as well.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from James Mitchell from Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: Could you talk about why the International operating margins are trending down, while the Domestic operating margins are trending up? Does that primarily reflect makeshift in terms of third-party and EGM within each market, or more for the 13 new Fulfillment centers outside North America than inside it? And to what extent are the 13 new Fulfillment centers already hitting expenses in the second quarter versus coming in in the third quarter?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of International. First of all, I want to highlight a couple things related to International. International saw an accelerated growth this quarter. It was 38% growth on a local currency basis. That's the strongest growth rate in any quarter that we've had in International in over five years. So we saw very good growth. And there\u2019s a number of things that's driving it. We've added a lot of selection over the past few years. If you look back and you see just the categories that we've launched over the past few years, we continue to add selection in existing categories, but in those new categories that we've launched over the past few years. And so that growth from new and existing categories is certainly doing quite well. We're making sure that we're very competitive from a pricing standpoint, which is helping. And certainly, other things such as Prime is having a noticeable impact on the growth rate there. So that's really what's driving the growth rate. And with that accelerated growth rate in some of those newer categories, we're seeing some mix. Again, we have a number of categories that are very new there over the past few years, and they're coming up the scale. But it's still very early. So you should assume that many of those are lower gross margin categories and you can see that reflected in the EGM growth within International. So again, saw very, very strong growth there. In terms of Fulfillment centers, I mentioned this to, I think, it was to Jeetil\u2019s question earlier. We haven't -- the plan is to add 13. You're seeing some of the cost starting in Q2 for some of those Fulfillment centers and you see more, as reflected in our guidance for Q3. But again, they\u2019re dispersed in a number of different geographies.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.\nMark Mahaney: The tax rate. There are one-time items in that sound like, the way you\u2019ve described it, [indiscernible] going forward? Secondly, do you think it would be apples-to-apples North America and International gross margin under the old accounting methodologies? And then third, you talked about marketing expenses? [indiscernible] to pick up. Is there some change in your strategy or did you find marketing expense in this quarter?\nThomas Szkutak: We did mention on a tax rate standpoint, our tax rate was 30%. Yes, if there\u2019s any one-time unusuals, I think is what you asked for, there was one that I mentioned in my opening remarks related to Japan. And we have a tentative agreement there, and the impact of that is about 300 basis points on that tax rate. So without that, it would've been approximately 27% for the quarter. In terms of marketing, you asked a question around marketing. Our approach has been consistent. The spend that you're seeing during the quarter is primarily online. If you're looking at the year-over-year growth that you're seeing in terms of basis points, certainly, we have Zappos and our quarterly numbers, which we didn't have last year. And if you -- many of you probably saw the results prior to consolidating and they were spending at a percentage of revenue, a much greater rate than Amazon was. And you should assume that they're still spending at a rate that's faster than Amazon and that's reflected in that total. You also may have noticed that we're doing some broad-skill advertising, TV advertising for Kindle, which we think is the right thing to do, and included in the number that you see there.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Looks like you added 2,200 people in the quarter. Could you explain where those people are mostly centered toward? Are they on digital initiatives, maybe helping improve the Kindle or are they more Fulfillment center-related? And secondly, any timeframe from when kind of the personnel ramp-up could kind of slow down? Is that next year or is it sooner than that?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the growth, sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, we did add 2,200 people. The majority of those were operations people. And within that operation, the majority of those were to support new volume; I should say, the volume that we're seeing. And so that's within there. The rest of the growth rate, supporting the things that we've been talking about over the past several years. We're supporting new category growth both in North America and International. We're supporting the growth in Kindle, supporting our Seller business, supporting our fast-growing Web Services business. Those are the things that we're supporting to grow our business going forward.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from James Friedland with Cowen and Company.\nJames Friedland: Looking at free cash flow, it seems like it's unusually low for Q2. And I know it moves around, but it looks like part of the reason is ramping up on inventory a little earlier in the year. Can you provide some color around that?\nThomas Szkutak: Well, our inventory, actually, our turns improved slightly year-over-year, about a 10th of a turn. So we're pleased with what we see there. You're right, you do have some volatility in free cash flow. Certainly, one of the things that you're seeing is CapEx was $196 million in the quarter, which is up and that's really in a few different pieces, but certainly, the incremental spend relates to capacity that's both on the Fulfillment side as well as infrastructure side and the infrastructure side to support our Retail business as well as fast-growing AWS business.\nJames Friedland: And on that CapEx, should we look at that roughly $200 million you're spending per quarter? I know there's $100 million of incremental expense in for the year for the new facility move. But is that sort of a baseline excluding that facility impact?\nThomas Szkutak: Q3 should be our highest quarter of the year so far, and you should expect that number to be more than $300 million during Q3. And again, we plan to add 13 Fulfillment centers this year. We plan to add infrastructure capacity to support our faster-growing business, which includes AWS. And on the Fulfillment side, it's not just to support our retail business but to support our FBA business, supporting our Cellar partners so in addition to the office space comments that you made.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We go to Brian Pitz with UBS.\nBrian Pitz: Should we expect an even larger ramp-up as a percent of revenue in Q4, given more aggressive spending on Kindle? And can you talk about what's driving acceleration in other revenue? Is it Amazon products ads or Web Services?\nThomas Szkutak: I heard the first question, but could you repeat the second part?\nBrian Pitz: Could you discuss the acceleration in other revenues? Is it some of your initiatives in Amazon product ads or maybe Web Services?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of other revenue, there's a number of things that are in there, but certainly, our Web Services business is included in other revenue and it's growing very fast. So we're certainly seeing that. In terms of marketing, we're not giving guidance on any specific line item in Q3 in our guidance, and we're not giving any guidance at this point for Q4. But I would expect that we're going to approach marketing very similar to what you've seen over the past quarter. The vast majority of it will be online. We would still expect our Zappos team to continue to market as they have, and as you've seen so far this quarter, we've been doing some TV ads for Kindle during the quarter as well. So all of that would be included in our marketing and reflected in our guidance.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth from Barclays Capital.\nDouglas Anmuth: Tom, I was hoping you could comment on the North America media business, and in particular, it grew 15% on certainly an easier comp from last year. You pointed to a couple things there. But any more detail that you can provide here and how much, I guess in particular, is this related to the digital success that you're having through the Kindle?\nThomas Szkutak: The growth rate, the deceleration that you see is driven primarily by seasonality in textbook and also weakness in video games and video games consoles. From a textbook standpoint, it's very seasonal. It was growing very fast in Q1. It's not as much of an impact in Q2 as you would imagine and then, the weakness in video games and video game consoles due to allocations on the console side and also a lack of major releases. But in terms of growth from the book side, if you've seen the release earlier in the weak, we're seeing a very, very strong growth in both Kindle device, which is in EGM, as well as Kindle content, which is in media. So it's growing very, very fast. But our fiscal book business, while the Kindle books are growing dramatically, is also growing double digits year-over-year in the quarter. So we're very pleased with our overall book business, both our physical and digital business.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Spencer Wang with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: Tom, can you give us a sense of roughly the impact from the Zappos acquisition in the quarter? And also, was there any impact from the change in the Kindle hardware accounting?\nThomas Szkutak: Yes, in terms of those two pieces, we're not breaking those out. I think a way to think about it, though, is if you look at our EGM growth rate from North America, which is where those two things would occur, if you back those up, we still saw an accelerated growth rate. So again, we're not providing individual product line details in this case, but that's what we're seeing.\nSpencer Wang: And on the accounting change, Tom?\nThomas Szkutak: Was including both of those in that number when I said that.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Shawn Milne with Janney Capital Markets.\nShawn Milne: Just first on a housekeeping front, can you give us a sense for what kind of capacity, the percent of capacity that you would be adding with a 13 distribution centers? Any sense of magnitude there would be helpful. And secondly, if you can give us any color on just the pace of business through the second quarter, June relative to April.\nThomas Szkutak: Yes, in terms of the number of Fulfillment centers, 13 is on a base of just under 40 to size it a little bit. And in terms of pace, we don't give updates on inter-quarter. But again, as you can see from our overall growth rate, we saw very, very strong growth in Q2, up 42% on a local currency basis, 46% from North America, 38% for international. International was the best growth rate of any quarter we've had in a little over five years. So it's very strong. There was World Cup going on about 20 days, the last 20 days of the quarter. And hard to say what kind of impact that had, but I'm sure it had some impact but that was included in that 38% growth on a local currency basis. But again, we're not a bellwether for the economy, and we focus very hard on expanding selection and making sure we have great prices and making sure that we have great convenience for customers, including Amazon Prime. So those are the things that we're focused on, and it was really what's driving the growth that we see today.\nShawn Milne: Just a quick follow-up on the 13 distribution centers out of the 40 plus, I'm assuming that these are more regional in nature and that, blended, the average of the square footage would be a little bit lower than what we've seen from some of the sort of early distribution centers. Is that a fair take?\nThomas Szkutak: It was 13 on just under 40 and not just over 40, and we're not providing the square footage details. But I would think of them as varying size and in different regions.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Imran Khan from JPMorgan.\nImran Khan: It seems like CapEx grew fifth straight quarter and look like at 15% of your revenue and depreciation and amortization grew like 53%. So how should we think about the CapEx? What's driving this CapEx growth? So that's question number one. And question number two, it seems like high end, you're guiding 40% revenue growth but operating income growth rate of 24%. So what's driving the deleverage? And the third, how many Kindle Apps for iPad has been downloaded? Can you give us some sense on that?\nThomas Szkutak: Sure, I'll take your CapEx question first. The largest pieces of the increase are related to capacity, and it's capacity both from a Fulfillment perspective and an infrastructure perspective. When I say Fulfillment, it's to support our fast-growing Retail business as well as our fast-growing Fulfillment by Amazon business, where we fulfill on behalf of our partners. From a infrastructure standpoint, we're supporting, again, our Retail business but also we have a AWS business that's growing very, very strong right now, and so we're supporting that growth by adding CapEx. So that's what's included in the CapEx. In terms of the range of guidance, I just wanted to clarify a little bit. You said the upper end of the range was 40%. Keep in mind that, that anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable exchange rates, so at the high end of the range, it's more like 43% as well as on the bottom end of the range for CSOI, you mentioned 24%, it's actually 26%, and that anticipates approximately 600 basis points of exchange. So at the high end of the range, it would be 43% growth x exchange for revenue, 32% growth x -- excuse me, on the high end of the range, 43% excluding exchange for revenue and 32% growth excluding exchange on CSOI. And again, it reflects our best estimate for the high end of that range and the things that we see. But again, it anticipates some of the things that I'm talking about. It anticipates the capacity that will show up in CapEx as well as operating expense across a number of different fronts. And then the rest of the operating expenses in support of the things that we've been talking about, again, for the last several year, it's the growing retail business, both in North America and international, our Seller business, AWS, our Kindle business, Seller business, if I didn't say that. So again, those are the things that we're adding resources to, to support the opportunities that we see going forward.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Colin Sebastian with Lazard.\nColin Sebastian: One clarification on the media segment given the questions there, was the performance in that segment under your expectations for the quarter? And then secondly, I'm curious about your view of the consumer environment versus 90 days ago and if you're preparing for this holiday period any differently than maybe you were last year at this time.\nThomas Szkutak: We're very, very pleased with the media growth, and so we're very pleased with what we saw. We're extremely pleased with our Kindle content growth. And again, as I mentioned, our physical books also grew double digits year-over-year during the quarter. So we're very, very pleased with overall books business as related to that. And again, we saw our sequential decline based on, primarily, the textbook sales seasonality and also some weakness in video games and video game consoles, again, due to allocations and lack of major releases. Even though we saw weakness in our video games and video game console business, we're still very pleased with that business, and we think we're doing -- the team's doing a great job in terms of the fundamental supporting customers, and we like the opportunities that we see there.  In terms of the consumer sentiment, again, I don't think we're the bellwether. What we're seeing is reflected in our Q2 results, which were from a growth standpoint, very, very strong.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Sandeep Aggarwal with Caris and company.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Tom, can you talk about maybe the average selling price for the Kindle e-books and even if we don't want to talk about the exact pricing, maybe directionally how they have trended last two quarters? And secondly, the price reduction in Kindle device in June, is it fair to assume that it was gross margin mostly?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the ASP in Kindle, I can't help you with the average. But what I can help you with is if you take a look at some of the details that we provided earlier in the week, and I'll point you to that release where we have over 630,000 titles, 510,000 of those were $9.99 or below. That excludes the $1.8 million pre-1923 free content that we have in the Kindle. So there's just great values and great selection for customers. And we're seeing that customers responding to that great selection and the convenience of the device, the convenience of the apps. The fact that you can buy at once on Kindle and read it in many different places is really important to customers. And again, there's just great values there as well.\nSandeep Aggarwal: And Tom, just in terms of growth, the price reduction in the Kindle device?  Is it...\nThomas Szkutak: I've not commented on the individual margins of any product line, but what I would say is not unlike any product that we sell, we're trying to make sure that we can get the best values to customers, and we're committed to doing that. And we think we're very fortunate to see -- when we dropped our price from $259 down to $189, we started tripling of growth rate, which we're extremely pleased to see. And we're very happy with our Kindle business and it has great momentum right now.\nOperator: And we'll take our last question from Heath Terry with FBR Capital Markets.\nHeath Terry: Can you give us a sense of what kind of traction you're seeing for Kindle at Target since the rollout there? And then, looking at the category expansion in International, how much expansion do you have left given the verticals that you've added before the offering outside the U.S. starts to parallel what you're offering inside the U.S.?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of Target, we have a longstanding practice of not talking about any results from a specific partner. But we're pleased overall with our growth in Kindle all the way around, and we're pleased with our relationship there. In terms of International, we have -- we're still adding a lot of selections in International in each of the categories that we're in, older categories that we've been in for years as well as the newer categories that I mentioned earlier and still think there's the tremendous opportunity to add selection there. Keep in mind that we also have, within International, an opportunity to add new geographies and new categories and selection, obviously, in those geographies. So we think there's great opportunities there.\nRobert Eldridge: Thank you for joining the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-04-23 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2010 Financial Results Conference. (Operator Instructions) At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead sir.\nRob Eldridge: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 22, 2010, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks Rob, I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trolling 12 month free cash grew 62% to $2.32 billion. Return on invested capital is 45% up from 41%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock based towards outstanding 463 million shares compared with 447 million. World wide revenue grew 46% to $7.13 billion or 42% excluding the $185 million payable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and pre-shipping offers including Amazon Prime. Media revenue increased to $3.43 up 26% or 22% excluding foreign exchange rates. ETM revenue increased to $3.51 billion of 72% or 68% excluding FX. World wide EGM increased to 49% of world wide sales up from 42%. World wide unit growth was 40%; active customer accounts exceeded a 114 million. And for the first time this number includes our Amazon China customer accounts. World-wide active seller accounts were approximately $2 million of 22%. Sold units were 31% of total units. Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.63 billion and gross margin decreased 62 basis points up to 22.9%. We no longer present gross profit as our consolidated statement of operations as we believe income from operations is more meaningful measure due to the diversity of our product categories and services. Our focus is on growing operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock based compensation. Fulfillment in marketing tech and content and G&A combined was $1.12 billion or 15.8% of sales down 115 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $528 million or 7.4% of revenue compared with 8.3%. Tech and content was $319 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $196 million or 2.7% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year. Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock based compensation or other operating expense line items. In North America segment, revenue grew 47% to $3.78 billion. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.6 billion. EGM revenue grew 72% to $2.02 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues, up from 45%. North America segment operating income increased 81% to $273 million, or 7.2% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 45% to $3.35 billion. Revenue growth was 37%, adjusting for the $175 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 29% to $1.83 billion or 23% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 68% to $1.49 billion or 61% excluding FX. EGM now represents 44% of international revenues, up from 38%. International segment operating income increased 37% to $234 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates international segment operating income increased 26%. CSOI grew 58% to $507 million or 7.1% of revenue up 53 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 53%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 62% to $394 million or 5.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $100 million in Q1 or a 25% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $299 million of course, $0.66 per diluted share compared with $177 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.33 billion year-over-year to $5.06 billion. Inventory increased 44% to $1.82 billion and inventory turns were 12.6 up from 12.5 turns a year ago, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 52% to $3.62 billion and accounts payable days increased to 59 from 57 in the prior year. Our Q1 2010 capital expenditures were $140 million, the increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon web services, additional investments and support of continued business growth including capacity to support fulfillment operations and investments and corporate office-base which we expect to continue throughout 2010. I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance of the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as global economy and consumer spending. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict and end and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling inter company balances and foreign currency amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions or stock based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange remained approximately where they have been recently. For Q2 we expect net sales of between $6.1 and $6.7 billion or growth of between 31% and 44%. This anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income could be between $220 and $320 million or grow between 39% and 102%. The second quarter 2009 results include the impact of our settlement with Toys \u201cR\u201d Us for $51 million substantially all of which was expensed during the quarter. This includes approximately $130 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock based compensation and other operating expense to be between $350 and $450 million, a growth of between 15% and 48%. We remain head strong focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe the prudent customer first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks and with that Rob let's move to questions.\nRob Eldridge: Great, thanks Tom, let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And we will go first to Colin Sebastian with Lazard Capital Markets.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks, and congratulations on a very strong quarter. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the same day delivery program, how that's playing out in cities where it's offered and if there is something that could be rolled out more broadly amid successful testing in the existing markets? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Sure and probably the best way to describe it is similar to other programs that we have related to past shipping in prime. We are finding that customers like it, we certainly think that new customers like the reliability of getting their products so efficiently, so quickly and hard to say what we do beyond what we are doing today with same day but we certainly think that getting product to customers fast is important.\nOperator: We will go next to James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: I have two question, one is with regard to the very large active customer number that include China but with Zappos I assumed I would like may 5 million each from China and from Zappos if you did include Zappos. And then secondly even I look at the expansion in North America and operating margins in the quarter. With that helped by sales of digital media and also of Amazon web services thank you?\nTom Szkutak: I will take the second part first, you know the North America expansion was driven by you know a number of things certainly the very strong growth and then it was also driven by you know us being able to leverage raw expenses if you take a look at our global fulfillment type cost as a percentage of revenue you can certainly see a lot of leverage there and that\u2019s also true when you look at North America. We haven\u2019t added you know any significant capacity in North America since Q3 of 08. You know certainly with growth rates that you are seeing, you should expect that we will be adding capacity over time there. But again it was driven by a lot of different factors and you know with a lot of different product categories are growing very strong and thus being able to leverage those expenses. In terms of the first part can you repeat the first part again it was related to?\nJames Mitchell: On the customers does that include China and also Zappos or just China and is it fair to assume that each of China and Zappos which contribute about 5 million active customers?\nTom Szkutak: Yeah James you are correct the active customer does not include Zappos but it does include China this quarter for the first time. And we are not at this point breaking out the addition of China at this point. So it is 114 million active customers world wide at this point.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with Barclays Capital.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks, just two quick questions, can you comment on the head count when you went about 1800 people on a sequential basis certainly larger number then we would have expected. And then the second one is just the tax rate being a little bit higher at 25% and is that purely just a function of higher North America profit?\nTom Szkutak: The first part in terms of head count, the biggest piece of that is related to fulfillment. You know when we coming out of Q4 we always have a certain people additions related to that and so again a sizeable piece of that incremental headcount was due to operations in the rest was you know certainly in the areas to help us grow as we move forward. In terms of the effective tax rate certainly the mix of our geographies are certainly what\u2019s making that change.\nOperator: We will go next to Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Co.\nYoussef Squali: First one of your competitors talks about seeing some weakness in Europe. Ex-UK and looking at your international margins it looks like they came little bit under pressure. They were down by 40 or 50 bps year-on-year. Is that something you guys saw as well and then by our estimates are the change in accounting for Kindle that you instituted in Q1 resulted, again by our map in somewhere between $80 and $100 million of additional revenues for the quarter, can you maybe just help us understand if we are in the right zip code there?\nTom Szkutak: The first question, we are not bringing out individual geographies within the international segment but what you are seeing in the international is you know very strong growth and we were pleased across all of our geographies we saw excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates we saw growth of 37%, you know, which is certainly very good and it was driven by a number of things certainly we have added many new categories and a lot of selections over the past few years and we certainly have or focused on making sure that we have great and a competitive low prices and that would certainly fuel in growth prime is also a factor and third-party growth, continues to be very strong and so those are the factors that are driving the international growth. In terms of the change in accounting for Kindle, we are not breaking out any precise numbers on that but the way you should think about it is, may be a few (inaudible) one is if you look at our overall growth rate and you look at on a local currency basis and we certainly have for the first time of four quarter of Zappos included in those numbers as well as the change in accounting for Kindle and if you back off, exchange in those two items and compare it to the equivalent growth rate in Q4, you did see, a few hundred basis points, acceleration and growth from Q4 to Q1. So, it can be much more of a breakup than that but you can see that, we did an acceleration growth there.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Brian Pitz with UBS.\nBrian Pitz: It was your comment on the impetus to begin selling the Kindle through brick-and-motor stores, then do you expect to make the device more widely available? Also, I\u2019m just curious why the rollout is limited to so few stores, thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Well it\u2019s starting with a small number of stores but we are very pleased to be working with Target and we think we are very pleased to have even more customers see Kindle and have the opportunity to purchase Kindle. So that\u2019s why we are doing it and we are very excited to do it.\nBrian Pitz: Right.\nOperator: We will go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.\nMark Mahaney: I know why you may not want to talk so much about gross margins. I understand you're running the business for operating profits and then cash flow. But could you provide a little bit more color on the gross margin trends, particularly in international markets, given what should be some pretty positive mix shifts and scale factors, but mix shifts towards the digital goods and AWS and things like that. The trends seem a little surprising. Anything in terms of vendor terms, product mixes that may have explained the gross margin trends. Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of international it was primarily driven by a certainly number of factors we continue to have lower prices and make sure we have great competitive prices and a challenging environment which includes free shipping offers and it was on prime included in that and keep in mind that we\u2019ve launched many new categories over the past few years and so as we talked about in the past it takes sometime to get the scale in those categories and we are seeing very broad growth across many categories including the new categories and so that\u2019s certainly that mix is having an impact and that means all those factors have been partially offset by very strong solid third-party growth as well as the savings that we will get from our vendor partners so again those are the key drivers.\nMark Mahaney: And one quick follow up on marketing for the Kindle, is there any change in your thinking of the level of marketing support you want to provide given obviously a much more competitive environment?\nTom Szkutak: Well in terms of marketing itself you saw that it increased a little bit as a percentage of revenue year-over-year and we are doing advertising for Kindle, it's certainly a product and an area that we are very excited about. You probably seen some of the ads that we are doing as well as doing on my marketing.\nOperator: We will go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.\nScott Devitt: Great, thanks for taking the question. The first quarter operating margin was 7.1% and at the midpoint of revenue and operating margin on a cash basis in Q2 I think it's 6.3% so Tom could you just talk through what the factors are that would drive operating down sequentially that order of magnitude and then secondly, stock based compensation I think you guided to $110 million and did $87 million and then guided to $130 million in 2Q, so what's the volatility in that line item -- in the first quarter and going forward, thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Sure, I will take the second part first. The 87 is actually the equivalent of stock based compensation amortization intangibles which is one 113. And so it's come from 113 to 130. In terms of the operating margin, we are not giving operating margin guidance for Q2 but implied operating margin and we do have a consistent what we have done in prior periods. We have a range of operating income and that range is 350 to 450 at the low end of the range it's 5.7% of implied operating margin and 6.7 on the high end. On the high end you would see an expansion of operating margins of approximately 20 basis year-over-year and so that\u2019s the guidance based upon what we see if by looking at all the factors and there is not much I can help you with that. I would one thing to keep in mind those I mentioned in one of the earlier questions, with growth we are experiencing, we need to make sure we support that growth. And what that means is we will continue to add capacity at our various businesses to support that growth whether it be our retail business or AWS business or third-party seller business including FBA. And so those are things that we certainly are supporting giving the growth that we are having. The other thing is we will continue as we haven\u2019t in prior years. We still think there is a lot of opportunity in front of us and so as we haven\u2019t prior years. We\u2019ll make sure that we are judicious about where we make those additions. But we will add resources to make sure that we capitalize on those growth opportunities. So those are the things that we are thinking about.\nOperator: We will go next to Jeetil Patel, with Deutsche Bank Securities\nJeetil Patel: And thank you. Two questions. I guess the unit growth nicely accelerated from the fourth quarter levels, and the trend line you have been seeing historically, I guess can you talk about whether that is more of a function of the domestic business and still seeing very good purchase frequency or international now participating as Prime has now been out there for well north of two years? And then second just broader question, but in a world where we are going towards mobile and smartphones from an immediate consumption standpoint, can you, I guess, talk about what is the opportunity from an e-commerce standpoint? Do you think that it will be just as good of an e-commerce-oriented environment on a mobile device as you see in a desktop internet world since it\u2019s a smaller form factor, smaller screen? How do you have to change if you have to in terms of how you present information to consumers? 14th file\nTom Szkutak: Jeetil, I will take the second part of your question first. We are excited about the idea that the world may shift to a place where 3G connected devices are available to browse net and our view is that the more of web connected devices whether be tablets or smartphones, the better that is for our retails business as you are suggesting and we will figure out the best way to make sure that we may get as easy as possible for customers to purchase from those devices but we think that that\u2019s an exciting opportunity to have a world that looks like that. In terms of your unit question, as you can probably expect, given the growth that we are seeing both in North America and in international from revenue prospective. We are seeing very good growth in units as well and so we are very pleased with the unit growth we are seeing in both segments.\nJeetil Patel: I guess on the former question that I asked about how mobile changes the world, does that give you an advantage as you look at your recommendations capability, what you have been building in terms of that database and kind of cross-comparison of what people are buying in terms of the cross categories and products. And then I guess is it international growth that is incrementally much better on units that\u2019s driving it. It seems like domestic has been good, but international seems to be kicking in even more so these days than ever before?\nTom Szkutak: Again your unit question is related to Mobal or it\u2019s related to total?\nJeetil Patel: Total.\nTom Szkutak: Again that the unit growth is very broad and so again when you see the results that we had with, at local currency basis international being up 37%, this is revenue I\u2019m speaking as well as, North America again was a 47%, 46% on a local currency basis that you\u2019re seeing very revenue growth. You\u2019re also seeing very strong unit growth in those two segments. And in terms of again, in terms of Mobal, we\u2019re going to use obviously try to make sure that we learnt as much as we can and try to serve our customers the best we can in that environment but it\u2019s an environment that we like. Again, the idea of having easy access from a web perspective on a wireless devices, as a world that we like, so again we\u2019re going to do, whatever we can to make sure it\u2019s easy for customers to get access.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Steve Weinstein with Pacific Crest.\nSteve Weinstein: Great, thanks. I don't know if you would be willing to disclose it, but I'm trying to get a better understanding of how much Zappos impacted the quarter. If you could at least give us a sense of what the organic growth would have been without that. But I also would love to know if there is any other impacts to the P&L. I just wanted to make sure the worldwide unit growth of 40% that is excluding Zappos, correct?\nTom Szkutak: No, the worldwide unit growth includes Zappos and the impact, someone had asked a similar question earlier. We are not breaking out Zappos results specifically as part of our total, but what I had mentioned was, if you take a worldwide results on a local currency in a growth basis and you back out Zappos and the Kindle accounting change, you see a growth rate that accelerated from Q4 and that accelerated versus what we saw in Q4 excluding exchange and excluding Zappos.\nOperator: We will go next to Imran Khan with JPMorgan.\nImran Khan: I have two quick modeling questions and then one more of a big picture question. In terms of modeling questions, I think on your other operating expenses/income net was $26 million, could you explain what that was, please? And secondly, fulfillment seems like it came down quite a bit at 7.4% of revenue. Is that sustainable? How should we think about that? And the long-term question is, I think the shareholder letter Jeff talked about how you launched 21 categories worldwide. Can you give us some sense how long it takes to ramp those categories, how long it takes to get to the peak margins now that we have the experience of launching many different categories over the last many, many years?\nTom Szkutak: Can you just repeat there was a part in the middle there that I missed, you said something about 7.4% I didn\u2019t hear.\nImran Khan: That is the fulfillment. Fulfillment as a percentage of revenue, I believe, was 7.4%?\nTom Szkutak: Is your question is related to that.\nImran Khan: Yes, so that is down 80 basis points year over year. So I was trying to figure out if that is a one-time thing or how should we think about it? Is that sustainable, trying to figure out what is driving that leverage?\nTom Szkutak: I start with the fulfillment one first, what you are seeing there is, we saw accelerated growth and when you see accelerated growth we\u2019re able to leverage that in our fulfillment capacity and a great way from a productivity standpoint. Also what I had mentioned was we have added capacity, but specifically in North America we haven't added in a meaningful capacity since Q3 of '08 and if you recall we were building capacity and then we had a financial disruption in the market, so we ended up having some excess capacity in Q4 of '08. We've been to leverage that capacity throughout and so that's resulting in the productivity that you are seeing. Now with the growth that we are experiencing, you should expect that we will have to add capacity overtime here to satisfy that growth. In terms of your category question, we have learned a lot over the years, but it still takes us a number of years to get to scale when we launch new categories. One of the things we've learned over the past several years is, we need to make sure that we have great selections day one. We need to make sure that we are pricing very competitively day one. Even though we don't have necessarily the scale or the buying tools to purchase well day one and so what that means usually is that will have lower contribution profit per unit generally early on and as we learn you know those categories we get better and better at you know sourcing and make sure we have the right inventory in place and all that. So it takes a number of years before you know we get those scale in those categories and get meaningful free cash flow out of them.\nRob Eldridge: Imran, in regards to your question on what\u2019s behind the $26 million of the operating expense. Remember that we are amortizing intangibles in that line I mean there is a number of things that go into that but it really is predominantly amortization intangible assets.\nOperator: We will go next to Benjamin Schachter with Broadpoint AmTech.\nBen Schachter: Well if you could discuss some initiatives around used products and particularly in EGM and what the strategy is there going forward? Another question would be discuss your private label strategy. Are there any new trends there, any new categories that we should know about? And then finally, just for the modeling, was there any meaningful impact from videogame hardware shortages this quarter?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of used products, our strategy there has been you know pretty consistent. We have a platform that is available for sellers to sell used product which is predominant use and we try make that experience as good as we can, both for the sellers and for customers so they can understand you know what the quality of the good is before making a purchase decision. We have done some private label as you mentioned and you know there is not really a lot really to speak of today about that, but again we have, do have some private label product that we sell, but you know the vast majority of the products we sell are not private label.\nOperator: We will go next to Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch\nJustin Post: A couple of things. First, I know your company does not like to waste money. Usually you have a revenue decline into the summer, and you ramp up your facilities and your people kind of in the third quarter. Why earlier this year? Do you feel really bullish as we go into the summer period? And then just to clarify, are you saying all of the acceleration on an ex-currency basis from 1Q versus 4Q is due to Zappos and Kindle amortization?\nTom Szkutak: On a global basis excluding exchange Kindle and the accounting change, we saw a few 100 basis points acceleration and growth so we did accelerate excluding those items. In terms of capacity we do have high growth rates right now. We have 40% unit growth, 46% revenue growth in Q1, you see the guidance for Q2 and so as you would expect with that growth rate we need to make sure we have the right amount of capacity and people on hand to serve. As part of that from a fulfillment perspective, we are growing our fulfilled by Amazon, our FDA business which also requires capacity to do so. So those are things we view as high quality problems but those are things that we certainly will have to add as we move forward as well as other areas, other parts of our business that are growing in addition to those two.\nJustin Post: But you said that you are investing earlier this year than normal, or is it just maybe a little bit of a catch-up to last year? How would you phrase that, would you say?\nTom Szkutak: I guess I would characterize as it is, we\u2019re trying to make sure we, satisfy demand in our retail business and our third party business that we fulfill as well as web services businesses, so those are the things we\u2019re trying to do and making sure that we have the right capacity on hand.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our final question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: A question on e-books. I guess, as you and the industry move more towards the agency model for digital books, it shifts the ability to set pricing to publishers. I guess our understanding is you also have to charge sales tax, also. So it would seem that your ability to leverage low price maybe mitigated a little bit. So I was wondering if you could just talk about how you would adjust your model to differentiate Amazon versus some of the other players in the context of the other two pillars, I guess, convenience and selection that you are focused on?\nTom Szkutak: One of the things that we\u2019re doing is we are expanding selection, pre-dramatically. When we launched two plus years ago, with Kindle we had approximately 90,000 titles. Just recently we passed over 500,000 titles and so our vision is, as we stated when we launched Kindles to have every book ever published in any language available for customers in under 60 seconds and that\u2019s still our stated long-term goal and so we\u2019re going to continue to add selection in support of that vision.\nOperator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rob Eldridge for any additional or closing remarks.\nRob Eldridge: Great. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: And that does conclude today\u2019s call. We appreciate everyone\u2019s participation."}], "2012": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2011, "date": "2012-02-01 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Sean Boyle. Please go ahead, sir.\nSean Boyle: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO; and John Felton, our Director of Investor Relations. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2012, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 12% to $3.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $2.09 billion. Return on invested capital is 22%, down from 34%. Return on invested capital is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 465 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $277 million. Worldwide revenue grew 35% to $17.43 billion, or 34% excluding the $101 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers, who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $6.01 billion, up 15% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.91 billion, up 48%, or 47% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 63% of worldwide sales, up from 57%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 46%. Active customer accounts exceeded $164 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units were 36% of paid units compared to 32% of paid units in Q4 2010. Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.83 billion, or 79.3% of revenue compared with 79.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.14 billion or 18% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.62 billion or 9.3% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and content was $782 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 3.5%. Marketing was $581 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 2.8%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 37% to $9.9 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.56 billion. EGM revenue grew 51% to $6.88 billion, representing 69% of North America revenues, up from 63%. North America segment operating income decreased 4% to $285 million, a 2.9% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $7.53 billion. Adjusting for the $102 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 29%. Media revenue grew 20% to $3.45 billion, or 18% excluding foreign exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 42% to $4.03 billion, or 41% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of international revenues, up from 49%. International segment operating income decreased 46% to $177 million, a 2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income decreased 46%. CSOI decreased 26% to $462 million, or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 216 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 27%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 45% to $260 million, or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $86 million in Q4, resulting in a 32% rate for the quarter and a 31% rate for the full year 2011. GAAP net income was $177 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with $416 million and $0.91 per diluted share. Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 41% to $48.08 billion. North America revenue grew 43% to $26.71 billion, and International grew 38% to $21.37 billion, 31% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Consolidated Segment Operating Income, or CSOI, decreased 19% to $1.57 billion, or 21% excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin decreased 239 basis points to 3.3%. GAAP operating income decreased 39% to $862 million, or 1.8% of net sales. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $814 million year-over-year to $9.58 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $4.99 billion. And inventory turns were 10.3, down from 11.4 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 38% to $11.14 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 74 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q4 2011 capital expenditures were $550 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology, infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q1 2012, we expect net sales between $12 billion and $13.4 billion, a growth of between 22% and 36%. This guidance anticipates approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.  GAAP operating income or loss to be between a loss of $200 million and $100 million of income, or between 162% decline and 69% decline. This includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $300 million, or between 100% decline and 36% decline. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.\nSean Boyle: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from analyst Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank Securities.\nJeetil J. Patel: A couple of questions, actually. First of all, on the Kindle Fire, I guess, Tom, can you maybe talk about Kindle Fire hardware units? Or did you see an increase in terms of unit sales on a month-on-month basis in terms of linearity? Second, as it relates to fulfillment, can you talk about what's your thinking in terms of getting closer to the end consumer and trying to drop delivery times to same-day delivery as you kind of look forward in terms of planning and thinking of what's the optimal experience from a consumer standpoint?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of data related to Kindle Fire and actually Kindle itself, the only thing I can help you with is on the holiday season, which we put in the release. We had a -- our unit sales nearly tripled. It was up 177%, and that includes both our Kindle e-reader and Kindle Fire. So we're very pleased with the great growth we had. And obviously, we've been growing quite fast over the last several years from a unit perspective in launching Kindle. So it's on a very good base. In terms of fulfillment and delivery time, we're continually trying to improve all of our processes around from a customer standpoint, and that includes fulfillment and delivery speed. And so you've seen over the last several years, we've gotten closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint. And when we do that, it not only helps our retail offering, but it helps also our third parties who are participating in Fulfilled by Amazon. And one of the things that you're seeing in our Q4 numbers is we saw very good unit growth. And you're seeing that we expanded our third party as a percentage of total units. And one of the ways we did that is certainly by Fulfilled by Amazon because again, from a customer standpoint, those units are available for express 2-day shipping or 1-day if you're a Prime member and you pay the small fee, as well as our free shipping offers.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from analyst Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.\nScott W. Devitt: Two if I could. The first one, Tom, North American segment sales decelerated, and if you can, adjustment for Kindle Fire, by a pretty good bit. You mentioned third-party mix, which I think is a negative impact on that, and was wondering if you could just talk through the other dynamics if Prime is becoming more mature in the U.S. and/or the agency book business, the mix shift you're having given the strength of the Kindle product, if that's actually having a negative impact on revenue growth?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of our overall -- I'll talk to the total worldwide, as well as to the North America piece. But what I was mentioning was our growth rate for global revenue was 34%, excluding exchange. That compares to 39% in Q3 and 37% last year. If you compare our unit growth, that's a paid unit growth, was 46%. Again this is globally in Q4. That compares to 37% in Q4 last year. So we saw an acceleration in unit growth. On top of that, what we saw was third-party units grew 65% year-over-year, and our third-party units as a percentage of total units were 36%, up from 32%. And so really what you're seeing is you're seeing great adoption. Certainly, great revenue from a third-party perspective. But you're seeing very good adoption of FBA that has grown considerably over the last few years, and that's certainly impacting that number. But obviously, we only book a portion of the revenue based on the commissions we receive for that business and our top line growth. So that's what you're seeing in total. And you're seeing that also happen in North America, as well as International. To the other comments, a few other things to call out in terms of North America. If you take a look at our EGM revenue, certainly there was some impact in certain subcategories related to the Thailand flood. It certainly impacted some supply. Again, the good news is we certainly had some good third-party offerings in many of those subcategories as well. Same as -- another similar fact is in North America media, we saw very, very strong growth in digital media from books to video, music. All of those grew very well. We did see video games, which includes both consoles and games. Keep in mind that Q4 is very seasonal for video games. We actually saw our revenue decline year-over-year in video games. We had very strong third-party offerings, so our third-party growth was up. Our unit growth in video games was up, but our revenue was down. And that's what you're seeing impacting the North American media number, particularly versus Q4 last year. So again, those are some of the dynamics. But again, what you're seeing is some of this, certainly the strong performance on third-party sellers, is also impacting the top line, because we just recorded a portion of that sale, the commission. But you're seeing it positively impact operating income, which is why you see it came in a little bit above the guidance that we gave.\nScott W. Devitt: And as it relates to CapEx, the run rate, if you go back to '05, you were about 2% -- a little over 2% of revenue, and it's been ramping. I know some of the last 2 years this included the building, but we exited 2012 I think at a 3.7% of revenue on a trailing basis. So I was wondering if you can just talk to the way that we should think about CapEx as a percentage of revenue or otherwise over the next few years.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. We look at it certainly on an incremental -- from an incremental growth standpoint. And we look at it versus incremental unit growth, as well as what we think the NPVs for those specific investments are. But if you break down the individual pieces, again, as we've talked about in the last several calls, we've just seen such dramatic growth in both, first of all, from a retail perspective, on our retail offerings, been growing very fast. Our third-party with Fulfilled by Amazon, very fast. AWS has been growing very fast, and so the capacity that we've needed to support both our operations capability, as well as the infrastructure capability for our Web Services and our Retail business has been very high. That said, we feel that we're efficiently deploying that capital. We added -- as we talked about last call, we had planned to add 17 FCs, which is what we did in 2011, bringing our total to 69. And again, that represents the high growth that we're experiencing. So we feel very good about the investments that we're making. And with 46% paid unit growth in Q4, we're still experiencing very high growth.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from analyst Mark Mahaney from the firm of Citi.\nMark S. Mahaney: Tom, just a little more color on that North American media growth. You talked about the unit trends and the revenue trends in video games. Anything you'd want to call out in terms of the other media segments: books, music and video? And then real briefly, the share buybacks. I think this is the first time in at least 2 years you've done that. Any particular reason why you brought back stock in the quarter?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the North American media, again, across all of digital media, very strong growth. Another call-out that I didn't mention is physical books. Unit growth was double digit in Q4 year-over-year, which we were very pleased with if you think about the shift to digital content and just the really rapid growth on the Kindle side. We were pleased to see that. And then I'd mentioned the video games was again down from a revenue perspective. Third-party GMS was up strongly. Unit growth in total for video games was up. Again, there's some difficult compares as you can imagine with some of the console piece of that. And again, when I talk video games, it's both console and video games. And keep in mind that video games in particular is very seasonal, and usually, we see in Q4, and we did see this Q4 as well as other Q4s, that video games sales for the quarter is multiples of what we see in other quarters, again because of the seasonality. So hopefully that's helpful. And then in terms of the stock purchase, we've had a -- there's not a lot to comment there. We have said in the past that we'll opportunistically buy when we think it's the right value, and that's what we did.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from analyst Spencer Wang from the firm of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: Tom, 2 quick questions. One is, I think the new disclosure on service sales, maybe I missed the footnote in the press release, could you just clarify what's included there? Is that 3P, FBA, Prime, AWS and shipping? Or did I maybe miss something? And then secondly, can you share with us maybe your plans for how many fulfillment centers you plan on opening in 2012?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the disclosure, I would want to guide you right to the release to see exactly what's included in there. But certainly, in terms of some of the big pieces, it is our third-party. It is also AWS and a number of other service offerings. And so those are again documented well there, and I'd like to point you to that. Also, you can see that it's growing very well, and it reflects on the comments I made earlier about the fast-growing AWS businesses, the fast-growing third-party business. Service revenue is up approximately 74% year-over-year in Q4. And then in terms of fulfillment, we added 17 new FCs in 2011. That's globally. We do plan, based on the strong growth, to add more in 2012. As you can imagine, coming out of Q4, we're finalizing our plans for what we're going to do there. And you'll have to stay tuned, and we'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company as the firm.\nYoussef H. Squali: So going back to the media question, Tom, can you maybe just help us quantify the video games revenue impact, maybe just on the level of deceleration? We would've thought that maybe with the launch of Kindle Fire, et cetera, we would've seen maybe a higher attach rate and therefore, maybe a higher media revenue growth. And second, just on the streaming service, any plans to separate -- to offer separate pricing for the video streaming product? And that's it.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes, just to be clear, I'm separating our digital -- when I talk about our growth rates, I'm talking about our digital content businesses across-the-board grew very strongly during Q4. The video games, physical, as well as consoles business, again grows. It's just seasonally very high. It's not -- if you take a look at it, it's not too dissimilar to what you'd see with our electronics portion of our EGM business. It's a very seasonal business, very heavy weighted in Q4. And so that's no different. That's not different this year than in other years. What is different is growth was down from a revenue perspective year-over-year. It was up from a units perspective. And again, the reason why it was up is because we had strong third-party sales in Q4. Keep in mind though, certainly console is a part of that. And again, we include consoles and video games as part of our video games line within North America media. And you've probably seen other press related to that as you look at other releases and updates. But there has been a lot of new offerings there recently.\nYoussef H. Squali: And on the video streaming?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I'm sorry, what was your question on that? Could you repeat it again?\nYoussef H. Squali: Just on the video streaming side, trying to figure out whether there are any other short-term plans to offer -- to strip that out basically from Kindle from the Prime and offer it as a standalone offering?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Well, for digital video, we have a couple different offerings. One is a paid or rental offering as part of Amazon Video. We also have a service as part of Prime. We like both of them. We made some -- we put some comments in the release about the growth rates associated with those. And on the Prime that's in Video, we actually like what we see there also. And so it's still early, but we like what we see. We are investing in digital content. We're seeing great adoption. We're looking at it very carefully to understand a lot of different metrics around that business as you'd expect. And it's still early again. We really like what we see so far. We're going to continue to monitor it closely, but we will be continuing to add content there.\nOperator: And our next question is coming from analyst Heather Bellini with firm, Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about any cannibalization you think you saw in traditional Kindle readers as a result of the Fire launch. And subsequently, how are you feeling about the Prime conversion of the Fire units versus your expectations?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of both devices, meaning the readers and Fire, did very well and we're very pleased with the growth we're seeing there. And that's part of the -- both are included in the growth rate that we had in our release, which is again during the holiday season. It was up 177% year-over-year. And again, we've been growing certainly our Kindle reader business very fast over the past several years since introduction. And so it's on top of a good base. And so we're pleased with the growth rate, and customers like both the reader and the Fire. Early to tell on Prime conversion. But again, early stats that we're seeing, we like a lot. And so we'll continue to see how that looks going forward, but we like what we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from analyst Justin Post with firm Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Your headcount growth in the quarter was 67%, which is quite a bit higher than units or revenue growth. Can you talk about what all those people are focused on, maybe a couple of the bigger areas? And is there are day coming when you could envision that kind of slowing to below either unit or revenue growth with maybe the timeframe on that?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. First thing is we are investing in a lot of different areas across the business, as we've talked about. That being said, when you look at that increase that you're referring to, the majority of those increases are in our operations and customer service area. And so again, it's in support of the growth. And certainly, you're seeing it also in our operating costs. And again, we're fortunate to have a lot of opportunities. We're fortunate to have the growth that we're experiencing, and that's why you're seeing that growth. But certainly, you'll see that. As you have over time, you'll see that growth rate will go in cycles. But we certainly are feeding the growth that we're seeing and the opportunities that we have.\nOperator: And our next question is coming from Jordan Rohan with the firm Stifel, Nicolaus.\nJordan Rohan: So I'm trying to better understand the guided range for 1Q. And specifically, I'm looking at 2 things. First, the impact of currency and really more macro weakness in Western Europe. Are you seeing anything there? Is there anything that makes you think that things could be getting materially worse in any of your territories? And specific language around which of the countries you may be seeing could be quite helpful. And second, I'm wondering if you are seeing, or have seen over the course of the last quarter, a shift of consumer buying habits towards the hardware device sales and away from media, and perhaps that could explain the deceleration in the media that we appear to be seeing in North America.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of international growth or in terms of, first of all, your question on guidance and the impact of exchange, we have a modest assumption around exchanges. Again, we're using the recent exchange rates. But the range for growth was 22% to 36%, and it was unfavorably impacting us by about 50 basis points for foreign exchange. In terms of growth in, you mentioned Western Europe, if you take a look at International in Q4, it was up 29% on a local-currency basis. It did hold up pretty well given obviously the challenges that are going on, specifically in Europe from an economic standpoint. We're not -- we don't view ourselves as a bellwether for the economy, but certainly we're seeing that it is softer. Hard to quantify how much higher that international growth would have been. But it was certainly -- we're all seeing the same thing in terms of the reports in Europe and it's certainly soft. So it is impacting our overall growth rate, but hard to tell how much. And then on the -- again on the North America media growth, it's actually again very, very strong on the digital content side. Physical books were up double digits from a unit perspective, which we thought was impressive given the shift to Kindle. And again, video games and video game consoles were certainly the biggest call-out there from a negative standpoint. And that growth was down year-over-year on a revenue basis but up from a unit perspective.\nOperator: Our next question is from analyst Gene Munster with the firm of Piper Jaffray.\nCharles Eugene Munster: If we just take a step back and look at this from a high level, over the last couple of years, you've been making significant investments in the business, and it's been paying off with just some impressive growth numbers off of what have been larger and larger numbers. And I think the big surprise for investors tonight is just what appears to be a diminishing return on that investment. And I don't know if you can use this as a forum to kind of address that concern.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes, I'm not sure how to answer that, or exactly what you mean. What I would say is we have been investing very heavily as you mentioned. And as a result of that, Q4 unit growth was 46% year-over-year. That's paid unit growth. And we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. And yes, there's some pockets of softness or challenges with some of the economic impact, particularly in Europe. We did see some supply issues with the Thailand flood, with certainly some subcategories within some of our hard lines businesses as a result. We think those things will work themselves out over time. But we're incredibly optimistic about the opportunity that we have, and that's why we have invested the way we have and why we're continuing to invest in the business. So we're very pleased to see it and very pleased to have the opportunities that we have in front of us.\nCharles Eugene Munster: Okay. So your outlook in terms of investment philosophy hasn't changed versus last quarter going forward.\nThomas J. Szkutak: No, no. We're continuing to look. As we always do, we learn every week and every month and every quarter about more and more about customer adoption. And we're looking at just a lot of positive things across the business in terms of adoption of our digital offerings, very specifically Kindle growth from a device standpoint and the content that's following that. And we're seeing some very strong growth along many categories. If you look at EGM, we're seeing very good growth in categories like soft lines, particularly clothing. We're seeing very good growth in consumables. We're seeing very good growth outside of some of these supply-constrained areas. Within consumer electronics, we're seeing good growth. So there's a lot of positive things within EGM. Within our business, we're seeing just tremendous growth in Amazon Web Services, so I'm very pleased with how the team is doing there, and they're just doing a great job. And so there's a lot of interesting opportunities that we continue to invest in. So we're very pleased, and we're very pleased with the performance in Q4 and what it means going forward for us.\nOperator: Our last question is from analyst Doug Anmuth with the firm of JP Morgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: Just a couple things. So you're obviously building a lot into Prime with video and also the Kindle Lending Library. Can you just give us a sense of how the profitability of a Prime customer changes over time? And then also, if you could comment more specifically on the early returns on sort of the media rate -- media purchases as it relates to Kindle Fire owners specifically?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In each of our video -- excuse me, in each of our digital contents that we're offering, whether it be as part of Prime, whether it be Lending Library or whether it be video, we just have early results. And so from a return perspective, we're going to see -- what we can see so far is what's happening with adoption of Prime members, what's happening with free trial conversion, what's happening with Prime memberships that we can attribute directly to those services. And again, it's very, very early. But so far, we see, we like, which is why we're continuing down the path specifically of adding more content to Prime and making Prime better. And so that's something that we, over time, we've learned both with our physical offerings and now early on in our digital offering, it's something that we think is very good for customers and very good for share owners. And so that's something that we're focused a lot on. Because we're investing a lot there, we are taking a very close look at and making sure that we understand it very well. And from what we see so far, it supports a continued strong investment there. And so that's what we're doing. But again, we'll continue to monitor that very closely. And over time, we'll be sharing more about how we're doing there.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Boyle, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nSean Boyle: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2011, "date": "2011-10-26 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Third Quarter 2011 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. John Felton. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Felton: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views, as of today, October 25, 2011, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments in our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 19% to $3.11 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $1.53 billion. Return on invested capital is 17%, down from 28%. Return on invested capital is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter end. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares compared with 465 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 44% to $10.88 billion or 39%, excluding the $371 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage for our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $4.15 billion, up 24% or 19%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $6.32 billion, up 59% or 54%, excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 58% of worldwide sales, up from 53%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 53%. Active customer accounts exceeded 152 million. Worldwide active sellers were more than 2 million. Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $8.32 billion or 76.5% of revenue consistent with the prior-year period. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.29 billion or 21.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.09 billion or 10% of revenue compared with 8.7%. Tech and content was $694 million or 6.4% of revenue compared with 5.1%. Marketing was $360 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 3.1%. Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments or stock-based type of compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North American segment, revenue grew 44% to $5.93 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $1.93 billion. EGM revenue grew 56% to $3.64 billion, representing 51% of North American revenues, up from 56%. North America segment operating income decreased 23% to $144 million, a 2.4% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 44% to $4.94 billion, adjusting for the $367 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 33%. Media revenue grew 27% to $2.23 billion or 17% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 63% to $2.68 million or 51%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of international revenues up from 48%. International segment operating income decreased 46% to $116 million, a 2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 55%. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 35% to $260 million or 2.4% of revenue down approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $14 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 38%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income include stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 71% to $79 million or 0.7% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $67 million in Q3, resulting in a 52% rate for the quarter and a 31% rate year-to-date. GAAP net income was $63 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared with $231 million and $0.51 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $441 million year-over-year to $6.33 billion. Inventory increased 50% to $3.77 billion and inventory turns were 10.8, down from 11.8 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 42% to $6.55 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 72 from 73 in the prior year. Our Q3 2011 capital expenditures were $529 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web services and capacity to support our fulfillment operations. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the trends that we've seen to date, and what we believed today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters in changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q4 2011, we expect net sales between $16.45 billion and $18.65 billion or growth between 27% and 44%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $200 million loss and $250 million of income are between a 142% decline and 47% decline. This includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $0 and $450 million or between 100% decline and 28% decline. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to creating lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, John, let's move to questions.\nJohn Felton: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Mark Mahaney with Citi.\nMark S. Mahaney: I wonder if you would talk a little bit more about the revenue guide for the fourth quarter? And just some basic factual things, are you including contributions from the Kindle Fire shipments? And do you fully recognize all of that or is there some ratable recognition? And is there any particular reason, in addition to that, that you're guiding for a deceleration? Are you seeing signs of softening consumer demand in European markets, for example?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the guidance for revenue for Q4, as we've done in previous years, we've given a wide range of guidance in Q4 just because of the seasonality and it's difficult to predict. But we feel very good about the demand that we've seen to date. And certainly, at the high end of the guidance, you can see there's an acceleration that's possible that's reflected in that guidance. But we are given a wide range consistent with what we've done in prior Q4s. In terms of the overall growth that we've seen so far, to date, you saw a very strong growth in Q3, up 39% on a local currency basis. That's consistent with what we've seen over the past 12 months where we're up 39%, also over the trailing 12 months. And we really saw a step change 2 years ago where last [indiscernible] year-over-year so far last 12 months up 39%. So again, we feel very good about the growth that we are experiencing, and I've seen data reflected in the guidance given a wide range. In terms of Kindle Fire in our guidance and certainly  the largest portion of that would be reflected in our revenue.\nOperator: We'll go next to Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company.\nYoussef H. Squali: Tom, could you please speak to what's pressuring margins in Q3 and particularly Q4. I guess the implied margin for Q4 is effectively 0 at the midpoint. It, again, answer the question, what's the financial model going forward? Is it to try to maximize growth on the top line even at 0 growth -- 0 margin?\nThomas J. Szkutak: What you're seeing, and again, it relates back to the growth, we're  seeing really unprecedented growth. We're seeing the best growth which we've seen since 2000, meaning in 2010 and so far over the past 12 months ending September. And so with this strong growth, we're investing in a lot of capacity and that's what we've been talking about over the past couple of quarters and that's what you're seeing in our Q3 results specifically. If you take a look at our operating expenses in Q3, as a percentage of revenue, you see -- and if you compare that to Q2, as a percentage of revenue, you're seeing very similar trends for marketing and G&A. You're seeing a slight uptick in tech content. It's about 10 basis points and then you're seeing fulfillment up approximately 80 basis points. The reason why that's growing so much, as a percentage of revenue, is again the capacity that we've been talking about. Many days ago, I've mentioned that we were -- we had announced 15 new fulfillment centers this year that's on a basis of 52 from last year. And then we'd likely open one or two more. We are  actually going to be opening 17 new fulfillment centers. And so you're seeing that impacting our fulfillment expense in Q3, as well as the bottom line in Q3. So that's what's impacting this in Q3. We are also investing in a number of different areas. We're investing to support retail growth fulfilled by Amazon growth, fast-growing AWS business, as well as infrastructure to support our retail business. We're investing in our Kindle and Digital business. I mean you're seeing that reflected in our Q4 guidance as well, all of these things. And so if you take a look at our Kindle business, for example, we've launched 4 new products at the end of September, and we're very, very excited about those products. They're at great prices, and they are certainly premium products. And so we're very excited about those. And we think about the economics of the Kindle business, we think about the totality. We think of the lifetime value of those devices. So we're not just thinking about the economics of the device and the accessories. We're thinking about the content. We are selling quite a bit of Special Offers devices which includes ads. We're thinking about the advertisement and those Special Offers and those lifetime values. So those are the things certainly that are impacting, as well as investments in other areas impacting our Q4 guidance. But we feel very good about where we are right now and the opportunities that we have in front of us.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.\nScott W. Devitt: Tom, just a bigger picture question on the Retail business. I was wondering how you're thinking about individual markets in cases where specific markets are highly competitive and markets where you maybe position potentially as the #2. Do you, long-term in markets such as that do you believe that the business should be positioned as #1 and that the scale advantage has deteriorated if you're not a #1. Just wondering given some of the emerging markets and the competitive landscape that's occurring, particularly in Asia. How  you think about that?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. We're -- maybe to step back from it a bit. Whenever we enter a new geography or even a new category, we're trying to make sure that it's something that we can, we think we can add value to. And so, for example, we like categories that have a lot of different SKUs that are complicated in a physical retail environment. We like categories where there is, we think that we can add a lot of value from a service perspective. And so in each of the categories that we operate in, we're always trying to make sure that we can -- we think we can get great returns on invested capital over a period of time. And so I'm not directly answering your question, but we certainly look at it on a category-by-category basis. We look at it where we can add value. And if you look back over of our history, you can see where we've entered new categories, new geographies. We've always started with the customer first. We've added  selection usually first from a retail standpoint. Sometimes with third parties it starts, sometimes not. But we've added third parties as we've gone if we haven't done it what we started. And so this is -- we think this model has worked very well for us. And again, we're  looking always at ways that we can add value for customers and shareholders over time.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company.\nJames H. Friedland: I wanted to ask about -- you with Netflix launching. We're announcing that they're launching in the U.K. and Ireland with streaming. You guys bought Lovefilm earlier in the year and it doesn't seem like you've changed the streaming side of the business that much. Are there any plans to ramp up the investment and content outside the U.S., outside of what you're doing with Prime streaming? And then on Quidsi, we've seen a lot of new announcements in terms of new brands and also new categories. Is that having a material impact on some of the lower operating profiters. Quidsi is just not big enough as a percentage of total to matter?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of Lovefilm, actually we have been investing in content since acquisition. So that's something we have been doing and we continue to invest there and you'd expect -- you should expect us to continue to invest in Lovefilm. We think it's a graded opportunity. The business is doing very well. We're very pleased with how the team is working and we're very excited about that opportunity. So that's something we have been doing since acquisition. And you should expect that to continue. In terms of Quidsi, yes, they are continuing to expand, doing a very nice job. That is not -- it certainly reflected in the guidance that we're giving for Q4. I wouldn't consider that a material impact.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.\nRoss Sandler: Just two quick questions. First on U.S. EGM, there was a bit more deceleration there than  prior quarters. I know that comp was more challenging, but can you give us a little color on what's going on with the deceleration in domestic EGM? And then a question on mobile, our smart phone and tablet users that are buying physical goods on the Amazon mobile app, how does their purchase behavior differ from the same users who are buying stuff on PC? Are they buying more physical goods or less, not ebooks or digital goods, but just specifically physical goods?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the first part of your question, we are very pleased with the growth rate we saw in North America EGM. It was up 56% year-over-year. And you do have it right. It is a bit of a tough compare if you look back to last year. We did grow 80%. It was certainly high watermark for us and we're overlapping that. We had very, very strong growth last year Q3. But again, still very pleased with what we see in Q3 of this year in EGM specifically and our overall growth rates, too. In terms of mobile, we actually haven't released a lot of details and that's not much I can help you with there. But certainly, we are seeing good trends in our mobile business. And again, we like what we're  seeing there, but there's not much I can help you with that particular question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank Securities.\nJeetil J. Patel: A couple of questions. First of all, I guess on lifetime value, if you look at the Kindle kind of customer versus the core retail customer, can you talk about whether lifetime value is comparable or higher, relative to that core business? If you can isolate it that way? And second, as you look at the third-party business, are you seeing an accelerated mixed shift towards third-party broadly? And is there anything -- any particular markets or kind of international that seems to be seeing a bigger pickup in the third-party side of the business?\nThomas J. Szkutak: To answer your first -- the first part of your question, we're not breaking out Kindle customer versus non-Kindle customer, but I can talk a little bit about some of the dynamics related specifically to the Kindle customer. We have learned a lot over the past couple of years about -- since launching Kindle. Once a customer's purchased a device, obviously, what else do they buy. And what they launch  more recently of special offers and ad-based Kindles. We certainly have some data and we're still learning, but have some data that we didn't have prior to launch. And so what we're seeing certainly is that once customers purchase a Kindle and are carrying around this really massive selection at their fingertips, they're buying more content. We've talked a lot about that on previous calls. But again as we think about the lifetime value, we thinking very specifically about the device itself. How to make sure that we get just the absolute device in customers -- the absolute best device in customers hands and have the absolute best content on those devices. And we look at the total economics which include the device, the accessories, the content, as well as any ad-based revenue and Special Offers. So those are the things that we're looking at, as we think about the lifetime value of the device. And we like what we see. And so certainly as you think about Q4 and you think about the guidance that we're giving, certainly we're going to have a -- we expect to have a record quarter in terms of device sales. And because of the back-end loading of it, you should assume that the content would, obviously, trail that device sale. The ad revenue would trail those device sales as well as the Special Offers. So those are the things you should think about as you think about our Kindle business. But we're extremely excited about it both our electronic ink and fire devices and couldn't be more pleased to offer those for customers and we think that those will be great for share owners over time. In terms of third-party, we think the business is going very well, in terms of the numbers. Our third-party units, as a percentage of total units, these are paid units, as a percentage of total units is 38% this quarter, up from 35% last year. So we're very pleased also on top  have very strong overall unit growth, so we're  very pleased with what we're seeing there. And this is a trend that's been -- you've seen for a number of years now, where we're getting both great retail growth, as well as third-party growth. And certainly fulfilled by Amazon and other things that are helping drive that growth rate.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: So I guess one question and a couple of parts related to digital content. Tom I was wondering if you could just perhaps give us a sense of how much of the increase in operating costs in the fourth quarter do you think will be driven by digital content rights? Should we expect that to continue to drag on into 2012? And then just to clarify, how are you accounting for the streaming content rights? Is that under FAS 63?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of content, we will be certainly purchasing content for both our U.S. business which includes a paid piece and a Prime instant video which will be an unpaid piece free as long as you're a Prime member. And so those -- so the content is included in our Q4. In addition to that, we also have content costs as we have with Lovefilm in Europe, so those are included in our guidance. We are not splitting out the specific dollar amount related to that in our guidance for Q4. But it's certainly impacting our guidance, along with, certainly investing in our Kindle business and some of the other investments that I talked about. So those are the things that are impacting us, and we're excited to -- for those opportunities.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie Group.\nBenjamin A. Schachter: So my understanding is that Google will be the default search engine for the Kindle Fire. But will the Silk browser have any type of interface or search bar that links directly to either physical product or media directly from Amazon? And then just separately, on the video distribution, you're still not on the game consoles. Any update on why and would you consider deploying any device like a Roku box or anything else directly to prime customers so that they can get video content to a [indiscernible]?\nThomas J. Szkutak: It'll  be very easy on Fire to access all of our digital content at first. So it's very integrated device. It's something that we've been working on. It's coming together over long period of time, in terms of being able to offer just a vast amount of paid and free content. In the case of video, we'll certainly have  book content, music content. So it will be a very -- our App Store as well. So it will be very easy and very integrated being able to access all of our digital content. It'll  also be easy to access physical product as well. So those are things that we're very excited about, and customers will be able to see when they receive their Fire. And so we think it's an incredible product. We're very excited about it. It's certainly a premium product. And at $1.99, it's certainly not a premium price. We're  very happy to offer that to customers. In terms of other things we might do, I don't have anything to speak of there.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Herman Leung with Susquehanna.\nHerman Leung: Two quick questions. First, I guess on the Target cost drop, I think Target drop -- is dropping basically in August. So wondering what the impact of that is from a onetime cost standpoint in the third and fourth quarters. And then the second quick question is on the distribution center ramp, the 17 new distribution centers that you're adding, how long would it take for those distribution centers to operate at normalized levels similar to your 52 other distribution centers?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of Target, we're not breaking out any specific partner relationship. But certainly, in terms of you have the timing right, in terms of that did happen during Q3. We're  very fortunate to be able to partner with Target over a number of years and so we're very happy to have done that, and so that relationship ended from a partnering of their website in Q3. And any associated impact has been reflected in our actual results for Q3 and our guidance for Q4.  And then in terms of the FCs, the way you should think about it is think about just the sheer ramp up of going from 52 to 69 FCs in a year. It's happening very fast. We have a fantastic team around the world who has been working very hard, making sure that we're up and running, and we have all of our associates train. That being said, as you can imagine, we're having people come in well before starting fulfillment for training. We are signing leases and getting product available for shipment well before doing so. And so, consequently, just as a result of having a ramp up where they'll  be no output for some period of time even though we'll have people in building someplace and moving, receiving product in as productive downtime. And then there's a timeframe where it takes to ramp up during -- from a distribution standpoint. And so all these things will take time. It's something that we have been doing since the start of Amazon. It's something that I think we understand very well, and it takes a period of time depending upon the FC and how automated it is or non automated it is. So those -- all of those factors, we certainly understand well and we'll certainly feel very good about deploying those assets and get great returns on invested capital on those assets over time.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS.\nBrian J. Pitz: Just two quick questions. Would you provide any color on current traction with the Cloud Player and/or usage of Prime video? And going forward, is there any chance that we could see the video service unbundled from Prime perhaps with a standalone fee? I know it's kind of a forward look but it's just how -- can we think about -- how can we think about that?\nThomas J. Szkutak: We're happy with the traction we're getting, both the Cloud Player and Prime video -- both from very early. In terms of Prime video, customers absolutely love it. It's free video. We're adding a lot of content there. We have a lot of customers who are requesting free trials, and then the converting base on those free trials. This is the Prime trials. And so it's very early. And it's something that we'll be adding to, certainly, over the course of the next 12 months and we feel very good about that. But we're also monitoring it very carefully, and we're watching all of the customer-facing metrics that we can, as well as looking at the economics. So that we feel that it's very early, but we like what we see so far.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: Two things. First, Tom, we've seen in the past sometimes when companies make changes to the site, in terms of the UI that it can take customers a little time to get adjusted to those. Can you comment on what you're seeing in the early impact on your site and how that plays into the 4Q? If it does at all? And then secondly, can you comment on whether you're paying any royalties around the Kindle Fire?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the UI, there's not a lot I can say there. It's certainly that's probably the most recent data would be to look at our Q3 results. We didn't have the new UI at 100% for the full quarter. But again, we saw a very strong growth rate in Q3. As I've mentioned earlier, up 39%, so we feel very good about it and it's certainly reflected in our actual results in our guidance as I've mentioned earlier. If you think about Q4, we think we'll have certainly, we've added a lot of selections over the past 12 months, a lot of great unique selection, so we think we are well positioned for Q4 from a selection standpoint. We continue to make sure that our prices are sharp, so we have great value to customers. We continue to work on improving service levels that comes in a number of different forms, but certainly getting goods to customers fast is important and certainly Prime is playing a key role on that and we have certainly a lot more Prime members this year than we have previously. So all of those things we have 4 new Kindle products at just great prices for customers. So all those attributes set up Q4 for a nice growth quarter. Although as we have another Q4 because again our -- but again, we feel very, very good about the growth that we're  seeing over the past quarter and our prospects for the holiday season. And that's reflected in the guidance that we're giving. And in terms of specifics on royalties and everything, we certainly wouldn't talk to that.\nOperator: We'll go next to Colin Sebastian with R.W. Baird.\nColin A. Sebastian: Just one follow-up on the fulfillment centers, Tom. I think you mentioned before that you might need to increase beyond the 15 new centers if revenue growth were faster than originally expected. If you could confirm that, that was the thought process here as well looking into Q4? And then just on the Kindle Fire and EE  devices based on your comments on sales trends thus far, is there any potential supply constraints that you foresee for the holiday period?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the first part, in terms of fulfillment centers, yes. As I mentioned 90 days ago, we've given a range of guidance for the top line for Q3. We hadn't given guidance for Q4. We were very excited about the growth that we were seeing through the first half of the year, but we wanted to get through Q3. And again, I'd announced or had mentioned that 90 days ago that we had announced that we were opening 15 and potentially 1 or 2 more. And that reality is coming true. We are actually opening up 17. And so -- and again, that illustrates we feel about -- how we feel about, not the growth that's happened in the past. But certainly impacting how we're thinking about it, but it impacts the fulfillment we're adding is about growth going forward. And so we feel very good about the growth they're  experiencing and we're looking at a number of different factors, including our most recent historical growth rates. In terms of supply, you probably saw the release. But again, in the first 3 weeks since launch, orders for our EE  Kindles are double the previous launch. We're also seeing extremely strong Kindle Fire pre-orders and we're increasing capacity in building millions more than already planned. And so that's what we're doing from a production standpoint, and we're getting ready as you'd expect for just a great holiday season for customers overall and for Kindle customers.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.\nMatthew R. Nemer: First, your employee count is up about 19% sequentially versus a move of about 10% over the last few years. So I'm wondering, is this quarter and next quarter when you hire a lot of temporary workers  sort of the apex of the pain that you'll feel on all these new FCs or do you think that employee growth could actually accelerate in the first half of next year? And then secondly, your shipping costs were also up pretty significantly, how much of that is Prime usage versus Prime customer acquisition cost?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of employment, we're not guiding or giving estimates beyond the quarter. But you're right, we're seeing a large sequential increase in employment and a large year-over-year increase in employment, and it's across many different areas that we're adding. But certainly the most notable, both from a year-over-year and sequential and certainly represents the majority of the additions would be our operations and customer service associates. And so those are certainly growing fast, and we're also -- given the opportunity that we have to grow. We're also investing in other areas. But again, the majority of the sequential and year-over-year increase is coming from operations and customer service associates. In terms of the shift margin as you're mentioning, certainly, Prime is certainly having a big impact there. And so as well as our free shipping offers and so that's what's -- that certainly what's driving it.\nOperator: And we have time for one final question, we'll go to Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.\nKerry K. Rice: I know that you guys launched in Spain this quarter or towards the end of Q3 beginning of Q4. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the additional international strategy? Shall we think of that as the first step further into Europe or maybe into Latin America?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the 2 most recent country launches, we're certainly Spain and Italy and it's very early. It's a -- we're very happy to be, certainly, serving those geographies. We're very excited about it and think they're  very interesting long-term opportunities. We have, we're able to take advantage of our European infrastructure and leadership team to launch those 2 geographies, and we're very excited about it.\nJohn Felton: Great. Well, thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least to the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: That does concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2011, "date": "2011-07-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. John Felton. Please go ahead.\nJohn Felton: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2011 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views, as of today, July 26, 2011, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Szkutak: Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 25% to $3.21 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow decreased 8% to $1.83 billion. Return on invested capital is 21%, down from 34%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 465 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 51% to $9.91 billion or 44%, excluding the $477 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $3.66 billion, up 27% or 20% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $5.89 billion, up 69% or 62%, excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 59% of worldwide sales, up from 53%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 56% compared to 45% paid unit growth in Q1 2011. Active customer accounts exceeded $144 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units were 36% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q1 2011 and 34% of paid units in Q2 2010. Now, I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $7.52 billion or 75.9% of revenue compared with 75.5%. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $2 billion or 20.2% of sales, up approximately 190 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $909 million or 9.2% of revenue compared with 8.5%. Tech and content was $624 million or 6.3% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $331 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 3.1%. Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 51% to $5.41 billion. Adjusting for the $3 million year-over-year of favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 50%. Media revenue grew 20% to $1.58 billion. EGM revenue grew 67% to $3.5 billion, representing 65% of North America revenues, up from 58%. North America segment operating income increased 7% to $214 million, a 4% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 51% to $4.51 billion, adjusting for the $473 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 36%. Media revenue grew 34% to $2.07 billion or 20%, excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 71% to $2.4 billion or 53%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 53% of international revenues, up from 47%. International segment operating income decreased 16% to $172 million, a 3.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 34%. CSOI decreased 5% to $386 million or 3.9% of revenue, down 229 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $28 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 12%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 25% to $201 million or 2% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $49 million in Q2, resulting in a 22% rate for the quarter and a 26% rate year-to-date. GAAP net income was $191 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with $207 million and $0.45 per diluted share. Second quarter 2011 net income was positively impacted by equity method investment activity of $15 million, including the $49 million gain on sale of an equity position partially offset by $34 million in losses from equity method investments. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.25 billion year-over-year to $6.36 billion. Inventory increased 66% to $3.23 billion and inventory turns were 11.3, down from 12.5 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 61% to $5.72 billion and accounts payable days increased to 69 from 65 in the prior year. Our Q2 2011 capital expenditures were $433 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q3 2011, we expect net sales between $10.3 billion and $11.1 billion or growth of between 36% and 47%. This guidance anticipates approximately 450 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $20 million and $170 million or between 93% decline and 37% decline. This includes approximately $180 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $200 million and $350 million or between a 50% decline and a 13% decline. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, John, let's move to questions.\nJohn Felton: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company.\nJames Friedland: I wanted to ask a question about how you think about ROI and free cash flow, as you invest really aggressively to support this 50% growth. We are seeing free cash flow levels depressed in the near term. And how long can this -- do you expect this to continue? If you keep grabbing shares, should we continue to expect pressure, in terms of free cash flow? Just trying to get a sense of how we should think about incremental capital invested.\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. In terms of how we think about these investments. Our approach has been pretty consistent over the years. If you look at the, as you mentioned, the strong growth, this is the strongest growth we've had from a quarterly perspective year-over-year and over 10 years. And as a result of that, as we look forward, there's a requirement for a lot of capacity and it's something I talked about on previous calls. And if you think about our capacity, it comes in a number of different forms. First of all, our core Retail business. We need both fulfillment capacity, as well as infrastructure capacity. This is something that we've been doing really since our inception and I look at it as a high quality problem. We have a -- if you back out cash and marketable securities, you see that we have a high ROIC. I'm not saying that's really a historical performance, it's not necessarily a predictive performance, but I do feel very good about those investments. Those are something that we've done before. And it's something that we've been working to perfect really since we opened our doors back in the mid-90s. In terms of there's another set of investments certainly you're seeing we're investing in the conversion from physical to digital. We think we have good assets to do that. We're very focused on the customer experience. And that comes in a number of different forms. We feel very good about those investments in terms of the traction that we're getting from a customer standpoint. And we're certainly optimistic about our ability to generate good free cash flow while high returns on invested capital. Then we have some newer businesses. I say newer, they've been with us for several years, but at least they weren't since inception like beyond the digital initiatives like Web services. That's a business that we're investing in. We have great traction. The team has done a terrific job there. And we continue to improve that business, and it's growing very fast. And that's -- you're seeing capital requirements for that business. So that's a business that the team is operating very carefully. They're looking at best ways to improve return on invested capital over time, and we think that's a great big space to be investing in, and we think it's good for that customer set. And it's good for, we hope it to be good for customers over the long term.\nJames Friedland: And then just quickly on the investment in AWS it looks like the tech and content line has been accelerating and the q over q ramp was pretty meaningful again in Q2. Is that -- is the primary driver there AWS or is it a mix of things?\nThomas Szkutak: It's a mix of things but certainly AWS would be a big piece of that, along with our infrastructure to support our Retail business. When I say our Retail business, I mean everything but AWS. So again, think of it as the infrastructure cost to support those 2 businesses. There certainly are other investments we're making that are in that line item, but certainly, those are two big pieces.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Spencer Wang with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: Tom, just a 2 part question on media and then a housekeeping question. On media, the revenue growth there reaccelerated pretty nicely from the last couple of quarters. Is there anything you would call out there, in terms of driving that reacceleration? Any sort of specific categories? And then the second part, I know it's still relatively early days for Prime Instant Video, but I was wondering if you could share with us some of the metrics you see and the impact on Prime membership. And then just last on the housekeeping question, how much were acquisitions to revenue growth in 2Q and in your 3Q guidance?\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. In terms of media, it was pretty broad across the board. Certainly, you're seeing great growth in our digital products, including Kindle that's represented there. The other thing to call out just from a sequential standpoint as you look at international specifically. We did see -- and this is reflected in the total growth rate for international, as well as the media growth rate. We did see an acceleration from Q1 to Q2 for our Japan business. We had talked about last time being soft given the events there, that our team there has done a terrific job serving customers, so we have seen the growth rates return more favorably from first quarter. They're not quite where they were last year but certainly they've -- we've seen an acceleration there, so that is also impacting our global media growth rates and it shows up in our International segment. In terms of Prime Instant Video, we're measuring, as you'd expect, a number of different things for that business. It's very early right now. There's not a lot I can share with you. What I can say though is we like what we've seen so far. We're continuing to invest there, and right now we're seeing customers love it, and it's early. So again, that's something that we'll continue to focus on. And then your third question in terms of acquisitions impact. For Q2, the most recent acquisitions for Quidsi and Lovefilm, that impact year-over-year for those two acquisitions, is a little over 200 basis points, approximately 220 basis points. We had a small amount in Q1. So if you're looking at it sequentially, assume it was about 30 basis points in Q1, and a little over 200 basis points in Q2. Again those are both year-over-year numbers impact for those acquisitions as Lovefilm was about half a quarter in Q1. In terms of bottom-line impact or CSOI and operating income for Q2, CSOI was about negative 19, for GAAP operating income, it was negative 27. That's for Q2. In terms of Q3, it's reflected in the guidance that we're giving today, and we're not breaking out those specific numbers.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney at Citi.\nMark Mahaney: Tom, I want to ask about how you think through balancing margins and growth. I know you don't run the business per [ph] markets for free cash flow, but as you brought the margins down and investing aggressively to support what's this exhilarating 10-year high growth rates, I assume you're doing with a view not to just growth rate one quarter out or two quarters out, but for a full year out. Do you feel that you've got enough to grasp over the business such that when you see that growth rate slowing down, which it inevitably must, whenever that is in the year, that you can easily ramp-up margins? Do you really feel like you're at a point in the business model where that tradeoff is a very easy thing for you to manage?\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. The way you should think about it is first of all, the growth rates that you're seeing in Q2 really stem from investments that we've made over a long period of time. These aren't investments that we've made over the past few quarters. We have invested capacity over the last several quarters to help support that growth. And certainly that's one of the investments that's more recent. But again you should think about it as investments that we've made over a long period of time. For example, we've started investing in our Kindle business and AWS businesses several years ago now. And those have gotten great traction. We launched FBA several years ago. We launched Prime a few years back. We continue to launch new categories. We continue to add unique selections, so those of the things that have happened over an extended period of Time. We are also planting new seeds today. You see that Prime Instant Video as an example of that. Some of the -- a lot of the offerings that we have within AWS are examples of those. And again we have many examples of those across the business. So when we look at -- it was similar to the answer that I gave to Jim in the first question is again think about our business in a number of different pieces, but we have our Retail business that we've been offering in since inception. We continue to add capacity to support those. We continue to add selection and so those are the parts of the business that we feel very, very good about and the fact that we have to deploy more capital in terms of capacity we feel very good about. Again, our historical returns aren't predictive but we feel very good about it. And then we feel very good about the assets we have in our digital space as we convert from physical to digital, and then we talked about some of the newer investments as well that we feel very good that we're investing in today that we certainly hope and plan on getting good returns for shareholders. But our goal ultimately is, as you mentioned not to optimize for margins, but our goal is to maximize free cash flow and have high ROICs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: I just wanted to ask two things. First, Tom it looks like you hired 5,300 people during the quarter. Can you give us some color on how they are spread out across the business? And then secondly, as you look at your margin outlook here for 3Q. Can you give us some color on the target roll-off and whether that's contemplated here in the outlook and how much of an impact that is?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the people and the quarter, keep in mind that we did acquire Quidsi at the start of the quarter, so that's included in the number. And so if you take Quidsi plus the operations in CS people that we added for the capacity that we've been talking about. The combination of those two make up the majority of those adds. Now we still had certainly adds across the business in a number of different areas. And particularly in some of the areas I mentioned, in some of the earlier questions. So again, the majority are of those 5,300, as well as actually the year-over-year increase, which is just under 15,000 is due to operations in CS and again, more recently, the acquisition of Quidsi. As for the margin, again, in terms of target, they've announced that they're going to be going to their new website in Q4 and we've had a very good relationship with them over the past several years. And we certainly wish them well with their new website. We were pleased to offer those services for them and again they've announced that they'll be switching to a new website in Q4.\nOperator: We'll go next to Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company.\nYoussef Squali: Two quick questions please. First on the -- can you provide us an update on the distributed build out? How many distribution centers you have or you had by year-end -- I'm sorry, by quarter end. How many do you think you're going to have by year-end? I'm trying to figure out, where your capacity utilization today versus, say, 6 months ago. And second, can you talk about the strategy behind maybe the planned launch of the tablet products? Would you be able to looking to leverage in-store distribution channels for that product similar to what you've done with Kindle?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of fulfillment centers. Last quarter, when we had our call, we had mentioned, or I had mentioned, that we had announced 9 fulfillment centers globally at that point. Right now, we've announced 15, and we are actually planning on a few more than that between now and the end of the year. So again if you look at where we're hiring for, we've announced, it's 15 today. And you should expect a few more. That compares to -- we added 13 last year. So it will be more than 15. 13 last year, it will be more than 15 this year...\nYoussef Squali: And that's for a total of how many?\nThomas Szkutak: We haven't given the total for the year, but it's approximately in the low 50s adding 15 on top of that and then expect a few more. In terms of your other question, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we might or might not do. And so I can't help you with that question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.\nScott Devitt: Tom, net shipping costs were up 110 basis points year-over-year. I just wondered if you could talk about the impacts on that from oil prices versus Amazon Prime adoption and other customer experience initiatives that you've been working on.\nThomas Szkutak: If you look at really our net shipping costs over the last several quarters, what you've seen is we've been shipping and certainly more free and that includes Amazon Prime. We've also certainly incurred some higher shipping costs as you mentioned with fuel prices, but that's something that we've been doing with, really, since we started offering free shipping back in the early 2000s. So that's something that we're used to dealing with and something that we have dealt with. So again what you're seeing again over the last several quarters is certainly the customers like our free shipping programs, including some [ph] prime and that's reflected and that number. That's also one of the inputs along with a lot of the other things that we've been talking about that's helping fuel our growth.\nOperator: We'll go next to Colin Sebastian with R W. Baird.\nColin Sebastian: I guess first off going back, Tom, to what you mentioned earlier in the call and the drivers of accelerating growth. I wonder if you could talk about the relative importance of these factors, in particular the low prices. And then secondly, just curious in the progress you're making in growing the China business. I think you've added more fulfillment capacity there, e-commerce in general appears to be accelerating in that market. If you could talk about your position and the relative importance of that.\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. In terms of lower prices, it's kind of hard to describe, to answer your question actually. We view it as an extremely important aspect of our business. It's -- there's a number of different things that are important to customers and certainly are making sure that we have great prices for our customers and great values for customers is extremely important. It's something that we've been working on for a number of years, making sure that we know when we have great prices relative to others. And so that's something that we've continued to work on to make it a great experience for customers and we do that globally across all of our categories. In terms of your question on China. We're very pleased with our business in China. It's growing very fast. It's -- we are in investment mode in that country and -- but we think it's a very interesting long-term opportunity and the team's doing a very nice job there and we continue to invest, and we're seeing nice growth there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with UBS.\nBrian Pitz: Tom, maybe you could give us an update on affiliates and the sales tax issue that's going on. Any updates there? As you cut ties with affiliates and [indiscernible] collect sales taxes, how should we be thinking about the impact on both revenue and margin?\nThomas Szkutak: I think in terms of the sales tax issue in total, the way you should think about it is we support a federal simplified approach as we have more than 10 years. We think in the U.S., that the federal solution's a great way to solve this. Also keep in mind as you think about our global business, we already collect sales tax or equivalent to more than half of our business or approximately half of our business across the world, and again we think the right solution to the U.S. is the federal solution. In terms of beyond that, we continue to serve our customers globally and we continue to work through the issue that you described.\nBrian Pitz: Should we think about any additional reductions in the number of affiliates going forward or are we at a stable point right now?\nThomas Szkutak: I really can't comment on that. We're incredibly pleased to have our affiliates. We continue to work with them and there's not much more I can add to that.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.\nJeetil Patel: Two questions. In general digital content is becoming a growing industry theme as well as it seems like for Amazon. I guess curious as to whether you can comment on if there's a higher propensity for Prime customers to adopt digital content or is it broad-based among the customer base as a whole. And then second, a lot of the investments you're pushing through today, in terms of facilities, OpEx, et cetera. Can you talk about maybe what year are they typically geared for? How far out do you typically plan for in terms of investments today on products, new or existing? How far out do you typically think about from a planning standpoint that you're already absorbing in the model today?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of digital content, it's -- we certainly have an offering right now. You asked the relationship between that and Prime. We certainly have a product with Prime is in video [ph] that we like. It's extremely early. We're learning, customers love it. What they're seeing so far we like what we're seeing so far in terms of some of the metrics but again it's very, very early. We do think that we are fortunate that we can offer such a service to customers, along with free shipping. We think that our good customers like both. They're both physical and digital customers. And so I'm not sure there's much more I can add to that. And then I'm sorry the second part of your question?\nJeetil Patel: Yes just a lot of the expense build and investments that you're making today in the form of OpEx and CapEx. I guess, how far out do you typically think through some of these plans, in terms of today and what you're assuming in the model on kind of -- on these last couple of quarters relative to when you start to see kind of the fruits of the labor, some of the product start to commercialize in the marketplace?\nThomas Szkutak: Well we look at our overall investments, certainly not on a long-term basis, we have -- when we launch or invest in something new, it's usually a number of years before we're cash flow positive. And then in many cases, several years before cash flow positive. And so we do take a long-term view. That being said, we monitor those investments very carefully. So, for example, and we do it on a discrete basis, on an area-by-area basis in terms of our investment. For example, in our Web Services business. That team has done a very nice job of growing that business innovating on behalf of customers and we're also trying to see how do we get -- ensure we get higher ROICs on that business. And so they've been working on that for a number of years. And so they look at it on a service-by-service basis. And what they're trying to do is become not only great -- have great services for customers but to be as efficient as possible in terms of from an investment standpoint. And so those are -- that just happens to be an example. That happens across the business. And we continue to monitor those investments.\nJeetil Patel: Can I ask it a different way? But the unit growth you're seeing this year of 50-plus percent. When do you think you put in kind of the investments or the plans in the P&L? Would you say it was back in 2008 or 2007, or would you say it was more recent than that?\nThomas Szkutak: Yes, yes, and yes. In terms of what enabled us to have the growth rate that we're experiencing today, I'll just take the retail part of our business for a second. There are many, many aspects of it, let me take just the retail part of it. We've continued to add great selection over a long period of time. And when I say great selection, unique selection. We've continued to get sharper and sharper arm pricing, understanding exactly where we are from a pricing standpoint. We've continued to launch new programs that get our product to customers quicker. We offered free shipping a number of years ago that made it more economical. We offer Prime to make it kind of quicker and more economical to get to customers, so it's a great service for customers. So all of these things have built upon themselves. We offer third-party offerings of [ph] 36% of total units. Several years ago now or a few years ago now, we'd launched Fulfilled by Amazon. It was a way to make that experience better for customers as well as sellers. So these things have built upon each other over a period of years. Now what you're seeing is there is a concentrated amount of investment that's going in, relative to capacity more recently. That really came out of -- you see different periods of growth that we've had where things have gotten softer, that we will absorb that investment and it becomes more productive. We saw that happen particularly in the U.S. when we had the downturn starting in late 2008. It kind of went through a portion certainly of 2009 even though our global growth was still in the high 20s. And that was a little bit softer in the U.S. for some of those periods. So we were able to add less fixed investment to support the capacity for that part of the business because of the growth. Now what you've seen is coming off of that through 2010, you saw very strong growth. We had 40% growth in 2010. You saw very strong growth in Q1. We had 36% growth on a local currency basis even with some of the softness in Japan. You've seen reacceleration in Q2 growth was 44% including a couple of hundred basis points of acquisition growth sequentially. So again it's, again these are building upon each other and some of the larger investments we've made to support capacity are more recent over the past 18 months now and that's continuing as you see from our Q3 guidance given the growth we're experiencing. So I'm trying to separate a little bit the growth to support the -- sorry, the capacity to support the growth but then we've made many smaller, some not so small investments over the past 10-years plus that have brought us to the growth rates on the customer experience that we have today.\nJeetil Patel: But strategic versus tactical spend?\nThomas Szkutak: Correct. So tactical, some of the investments that's required to support from a capacity standpoint in the infrastructure, as well as FCs this quarter Retail business, for example, I would consider that tactical or running the business-type adjustment. And those have been sizable. You can see step change in our capital and part of it's for that growth for that reason, part of it's for growth in FBA and part of it's for growth in Web services as well as a few other areas.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nCharles Munster: Back to the tax question. It's inevitable that 100% of your business will be taxed. And let's fast-forward to that point. What message would you have for investors on how to think about the impact that will have on your business? And then a follow-up to that is there are some rumors that as you pull the affiliates out of California, you may actually have some sort of sales tax liability. Can you put any of those rumors to rest?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of where we'll end up I'm certainly not going to speculate where we'll end up over a period of time, in terms of sales tax. And again, I'm talking the broader issue, not any particular state. The way I think about it I talked about our approach in terms of the U.S. of having a federal our national solution and I think that's the right approach. But in terms of the business itself, one thing to keep in mind is that we do collect, as a reminder, sales tax or equivalent tax at approximately half of our business today. And so when you look at the growth rates that we're experiencing, again half or a little over half of our business we're collecting that today. So that part of the base that we have -- in the end, customers really want is they want a great experience, they want -- certainly they want low prices. They want the selection that they're looking for. They want fast delivery. They want it to be as convenient as possible. That's true among certainly our retail customers. So we continue to work on that experience. We continue to work on trying to make the seller experience even better, FBA, Fulfillment by Amazon is another example of that. That happens to also have a customer benefit the consumer not just the seller, but again sellers like it as well as consumers. We continue to make sure that our experience is good for our Web Services business. So we take that, the customers experience extremely seriously, it's something they\u2019re working on very, very hard. And our digital offerings, Kindle, we have a great team who's innovating on behalf of customers across the business including our Kindle business. And so they're trying to make sure they continue to innovate. And so all of these things that I had mentioned are things that we think are important to customers and ultimately why customers will purchase from us or not. Those are the things that we're going to continue to work on because we can't predict what will happen in some of these other things. But we can predict that customers will still want low prices, they'll still want great selection, they'll still want convenience, they'll still want innovative products and services, on every half. So those are the things that we're going to be continuing to work on and have worked on since our inception.\nCharles Munster: And then the affiliates is there any sales tax? Are you guys liable for any past sales tax in California?\nThomas Szkutak: I can't -- I'm not to comment on that.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Two things. Talk about a lot of things, but not AWS. You still think that business -- I guess how's the trajectory? Do you still it still can be as big as retail? And any thoughts on what the margin profile of that business looks like relative to your core? So just thoughts on AWS in general. And then secondly, did you change the historical third-party unit forecast? I had a couple question on that. It looks like some of the historicals might have been higher than what you might have said in a couple prior quarters?\nThomas Szkutak: I'll answer the second one first. In terms of the unit growth and the third-party units, what we did this quarter, which is different than we have previously, we actually went with the paid unit growth as opposed to total units. So historically, we've been including -- there's been some amount of free units included in those numbers. And so for example, if you take a look at our current quarter, the number I mentioned was paid unit growth of 56%. That compared to again that's paid unit growth, that compared to 45% paid unit growth in Q1. The number that we reported in Q1 was actually 51% because that included free. So the comparable -- the 45% for Q1 and the 56% for Q2 are comparable. Again, those are just paid units. And then the third-party percentage of total units was 36% this quarter, up from 34% last year. And again those are paid units for the percentage of total units. And so we thought it would be an interesting, another interesting way of looking at it so we thought we'd provide it this quarter. In terms of the AWS business, it's certainly a very, very big space. Hard to say how big it will be for Amazon, but we're incredibly excited about that business. The team's done a terrific job and continue to innovate on behalf of customers. And we have just a great team of innovators and operators running that business, and we're very excited about it.\nJustin Post: Can you say whether it's in investment mode or is it contributing at all to the bottom line at this point?\nThomas Szkutak: You should expect that we continue to invest in that business because of the high-growth nature of it. It's growing very fast. It is one of the reasons why you're seeing certainly a big contributor to our CapEx. It's also reflected in the tech and content line. And so again we're very excited about what we're seeing there. And the team is going to continue to stay heads down focused on their customer to drive that business.\nJohn Felton: Great. Well thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2011, "date": "2011-04-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: . Good day, and welcome to the Amazon Quarterly Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Felton, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Felton: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today are Tom Szkutak, our CFO; and Rob Eldridge, our VP of Investor Relations. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2011, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Szkutak: Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 9% to $3.03 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow decreased 18% to $1.9 billion. Return on invested capital of 24%, down from 45%. ROIC [return on invested capital] as TTM [trailing 12 months] free cash flow is divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 466 million shares compared with 463 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 38% to $9.86 billion or 36%, excluding the $144 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who also continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $3.96 billion, up 15% or 13%, excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM [Electronics and other General Merchandise] revenue increased to $5.59 billion, up 59% or 57% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 49%. Worldwide unit growth was 51%. Active customer accounts exceeded 137 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 33% of total units. Now, I'll discuss the operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. The cost of sales was $7.61 billion or 77.2% of revenue compared with 77.1%. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $1.78 billion or 18.1% of sales, up 234 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $831 million or 8.4% of revenue compared with 7.4%. Tech and Content was $580 million or 5.3% of revenue compared with 4.5%. Marketing was $320 million or 3.2% of revenue compared with 2.7%. Now, I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $5.47 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.89 billion. EGM revenue grew 63% to $3.3 billion, representing 60% of North America revenues, up from 54%. North America segment operating income increased 6% to $290 million, a 5.3% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $4.39 billion. Adjusting for the $141 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 27%. We estimate that the international revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points following the earthquake and subsequent events in Japan. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.07 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.29 billion or 49% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 52% of international revenues, up from 44%. International segment operating income decreased 25% to $175 million, a 4.0% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 28%. CSOI [consolidated operating income] decreased 8% to $465 million or 4.7% of revenue, down 239 basis points year-to-year. Excluding the $7 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 9%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 18% to $322 million or 3.3% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $89 million in Q1 or a 29% rate for the quarter. The tax provision for Q1 2011 includes income tax expense for approximately $8 million related to a discrete item in the quarter. GAAP net income was $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared with $299 million and $0.66 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.82 billion year-over-year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 59% to $2.89 billion and inventory turns were 11.6, down from 12.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 53% to $5.54 billion and accounts payable days increased to 66 from 59 in the prior year. Our Q1 2011 capital expenditures were $298 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q2 2011, we expect net sales between $8.85 billion and $9.65 billion or growth between 35% and 47%. This guidance anticipates approximately 640 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $95 million and $245 million or between 65% decline and 9% decline. This includes approximately $180 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $275 million and $425 million or between a 32% decline and 5% growth. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. With that, John, let's move to questions.\nJohn Felton: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Spencer Wang with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: Thanks for taking the question. 2 quick questions for Tom. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on your 2Q guidance and what you're thinking the impact from Japan could be and how you're thinking about when you incorporate that into your guidance? And then secondly, on shipping, the losses seem like they're growing. So I was wondering if you could just talk, Tom, about is that a function of more Prime usage, faster shipping or fuel cost perhaps impacting that line? Any more detail there would be great. Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. In terms of your first question, what we saw for Japan, first of all to talk just briefly about Q1 and then I'll talk about Q2. Q1 in terms of impact, we think the impact is approximately 500 basis points on international revenue. If you take a look at international revenue growth, excluding foreign exchange, was up 27%. So about for the unfortunate events in Japan, it would have been approximately 32%. The impact on Q1 in terms of consolidated segment operating income was approximately $20 million. What we saw post the events, we certainly saw a pretty sizable slowdown for the few weeks ending the quarter. What we've seen since then so far quarter-to-date has been that certainly our growth rates have picked up, but they're not at the rates they were previous to the events. So again, we're seeing a positive growth there but not the growth rates we were seeing prior to that. And so what we believe for the quarter, along with all of our other assumptions are included in the guidance that we've given today. In terms of your second question related to shipping profit, what you're really seeing there is customers are coming out in great numbers with all of our adopting all of our free shipping programs including Amazon Prime. I think we're seeing great adoption there and that's really what's driving those numbers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: Great, thanks. A couple of questions. One, I guess, when you look at your -- it looks like the International business is really starting to kick in nicely and it seems like Amazon Prime has now had a chance to really mature and ramp up in a lot of your regions. I'm curious, are you seeing the same type of kind of returns that you saw in the U.S. market in terms of customer adoption, kind of purchase frequency in the international markets around Prime? And second, it seems like Kindle, you're kind of employing a similar strategies that you did with Prime which is stagger versus the U.S. market, and is it almost following the same path of kind of ramp and returns for the Kindle initiatives globally as you saw in the U.S. market?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of your first question, Jeetil, related to Prime, we are seeing these similar dynamics. We are seeing customers love Prime in all geographies that we've offered it in. We are seeing great cross shopping that's happening, so customers really like the program. And obviously we have different offers depending upon geography, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far. In terms of Kindle, we've seen tremendous growth both from a device standpoint, as well as a unit standpoint in terms of digital books in the U.S. And where we are now offering it outside of the U.S., we're seeing the same -- even though it's early, we're seeing great adoption and growth there. So we're very, very happy to see the progress that we've made. One thing that we're doing obviously, you probably saw the launch related to -- the announcement related to Kindle special offers, we actually will start shipping tomorrow. The teams did a nice job of moving the dates up from several days from now to start shipping tomorrow, so very pleased to be able to offer that and excited about that offering.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.\nMark Mahaney: Great, thanks. 2 quick questions. That 51% unit growth seems like a real outlier. You haven't had that kind of unit growth in the past. Is there something in there that's unusual, something in there that's one time-ish, something in there that tells -- would have you warn people to think that that's not a sustainable growth level? And then very recently, you have something of an outage in the Amazon Web Services field. Was that a demand problem which is not necessarily a bad thing or are there certain efficiencies that you needed to -- or inefficiencies that you needed to address that have been fixed? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Probably the best way to answer the unit growth rate is if you take a look at what we saw in Q4 which is 43% growth rate, we saw a nice acceleration from 43% to 51% in Q1. What you're seeing there is we saw a great growth across the business. But the biggest thing you're seeing is that -- which primarily the consequence of growth of our digital business. That's what you're seeing in the growth rate, the acceleration in growth rate from Q4 to Q1. In terms of AWS, again, the team is working very deliberately on the way to identify and validate and fix the root causes associated with this incident, and that's what they're working on and I don't really have a lot to add to that at this time.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Youssef Squali with Jefferies.\nYoussef Squali: Thank you very much. 2 quick questions. First, the midpoint of guidance for Q2 implies margins about 1.8%. So x SBC, where's the other 150 bps or so of additional spend going? How much of that is on recurring things like the 4,200 people or so you hired in the quarter versus kind of any one-time items? And second on the state tax issue, how big a concern is it to you, how big an advantage do you believe you've enjoyed so far from not paying taxes in those states? I guess in other words, would you have been able to grow at the rates you have been growing at if taxes were kind of levied across -- on your business across the U.S.?\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. In terms of your first question, we're not breaking out the individual line items, if you will, for operating expenses. But if you take a look at what we saw in Q1, you're seeing that we've added a lot of capacity to our CapEx and you'll also see the fulfillment capacities here on our CapEx and you'll also see it in the fulfillment line item. We added 13 fulfillment centers last year. If you take a look at the announcements that we've had to date, we're adding 9 fulfillment centers this year. Those are the ones that we've announced. With the growth rates we're seeing, you should expect -- if the order continues, you should expect to see more than that this year as well, more than the 9. So that's what you're seeing in the Q1. And you'll also see that reflected in the Q2 guidance as well. Same is true with Tech and Contents. We're adding a lot of capacity to support our growing business. Again, you've seen that reflected in the CapEx as well as the Q1 Tech and Content line and that's also reflected in the guidance as well. In terms of state taxes, one thing you keep in mind is we actually collect sales and value-added tax in approximately 50% of our revenue base, sort of a little over 50% of our revenue base today. And so the growth rates that you're seeing reflect the fact that we are collecting in more than half of our revenue base. So beyond that, there's not a lot I can add there.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions. If I look at the 74% growth in North America and other revenues, is that primarily due to Amazon Web Services? And then similarly, if I look at the step up in CapEx, would that also be primarily due to Amazon Web Services? And then kind of uniting the 2 questions together, historically Amazon has been very capital disciplined, how do you get confident that the capital you're putting into Amazon Web Services would generate returns over the time that you desire?\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. If you look at North America, other growth in the North America includes a number of items, including Web services. So it's a combination of all those items that we've talked about in the past. And so but certainly, Web services is a meaningful part of that. In terms of the CapEx question, what you see in CapEx is -- if you look at the growth, we had $1.1 billion of CapEx in the last 12 months. And if you look at the growth year-over-year of that CapEx, approximately 80% of that is due to pure capacity. And that's capacity in terms of fulfillment, that's capacity from an infrastructure standpoint to serve the retail business as well as AWS. And another 10% to 12% is associated with just the corporate office space and the remainder is a number of small items. So again, the vast majority, approximately 80%, is due to capacity, both infrastructure and our operation capacity. In terms of your question about how we think about AWS, we, like a lot of parts of our business, we look at that business very discretely and all the services very discretely. And we look at the ROIC potential of those businesses and the opportunity to work on trying to figure out the best way we get great returns for shareholders. And that's something that we've been doing since we launched the business, and obviously we have a lot more information to do that now than we did at launch. But again, it's something that we do continuously.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company.\nJames Friedland: Thanks. One of the other line items that was up year-over-year was marketing expense, 50 basis points. Is that a ramp or an incremental ramp in Kindle promotion? You guys also did something with a LivingSocial promotion in Q1. And also equity and affiliates was up a little bit. Was that due to the LivingSocial investments? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of marketing, the 2 primary paid marketing are still our associates channel and sponsored search. And so those are our 2 primary, but you're correct in terms of we are doing, as you've probably seen, some more broadscale advertising related to Kindle would be certainly incremental year-over-year and certainly impacting that number. In terms of the equity line, we do have a number of equity investments. And certainly, one of those is LivingSocial. And it's certainly impacting that number that you're seeing.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.\nBenjamin Schachter: Can you describe how Amazon views its advertising business? In particular, how ramping up capabilities there could impact both Amazon properties and devices? And then separately, how you could participate in advertising opportunities on third-party sites? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Yes, in terms of our advertising business, it's still very early. The team has done a fantastic job growing that business, and we'll have to wait and see what we do further with that business, but it's something that the team has done a great job. And it allows us and we think it allows us over time to have another way to have great low prices for customers.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Colin Sebastian with Lazard Capital Markets.\nColin Sebastian: [Audio Gap] capacity build out. So when you mentioned that these top line growth rates that you may consider increasing the capital commitment to new capacity, is that something that's already reflected in the Q2 guidance range, or is that more likely a decision for the second half of the year? And then on the international operating income being down 25%, given that majority of Tech and Content spending is incurred in North America, if you could just clarify the drivers of that decline in income? Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: You just -- I'm sorry, Colin, you're just breaking up in the first part of your question around capacity?\nColin Sebastian: Sure. So you mentioned the top line growth, if these rates continue, you might consider increasing the capital commitment to new capacity. And so I guess the question is, is that already somewhat reflected in your Q2 guidance or would that be a second half decision in terms of ramping up beyond the 9 fulfillment centers?\nThomas Szkutak: Here's where we are. We've had announcements of 9 fulfillment centers. 1 is operational today, 1 is coming up, will be operational in the coming days. We're actually doing receiving now. And then the remainder of those fulfillment centers will be throughout the year. And my comment was those are the ones that we've announced that certainly with the high growth that we're experiencing, you should expect that, should that continue, we would be adding additional fulfillment centers beyond it. What you are seeing in the Q2 guidance certainly reflects the fact that we will be adding capacity. And that's certainly 1 of the factors that went into the guidance that we've given.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.\nScott Devitt: Thanks, just 1 question please. In categories that are facing structural change in distribution like the book industry which continues to be your largest segment, I was just wondering if you could talk about the effects that that is having today or may have on the margin profile of that business for you over time? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Well, as we look at these new businesses, we're certainly looking at it from a free cash flow and a return on investment standpoint from a long term -- with a long-term perspective. We're incredibly excited in that specific one that you mentioned with Kindle because we see that customers are buying a lot more books. And so we're incredibly excited to be able to offer that to customers. We think the potential long term is -- we love the potential that it has long term and we continue to invest in that business.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS.\nBrian Pitz: Thanks. A couple of quick ones. For Q2 revenue guidance, would you comment on whether Quidsi and Lovefilm are included? If so, any approximation of the impact? And then on content, can you give us any indications on the level of spending to secure digital content rights? Do you anticipate for Prime instant video? And then any commentary on whether or not that's driving Prime usage? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of Quidsi and Lovefilm, yes they're both in Q2. The impact is on revenue, approximately $140 million of revenue in Q2 which works out to be about 220 basis points of growth. Consolidated segment operating income is actually negative, approximately $15 million, and GAAP operating income is approximately negative $30 million in the quarter. So that's what's included in the Q2 guidance for Quidsi and Lovefilm combined. In terms of content, you have to stay tuned on that. We're not putting out those details. But the only thing I would say about it is we're very, very pleased with the adoption so far and it's very early and we will be adding some more content over time.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sandeep Aggarwal with Caris & Company.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Thanks for taking my question. I have 2 questions. One is, Tom, fulfillment and shipping expense have been among the core of Singles Amazon. And many multi-general dealers and pure-play commerce companies are getting into that space or getting better at least including eBay's possible acquisition of GSI Commerce. So how does Amazon continue to spend on its competitive modes around fulfillment and shipping experience? And second question is can you make a comment about the capacity utilization of the 13 fulfillment centers you set up last year?\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the first part, we have a fantastic operations team that is continuing to look at ways to improve delivery speed, as well as improving our cost structure over time. And that's something you'd see if you look back over our history, it's something that they've worked on. And so they're always looking at ways to better serve customers and to get better. And so there's a number of ways that they do that. And it's a constant focus. In terms of the capacity, I don't think there's anything, any way to really help you because, again, the utilization will vary from week-to-week and quarter-to-quarter. But what we are seeing is, as you would expect with this great growth that we're experiencing, there is just more demand for capacity and that's both from a fulfillment capacity, that's both from our core retail business as well as fulfilled by Amazon.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.\nKenneth Sena: Thanks. So for the days payable to vendors, the increase was 11% to 66 days. How much more improvement do you think that you have there or is there something also driving that improvement that you can share? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: We're not giving -- we have been able to get good improvements over the past several years in AP days. We're not giving guidance on what that could look like, but we continue to work with our partners to improve our working capital cycle. And obviously, there's certainly a mix of categories that we have. They all have their own operating cycle. But again, we're very pleased with the operating cycle that we have and we'll continue to work with our partners over time.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Can you just go into a little bit more detail on the DC centers? So of the 9 centers that you've announced, how many are international? And then are the costs higher to launch an international DC internationally than in the U.S.? So just a little more color on that. Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. The -- of the 9, and we could probably have either Rob or John get back to you on the exact details, but approximately 4 those are in the U.S. or 5 in North America and the others are in international. So the fulfillment centers vary depending upon the level of automation and the locations they're in. I can't really give you a precise as 1 geography higher than another. It kind of depends on size and the level of automation.\nRobert Eldridge: Hey Jason, it's Rob. I think 1 thing to add here is Tom's point. We're expanding fulfillment capacity worldwide. It's not just in a specific geography because the growth we're seeing is broad-based. The second point I just want to make is as we are building system of scales, fulfillment becomes more of a continuous investment project. It becomes less project to our end, just something that we need to undertake on a go-forward basis. And so you're certainly seeing that decision being reflected in our Q1 results and it's also reflected in our Q2 guidance.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nCharles Munster: And I realized you guys talked about the impact of the LivingSocial promo, and as we look at the uptick in marketing expenses, it seems that you're spending a little bit more to get each incremental new customer. Is that true? And if so, what will be driving that?\nThomas Szkutak: Sorry, I didn't catch the first part of it, the LivingSocial piece.\nCharles Munster: Well, I know you mentioned the LivingSocial, the impact of the LivingSocial promo on the marketing expenses. But backing that out, as you look at your marketing expenses, can you just talk a little bit about customer acquisition cost and how they've been trending?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of -- I didn't mention anything about LivingSocial as it related to our marketing expense line. What I was referring to is if you look at our equity income line on our income statement, you can see an expense there and I've said that there was -- that was made up of a number of different investments that we have which includes LivingSocial, so that was the LivingSocial piece. In terms of marketing spend, we still -- the spend is very efficient. And again, what I mentioned earlier was that still the 2 primary pieces of our spend are our associates channel and also sponsored search, so those are our 2 primary. In terms of looking at it year-over-year, you're also seeing some of the broadscale spending we're doing specifically related to Kindle that's impacting that number as well.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Heath Terry with Canaccord.\nHeath Terry: Great, thank you. Seeing growth rates accelerate even slightly for the first time in the past 4 quarters, to what extent would you attribute that to the infrastructure buildout, improving product selection and availability? And maybe to get a little more granular, can you quantify for us the improvement in your product delivery time or availability that you've seen since the beginning of investment cycle?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of quantifying, I'm not sure how much I can help you with that but there's no question that what we're seeing is customers responding to the increased selection across many categories, across many geographies. We also, certainly Prime is having an impact, as well as our other free shipping offers and so the adoption of both has been great. And so we're very pleased to that. Also, making sure that we have great low prices for customers is also having impact. So all of those things are having an impact on our growth rate that you see there.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Weinstein with Pacific Crest.\nSteve Weinstein: Great, thank you for taking my question. So it's already been noticed that the growth in units relative to growth in revenues is a pretty substantial difference and kind of a widening difference. I was wondering if you could explain when a customer becomes a digital customer and they started buying whether Kindle books or another digital product, how does their spending on Amazon change? Are they spending similar amounts with you and just buying more units or is the actual amount of spending with Amazon going up? Obviously the unit growth is a lot. Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: I apologize, Steve, but there's not a lot I'll be able to help you with there in terms of specific numbers. But we are seeing customers who are digital customers still being very good, physical customers as well, so buying, doing a lot of cross shopping across our business. And so we're very excited about our digital offerings and it's certainly reflected in the unit growth that you mentioned. But also we're seeing very good growth amongst many physical categories across all of our geographies as well. So again, customers are responding to some of the things I already mentioned but they're certainly responding to the selection that we have for our digital offerings, as well as our physical product offerings. And that's reflected in the growth rates.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for 1 final question tonight. It does come from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMatt Nemer: Thanks for taking my question, 2 questions actually. One, is there a point where increased digital offerings sales offset investments in selection and in stocks and we start to see that in the inventory turns number? And then secondly, a question on fulfillment and tax issues. How flexible is your fulfillment capacity in the U.S. if a state changes its mind or renegs on a prior agreement regarding tax collection? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of your first question, the reason why we're adding the physical capacity is it's growing very fast. So we are having the benefit of seeing both a very strong growth in our digital offerings, as well as a very strong growth in our physical offerings. So it's the combination of both things that are driving the overall growth of our business, as well as the fulfillment centers that you're seeing in the case of your question. In terms of the fulfillment centers, we have a lot of -- we have a wide range of fulfillment centers across a number of different states and geographies, and we continue -- our operation team does a great job in terms of figuring out where the best places are to invest and they'll continue to do that over time.\nJohn Felton: Great. Thank you very much for your questions. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least till the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation."}], "2013": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2012, "date": "2013-01-30 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2012 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.\nSean Boyle: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 29, 2013 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Szkutak: Thanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 7% to $4.81 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 81% to $395 million. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $3.79 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in the fourth quarter. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investing in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital was 4%, down from 22%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 470 million shares compared with 460 million shares one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $21.27 billion or 23% excluding the $178 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $6.51 billion, up 8% or 10% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.93 billion, up 28% or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales, up from 63%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded 200 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units. Now, I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.14 billion, or 75.9% of revenue, compared with 79.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content in G&A combined was $4.45 billion, or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 293 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.2 billion, or 10.3% of revenue compared with 9.3%. Tech and content was $1.22 billion, or 5.7% of revenue, compared with 4.5%. Marketing was $833 million, or 3.9% of revenue compared with 3.3%. Now, I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 23% to $12.17 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.9 billion. EGM revenue grew 24% to $8.5 billion, representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 69%. North America segment operating income increased 114% to $608 million, a 5% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 21% to $9.09 billion. Adjusting for the hundred $83 million year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, revenue growth was 23%. Media revenue grew 5% to $3.61 billion, or 7% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 35% to $5.43 billion, or 37% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 60% of international revenues, up from 54%. International segment operating income decreased 61% to $70 million a, 0.8% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 56%. CSOI increased 47% to $678 million, or 3.2% of revenue, up approximately 54 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating. GAAP operating income increased 56% to $405 million, or 1.9% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $194 million in Q4, resulting in a 58% rate for the quarter and 79% rate for the full year 2012. GAAP net income was $97 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared with $177 million and $0.38 per diluted share. Now, I will discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 27% to $61.0 9 billion. North America revenue grew 30% $34.81 billion and International revenue grew 23% to $26.28 billion, or 27% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI increased 6% to $1.67 billion, or 7% excluding the unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin decreased 54 basis points, 2.7%. GAAP operating income decreased 22% to $676 million, or 1.1% of net sales. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.87 billion year-over-year to $11.45 billion. Inventory increased 21% to $6.03 billion and inventory turns were 9.3, down from 10.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 20% to $13.32 billion and accounts payable days increased to 76 from 74 in the prior year. In Q4 2012, we usually $3 billion of senior non-convertible unsecured debt in three, five and seven-year tranches with proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material impact on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q1 2013, we expect net sales of between $15 billion and $16.6 billion or growth between 14% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 122 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between the $285 million loss and $65 million positive income compared to $192 million income in the prior period year. This includes approximately $285 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other expense to be between zero and $350 million compared to $390 million income in the prior period. We remain head sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks for that. Sean, let's go to questions\nSean Boyle: Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.\nScott Devitt: Tom, it looks that you have successfully begin the transition of your logistics costs in the direction of being more of a fixed fulfillment cost with lower unit based shipping costs, given that the growth rate of about shipping now meaningfully below the fulfillment growth rate. So the question is, is this something that we should expect to continue now in the back of this meaningful fulfillment center expansion ramp? Then separately, but on the same topic, we are also wondering, are there other parts of the business in which you can make this transition to more of a fixed cost in the future? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the fulfillment question, you are right in terms of over the past few years, we have expanded in our fulfillment network pretty extensively to the point where we are closer to customers and you are seeing that reflected in our transportation cost, you can obviously see the fulfillment expense is certainly not fixed in terms of absolute terms but you can see that we had 20 fulfillment centers last year and that\u2019s reflected in the operating expense that you are seeing. But that is a benefit of having adding to our fulfillment center network. We get closer and closer to customers with a lot of great selection. So you are seeing that reflected in the individual of business gross margins, which shows up as benefits of transportation cost. In terms of other opportunities, certainly there are a number of opportunities as we invest in individual customer experience areas across the business. Many of those would be on our website. We have a relatively fixed expense as we launch those and we amortize those costs over our full customer base. So as they grow to become more effective on a per unit or per customer basis. So there is a number of opportunities that we have had and will have going forward to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: Great, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the shift to third-party, I guess in particularly, I think last 4Q you talked about shifting more the business in the videogame space, in particular the third-party categories that you would specifically point to in this last 4Q, you already made sort of a similar shift. Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: We did see, you know, a good expansion as you mentioned in 3P, a third-party units as a percentage of total units increased from 36% last year Q4 to 39% on expansion of approximately 300 basis points. Our overall unit growth rate for the quarter in total was 32%. Our third-party growth rate was in excess of 40%, so, again, nice growth. You are certainly seeing it in a number of areas. You see it certainly in our EGM business look. If you look at our North America growth rates are unique and see that our revenues, up 23% but our third-party, our total unit growth rate was a substantially faster than that, and our third-party units were growing very fast there as well, so there's a number of differently that you are seeing that, but certainly you are seeing it there.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question Brian Pitz with Jefferies.\nBrian Pitz: Great. Thanks. Looks like you are moving more in the direction of same-day shipping. Would you provide any thoughts or insights here? Should we anticipate a significant ramp-up of fulfillment center build out, particularly in Q2, Q3? And, maybe, if you could just comment more generally on your FC built out plans U.S. versus international? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: There is not a lot I can comment on in terms of our plans similar to last year no as we progress through the year, we can give you further updates on what we plan to do there. Last year, we opened up 20 new fulfillment centers, and so we saw in a very rapid growth in fulfillment capacity last year, and stay tuned and we'll let you know more as the year progress there.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. Two questions please. The paid unit growth deceleration to 32% there seems a bit of a disconnect versus an active customer growth that didn't decelerated as much on a per customer basis, are you seeing some sort of change in overall activity. Is that the impact of newer international markets? Then just on the investment cycle, the last couple of calls, you've consistently called out future investments whether the $1.4 billion for Seattle or distribution center expansion. You didn't do it this quarter I don't over read into it, but does that we are at the end of a major investment cycle? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of unit growth, there's not a lot more I can add to it. We did see very strong, we saw substantially unit growth and revenue growth in terms of the paid unit growth in Q4 unit, which we are seeing very strong third-party growth as well, was up over 40%. In terms of investment cycle, I wouldn't read into anything related to that. We will still be adding capacity during 2013 in terms of the levels of how much we'll add. As I mentioned earlier in the call, just stay tuned and we will let you know as the year progresses.\nOperator: We'll go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. I was wondering if you give us just a bit of a sense of what you are seeing as you the rollout fulfillment centers into new state. Obviously the sales tax issue has been that's come up a good bit, but you touched on the impact of being closer with faster delivery in those same state. Net-net, what do you see as being the impact on not asking you to give us kind of a state by state breakdown, but the impact of rolling out the fulfillment center footprint taking both of those things into accounts.\nThomas Szkutak: I am not really sure how best to answer your question. I mean, we certainly have expanded pretty dramatically over the past really coming out of 2009 between 2010, 2011 and 2012. We've rapidly increase our footprint globally. Your comment was more directed towards the U.S., but we have also rapidly increased our footprint in the U.S. As a result of that, your book category selection, a much broader selection closer to customers as you would expect with this rapid increase. We have also expanded selection during that time period. So we continue to be in the locations we would like to be in and we will continue to expand our footprint over time and become even closer and closer to customers. Beyond that there is not a lot I can add.\nOperator: We will go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster: Good afternoon. Some high level query minus the margin difference between 1P and 3P. I know in the past you talked about you being agnostic between the two but the growth in 3P and what your CSOI margins imply that 3P has little bit higher margin. Is that the correct read through? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: There is some variation by business but certainly that we attempt to do as from my pricing standpoint, is to try to be agnostic. That is really how we run the business. Again, this is on a third-party versus retail. Then, we have also added certainly a lot of other services over the past year in terms of fulfillment. So it really depends upon where we are in the investment cycle, what our utilization is. As you know, certainly as you look at the last few years, we have been in very heavily expanding in terms of fulfillment capacity because of the growth that we have been experiencing that certainly would put pressure on our overall cost structure. Certainly as a per unit basis because we are not giving the productivity. We don\u2019t get the full productivity for a number of years after expanding. So depending on what type of customer is, you know, whether it is a retail unit, a straight third-party units or NFPA unit but again we are certainly attempting this on a product basis to be roughly agnostic.\nOperator: We will go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks, guys. First, on the device strategy with Kindle and Kindle HD, can you help us at all what you are seeing with the attach rate trend on digital goods after people buy the Kindles. Then generally, do you see a higher overall GMV per customer on Kindle devices than users on Amazon Apps through other devices?\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of attach rates, we haven\u2019t given a lot of detail but I think one thing certainly to look at, and it doesn\u2019t give any attach rate, but it gives you at least a sense of the health of the business, the number that was in the release today. We sure have a multi-billion-dollar e-book business, growing approximately 70% year-over-year, total year last year. That\u2019s growing at that rate after really just launching the business approximately five years ago. So it\u2019s a pretty good healthy growth rate five years in. We are seeing good, I can't give you specific numbers but we have seen very good progress on a number of our other digital media categories. Video, I talked about a little bit earlier, we are seeing Prime customers. Certainly the percentage of Prime customers who were watching free content through Prime Instant Videos has gone up dramatically year-over-year. We have also increased Prime membership dramatically, year-over-year. They are also purchasing a paid content. Those customers that are using this, they watch free but they are also paying for new content which is great. We have launched a number of new services on the music side. Most recently, our CD with free MP3, which we have on many titles. It's still very early but we certainly like that service and pleased to offer to customers. So I can't give you specific for attach rates but the business is making good progress on the video content side. Again it's still very early.\nOperator: We will go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Sandler: Thanks, guys. Just two quick questions. As you guys build out the Prime membership and the fees available through FBA, you run into this challenge of increase in your unit volume of tail items and at the same time we need to get products to customers in much shorter shipping cycle. So, can you talk about how the new fulfillments helps on that front? Is your reliance on air going down as a percent of total items shipped. Then if I remember correctly, you guys reclassified some FBA revenue in early 2012. Can you just remind how that flows through the shipping revenue line and what could happened as you count that in the beginning of '13. Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Sure. Just in terms of overall selection, as we added to Prime, what I was talking about earlier in terms of having a more expanded footprint is, there's no unit question that's helping us add additional selection more economically to Prime. And so on, that's both in terms of third-party selection as well as our retail selection and so that's something that we know continue to have the benefit of as we get more and more members in Prime and have the bigger, bigger concentration of two-day shipping U.S. for that. So, we did add the shipping portion FBA fees in Q1 of 2012 and we see some benefit year-over-year, but we are still seeing leverage in terms of, you know, ex the FBA fees quite a bit leverage there, so we I do not have a specific number for you there, but yes we are still seeing quite a bit of leverage there, ex the re-class that you are referring to.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. Last year you reported 4Q in the lower half of revenue range and you were able to call out Taiwan and video games category. Any reasons why revenues were kind of in the lower half this quarter? And then if you look at gross profit growth, it clearly has accelerated to 40% growth, but unit growth decelerated to 32%.Can you describe what's driving that kind of accelerating gross profit in the face of lower unit growth, and is it possible maybe you are letting the third parties handle some of the many less profitable categories for Amazon. Could you talk about that all? Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: If you take a look at our growth rate, where we think the growth rate for Q4 was solid. It was up 23% on revenue basis quite a bit higher than on a unit growth basis up 32% year-over-year. In terms of some of the things that we saw and we again we saw solid growth across many different categories and geographies year-over-year. Certainly some things to call out in terms of things that may have been a little bit softer. A few examples would be, we did see some of the higher average selling price items, particularly the items greater than $1,000 a little bit softer, a few of the consumer electronics, you subcategories like TVs, MP3 players digital cameras to some extent were softer. But, again, with the base that we have in Q4, still very solid growth. Another one, certainly we are thrilled to have a Paperwhite in our lineup best e-reader that's out there and we are very pleased with it, but we couldn't keep up with demand. We would have had more sales in Q4 for able to keep up with demand and so the team is working very hard to make sure we have good in-stock going forward on that product, but we certainly could have sold more in Q4.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tom Forte with Telsey Advisory Group.\nTom Forte: Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. I want to ask you on Amazon Instant Video, how you thought about your current offering and your ability to add exclusive content in a cost effective manner through Amazon Studios, and what the relationship is between adding more titles and uses on your hardware such your Amazon Kindle devices? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: We will continue to expand our selection, both in terms of Amazon Instant Video as well Prime Instant Video and we will do that in a number of different ways. We think we have a very interesting selection right now and you should expect that will be spending more on content as it relates to Prime over time. We will continue to add selection on the Instant Video. Beyond that, you have to stay tuned.\nOperator: We will go next to Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.\nKen Sena: Hi, I just had a question on your other segment line. Can you talk a little bit about the non-AWS drivers within that line as you are advertising? As you look out, are there advantages to you in terms of having AWS as far as offering things like buying, serving, analytics through the AWS platform to advertisers? Where are you in that rollout phase now? Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: In terms of the AWS business, the business is growing very fast. We have increased the number of services pretty dramatically over the past several years. The team is doing a fantastic job there. We will continue to innovate on behalf of customers in that space. There is a number of other things that go into that line item. Some are credit card as well as other marketing revenue goes in there. But again, AWS is in that line item.\nOperator: We will go next to Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.\nAnthony Diclemente: Hi, thanks. I wondered if you gave comment on the pace of business throughout the fourth quarter? Did you see a particular deceleration in the month of December? Then second question, on international, I am wondering, are there any call outs in terms of specific countries that may have been weighing on profitability? Countries where there is going to be outsized dollars of investment going on or accelerated investment at the current time. Thank you.\nThomas Szkutak: There are not a lot of specifics. We have long been in the practice of not talking about trends in within the quarter in terms of year-over-year growth or anything like that. Obviously the Q4 is very seasonal. December is, by far, the largest the month followed by November but in terms of individual growth rates, we don\u2019t have a lot of comments there. In terms of international, yes, there certainly are geographies that we are investing in heavily. Certainly China would be one. Some of the European countries including some of the new launches that we are investing in. Those are certainly, you are seeing those represented in those segment results.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Rohit Kulkarni with Citi.\nRohit Kulkarni: Okay, thank you for taking my question. In terms of your recent margin profile, actually comparing U.S. and international, I guess over the past four quarters, the vast majority improvement or rather the less worse margin trends that we have seen have been due to U.S. margins improving while international were declining in the range of 300 to 350 basis points. In Q4, international declined just 160 basis points. So my questions, should we read this as a beginning of a trend that we saw how domestic margins increased over the last four quarters and whether international should follow similar route over the next foreseeable future.\nThomas Szkutak: Yes, there is not a particular call out that I could make on that. The only thing that I would, in terms of the change I am referring to, but in terms of the difference between two, keep in mind that, a couple of factors. One, mix of business is a little bit different. Our AWS businesses is in North America segment. You also have some newer geographies. Or geography that I shouldn\u2019t say are necessarily newer but geographies that we are investing in heavily that have a longer-term horizon for returns, the ones I mentioned earlier. So those are factors as you look at the two different segments.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Benjamin Schachter with Mcquarrie.\nBenjamin Schachter: It looks likes the first-party gross margin is actually up fairly meaningful year-over-year. Wonder if you could talk about that within the context of Amazon Kindle hardware is impacting the gross margin. Then separately just any view on how videogames sales impact to the year-over-year growth rate for the quarter? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: Yes. It causes we haven't broken out the first-party versus third-party units since it's something we have done for that's only I am today or we have done in previous calls, so it's not I can help you with there.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jordan Rohan with Stifel Nicolaus\nJordan Rohan: First just an accounting clarification, it should be pretty interesting, but the content cost for Prime Instant Video flowing to the cost of goods line even there is no direct revenue associated not into the tech and content line, right? Is that right?\nThomas Szkutak: That's correct.\nJordan Rohan: Okay. So, gross margins would be even higher if those costs were included elsewhere or broken out separately? It also seems like it's becoming a separate question. It's something kind of common or to reduce the carrying value of your investment in LivingSocial. Give a feel on a broad strategic level as to whether the local deals business through Amazon local or through LivingSocial is something that you care to keep investing in? Thanks.\nThomas Szkutak: There's not a lot I can specifically talk about as it relates to LivingSocial beyond, what's on our result today and what we'll have in our 10-K, which we filed soon, and so I would encourage you take a look at in our full disclosures related to that. But in terms of local, there certainly is still a very interesting opportunity there. We do have a couple, we have an investment in LivingSocial, we also have a local business ourselves. So, it's an interesting opportunity, it's a long-term opportunity in and we will continue to work on that customers to make that experience even better and you should think about it, not unlike a lot of the other businesses that we invest in with over long-term horizon and it's not very early there.\nSean Boyle: Okay. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-10-26 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.\nSean Boyle: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, October 25, 2012 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You\u2019ll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Sean. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion. Return on invested capital was 10%, down from 17%. ROIC trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter end. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares consistent with 469 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 27% to $13.81 billion or 30% excluding the $348 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We\u2019re grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $4.6 billion, up 11% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.56 billion up 36% or 39% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 62% of worldwide sales, up from 58%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded $188 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units. Now, I\u2019ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.32 billion or 74.7% of revenue compared with 76.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.26 billion or 23.6% of sales, up approximately 251 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.45 billion or 10.5% of revenue compared with 10%. Tech and content was $1.08 billion or 7.8% of revenue compared with 6.4%. Marketing was $524 million or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.3%. Now, I\u2019ll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 33% to $7.88 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $2.22 billion. EGM revenue grew 39% to $5.06 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 61%. North America segment operating income increased to 102% to $291 million, a 3.7% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 20% to $5.92 billion, adjusting for the $347 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact revenue growth was 27%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 30% to $3.5 billion or 39% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues up from 54%. International segment operating loss was $59 million, a 1% negative operating margin compared with income of $116 million. CSOI decreased 11% to $232 million or 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 71 basis points year-over-year, excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased to 10%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $28 million or 0.2% negative operating margin comparing with GAAP operating income of $79 million. Our income tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared with net income of $63 million and $0.14 per diluted share. Third quarter 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity-method share of losses reported by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets, including goodwill. As of the end of September the book value of our equity-method investment in LivingSocial was $94 million. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $1.08 billion year-over-year to $5.25 billion. Inventory increased 34% to $5.07 billion and inventory turns were 9.7, down from 10.8 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion and accounts payable days increased to 75 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures were $716 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. I\u2019ll conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumption. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they\u2019ve been recently. For Q4 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion, a growth of between 16% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $490 million loss to $310 million income compared to $260 million income in the prior year. This includes approximately $290 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between a $200 million loss and $600 million income compared to $462 million income in the prior year period. We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the purchase of our currently leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington. We remain head-sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. With that Sean, let\u2019s move to questions.\nSean Boyle: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes form Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.\nScott Devitt: Hi. Thank you. Two please, if I could, Tom. First on international margin, I know some of that actually is affected by currency. I was wondering, if you could speak to the effect of currency that it\u2019s having on margin. And then secondly, what else is driving that down? I would anticipate China investment digital and Italy and Spain being contributors there? Then secondly on shipping revenue up 44% year-over-year I was wondering if you could break that down between shipping revenue or more versus the revenue allocation of FBA? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: To take the first part of your question Scott, as it relates to operating profit in international you have the big pieces correct. First one is, we\u2019re investing certainly very heavily in capacity and so you\u2019re seeing that both fulfillment and infrastructure capacity that\u2019s impacting our results there. In addition to that, we\u2019re investing in the number of new geographies. We\u2019ve talked about Italy and Spain over the last several calls those are certainly having an impact. We\u2019re very excited about the opportunity that we have there, but certainly those are investments right now. China, as you also mentioned is creating a long-term opportunity for us, but certainly an investment and it is impacting that number. In addition, one that I don\u2019t think you did mention was video content for international. We\u2019re investing heavily in video content through our subsidiary LOVEFiLM for Europe. So those are things that are the primary drivers of what you\u2019re seeing in operating income in international. In terms of shipping revenue there is not a lot. I can help you, but there is a number of factors that go into that number. If you take a look at both, the shipping revenue and then the resulting net shipping cost of fuel, the net shipping cost is getting a little bit better. Over time it\u2019s getting closer and closer to customers with our RFC footprint. So those are some of things, but again a lot of dynamics that are certainly impacting that shipping revenue number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Citi.\nMark Mahaney: Great. Thanks. Any comments on the paid unit growth deceleration that seem to have been relatively significant, anything about the comp or any read into that? And secondly, given all the infrastructure investments you\u2019ve made, Tom you just mentioned some of the shipping efficiencies, you\u2019re also seeing fulfillment as a percentage of revenue kind of start narrowing a little bit. Do you think you\u2019ve reached a bit of a cyclical -- investment cyclical tipping point or am, I over reading into just one quarter? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the paid unit growth question, it was 39%. As you mentioned it was a deceleration from last quarter. Keep in mind still, the 39% growth is still growing at a faster rate than revenue, one. Two, if you take a look at last year\u2019s unit growth in Q3, the 53% that we had, that was the second highest quarter that we\u2019ve had in growth rate in the last 10 years. So we are overlapping a very strong growth last quarter. In terms of fulfillment expense, certainly as we\u2019ve talked about in the past few years, stepping up very heavily in 2010 and 2011, and \u201812 from a fulfillment standpoint, we\u2019ve just seen unprecedented growth. And we\u2019ve added a lot of capacity, in terms of where it will level off, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Right now, we\u2019re still experiencing very strong growth, with 30% growth on a local currency basis, 39% unit growth. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest where we need to and the fulfillment capacity we do have, we\u2019re going to make sure that we operate as efficiently as we can and get more efficient with that capacity over time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you. I had a question about pop-up stores. It seems like a lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon there. And we\u2019ve been hearing stuff recently about Amazon trying to leverage those as a way to get closer to customers, and help facilitate shipping for the holiday season. I\u2019m just wondering if you could share with us your strategy there.\nTom Szkutak: Yeah. Could you elaborate on what you\u2019re referring to? I\u2019m sorry.\nHeather Bellini: A pop-up store, meaning something that might only be open for between say, Black Friday and January 1st, a short-term store?\nTom Szkutak: The vast majority or the highest percentage of our revenue is certainly coming from our online sales. We do, in the case of Kindle are using physical world retailers as well, which we\u2019re very happy to do so. But again it\u2019s not really a driver of our business.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take a question now from Douglas Anmuth of J.P. Morgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Tom, it\u2019s been nearly a year since you launched the First Fire devices. And I was hopping, you could give us a sense of how that cohort of users might be tracking, in terms of their buyer activity and in particular, how you\u2019re seeing them if they are over indexing in terms of media content consumption, Prime usage and overall purchasing? And how do you feel about that strategy now as you continue to tie upon into devices? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Maybe the best way to describe it would be, certainly we\u2019re seeing customers certainly purchasing a lot of content. We like the idea of selling our Kindle Fires and then being rewarded through purchases of content going forward. All that being said, even though we\u2019re rewarded with those sales, customers realize that we\u2019re going to make sure that we work on behalf of them to make sure that content is not only very wide but also at great prices. And so, we continue to work with, to make sure that we can provide on customers behalf. But we\u2019re seeing a very good shopping patterns on all types of content with the selection that we have. We\u2019re seeing customers not only purchase content, we\u2019re seeing Prime customers certainly being active and watching our free content as well and that\u2019s working very well. So it\u2019s a great combination of things that are going on there in engagement with the device.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald.\nYoussef Squali: Yeah. Thank you very much. I actually want to follow-up on the question that was just asked. So, intuitively, it really makes a lot of sense what it is that you\u2019re doing. But can you maybe just speak to the effectiveness of selling the device or all these devices is kind of near breakeven? Maybe is there anticipate metric that you can point to help us understand the lifts you get either in terms of the frequency of buying or listing in average transaction value or anything that could kind of help us gauge from the outside the success of our strategy? And then second, maybe if you could just speak to the thinking behind your content costs related to your streaming service going forward, just how should we be thinking about it? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of -- there is not a lot of specifics I can give you on a per device basis from a content standpoint in terms of what the purchasing patterns have been, but as I mentioned in the previous question, certainly customers are engaged in the device they are purchasing content. They all are also, in the case of video, they\u2019re purchasing content as well as watching free content. In the case of books, they\u2019re purchasing books as well if they\u2019re Prime members. They\u2019re participating in free content. So those are things that are going very well. We like what we see there, which is why we continue to investment in that business, which is why you see the offerings, the very compelling offerings that we have out there right now. So those are things that you should expect us to do more of. In terms of the content spend, if you\u2019re referring to the \u2013 it\u2019s related to Prime Instant Video, I think it\u2019s probably what you\u2019re referring to. We have added a lot of content. We like what we see so far. We\u2019ll continue to monitor it very carefully. You should expect us to add more content going forward. We launched Prime, some number of years ago now and we had a little over 1 million items at launch. We then expanded that dramatically with many physical items. We\u2019re now offering digital items through Prime as well, most notably in, certainly in books and video and we\u2019re monitoring the performance very closely. But again, so far we\u2019re seeing great new subscribers coming out of these efforts and we like what we see so far.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies.\nBrian Pitz: Thanks. I know it\u2019s still early but, have you seen any noticeable impact from sales in states like California where they just started lighting you guys up on collecting sales tax?\nTom Szkutak: You\u2019re right. It is early. The only thing I could point to is, we collect in over -- either sales tax or equivalent value-added tax. We collect in over 50% of our revenue today. We have very good businesses in those states and geographies that we do that in long ago. That\u2019s all I can point to today.\nOperator: Now, we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: So, good afternoon, guys. So revisiting the capacity and infrastructure question overseas, anything you can share in terms of the operating environment and what is required to get the package to the customer? Over the longer term, are there any particular regions that you think may never reach the efficiency level, as you may currently see in your older geographies? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Actually, we feel very good about the investments we\u2019re making in fulfillment capacity. When I think about the types of investments that we\u2019re making in terms of predictability, certainly, I would consider the fulfillment capacity to be more of the running of the business type investments. We have a lot of experience starting up new facilities, operating those efficiently and to the point where, as you know we\u2019ve extended that not only to offer that service for our retail business, we also offer that to sellers to fulfill by Amazon. So those are things that we feel. Certainly those investments we feel good about but, what you\u2019re seeing is certain just a very large ramp that we\u2019ve done starting in 2010 through now. And you know it\u2019s one of these investments, we only make those investments where we absolutely need too. But in terms of deploying that capital is those resources, we feel very good about it.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Nowak of Nomura.\nBrian Nowak: Hi. Thanks. I have two questions, please. Can you talk to what you saw throughout Europe? Did you see any weakening in the European markets throughout the quarter, and if so any comments on specific pockets or countries of weakness? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about social and kind of use of social networks like Pinterest? Do you feel comfortable working with other social networks to drive business to Amazon as you are now, or do you think over the long-term or time you like to have more end-to-end control over social e-commerce? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the euro piece, we\u2019re not breaking out any specific countries in terms of growth. But as you can see from the results, we grew 27% in international and local currency basis, which includes obviously our footprint in Europe as well as China and Japan. So we feel the growth has been in the high-20s to low-30s over the past several quarters. Certainly, we\u2019re reading the same thing that you\u2019re reading in terms of the softness, hard to tell how much that\u2019s impacting us. Again, when you look at 27% growth rates still think that\u2019s pretty solid and the environment, again hard to tell how much we\u2019re impacting -- impacted by that. In terms of social, we\u2019re certainly very looking at a lot of different ways to reach our customers and certainly that\u2019s an opportunity for us and something that our -- certainly our advertising and marketing teams are very conscious of and working on ways to best monetize those channels.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Sandler: Hi. Great, guys. Just two quick questions. First is on Brazil, second on fulfillment. So you guys are hiring in Brazil for local content relationships for Kindle and some warehouse personnel. So how important do you view that market in terms of the retail business. When do you think you could be in Brazil with the retail presence? And then the second question is fulfillment, as a growth -- as a percent of gross profit showed year-on-year leverage for the first time in like three years, so do you feel like you\u2019ve turned the corner on some of the capacity improvements or given the pace of new facility that you\u2019re putting in. Is there any reason why that would reverse back down again from here?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the first question, we have a longstanding practice of not talking about what we might or might not do. Certainly, Brazil is an interesting geography as well as there are others. And we certainly export to Brazil today, but beyond that there\u2019s not a lot to talk to. In terms of fulfillment, you are seeing a little bit of leverage in Q3 versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past few years. Again, it\u2019s one quarter, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that at this stage. But certainly, we feel good about the footprint that we have. We feel good about a lot of the capacity that we\u2019ve added since 2010. Some of that capacity going back is getting more productive than it had been. The challenging part is obviously we\u2019re layering on a sizable number of [FC] this year on top of that, that you\u2019re seeing the cost for. So, there is again the 19 that we\u2019ve announced today.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Miller of William Blair.\nMark Miller: Hi, good afternoon. Could you share what you\u2019ve learnt with the add-on program and the purchase rate you\u2019re seeing? And do you think over time you can have a meaningful expansion of smaller ticket items and can that effect the percent of orders that have multiple items in the shipment?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of add-ons, we\u2019re -- a goal is to try to make products available to customers that we aren\u2019t able to make available to before. And so it\u2019s very early, but that\u2019s the -- it\u2019s just one additional way that we can add selection for customers and be able to get it to customer profitably. So again, it\u2019s not much more towards than that.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go now to Herman Leung of Susquehanna.\nHerman Leung: Great. Thanks, guys. Two quick questions. I guess when you look into your holiday as you might go into the holiday season with your third-party inventory last year hitting sort of a bump with video games, as well as some of the Thailand floods. I was wondering what types of steps you guys are kind of doing to better prepare yourselves for holiday season that this upcoming holiday season? And the second question is wondering, how we should think about the increasing cost -- shipping cost leverage as you go into 2013 with your distribution centers much closer and a higher percentage of FBA units? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of holiday readiness, we feel very good. We\u2019re -- as you can see from our inventory at the end of Q3 it started, we\u2019re adding inventory getting ready for the holiday season that will happen throughout Q4. We\u2019re continuing trying to increase our in stock levels. So, you\u2019re certainly seeing some of that already in the numbers. And we\u2019re very excited about getting ready for a great holiday season. And that\u2019s with our own retail inventory. Certainly, we haven\u2019t sellers, we\u2019re selling on a platform would be doing the same thing. And we\u2019re getting forward to have a great experience for customers during Q4. In terms of shipping cost leverage, I think there is a great opportunity over a longer period of time in terms of providing what there would happen from a short-term leverage standpoint to be premature to that at this stage. But we can checking in future periods and talk more about that.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go now to Anthony DiClemente of Barclays.\nAnthony DiClemente: I have just one question. On the North America media segment just a modest deceleration. I would imagine that digital content sales and download to rent probably grew much faster than the growth rate of that segment. And so, I\u2019m just wondering if there is anything specifically that you can call out that was weighing that growth down in that segment, whether it\u2019s physical media or otherwise? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: I think you\u2019ve characterized it correctly. Digital content is growing very fast. And it\u2019s reflected in the number that you see there, beyond that there is not a lot of call outs with the exception of. If you look back over the past five quarters, certainly the highest growth we\u2019ve had will be Q3 of 2011, which we\u2019re lapping. So, that\u2019s the other factor. But again, very good growth on the digital media also keep in mind, that the growth of digital will also trail our device sales and given the new launches that we\u2019ve had recently that\u2019s -- that will be good for our digital content to going forward.\nOperator: Now, we\u2019ll take a question from Michael Graham of Canaccord Adams.\nMichael Graham: Hi, good afternoon. Tom, last quarter you made a comment that same day delivery on a wide scale wasn\u2019t a goal. And since then, I\u2019ve got more anecdotal evidence of people getting a lot of same day delivery especially here in New York. There was some news from Wal-Mart that they were going to start shipping from their stores. So could you give us any updated thoughts or philosophy you might have around what\u2019s an appropriate amount of time to strive for to deliver to people? And then as a quick follow-up to that, it seems like every quarter you\u2019re guiding to sort of 1% operating margins. And just wondering like is that a philosophical way that you\u2019re managing the business. Is there sort of an infinite number of things that you guys could spend on if you wanted to. And we should expect this sort of level going forward?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of same day delivery or delivery speed, we have just a tremendous amount of selection and what I was referring to last time was, I said, I talked about with a large amount of selection broadly to that certainly challenging to do same day everywhere, it\u2019s certainly a challenge from an economic standpoint. That being said, we -- if you look back over the past several years, we have done -- added a lot of capacity. We\u2019re getting -- we have large FCs that are closer and closer to customers that has helped improve our delivery speed to customers and programs like Prime specifically has helped us get closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint. So, what I would expect moving forward would be more the same. We\u2019re going to continue to improve the customer experience in every possible way we can, which includes getting closer to customers from a shipping standpoint. And we feel good about that and again, you\u2019ve seen improvements some in the past year and in the past several years and New York is one of those examples, where you\u2019re seeing certainly indoor shipments going in the same day in cases.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Justin Post of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Thank you. Just thinking about this investment cycle, it\u2019s been like two years and a quarter and yet our revenues decelerating a little bit and free cash flow and margin trends are continuing to be down kind of down year-over-year. Can you just talk about, what you\u2019re seeing on the returns on the investments you\u2019ve been making over the last two years? And as far as like return on investment capital, is the profile of your returns changing over time as you think about history? And then when can we start seeing kind of returns on this as far as revenues improving or kind of some of the financial ratios starting to turn. Can give us any thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about that? And then, just have a financial question. U.S. revenues for other were up 63% and then international was plus 15 for other and I think the difference is AWS. Is there any other big differences between the two geographies that we should think about? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of return on invested capital beyond the total numbers, there is not any specifics that I can point to right now. But what I can tell you is, in terms of your profile if you think about the parts of our business. The retail business, I feel very good. We have a lot of experience in terms of getting greats returns for our shareowners. We feel something that we have, again a lot of experience in. As we\u2019ve added new categories in particular geographies. Oftentimes, we\u2019ve already launched those in other geographies. So we\u2019re able to learn from the experiences we\u2019ve had to-date. So, we feel good about those. We have a great portion of our businesses. And our media business is converting to digital. So, we\u2019ve talked a lot about that. And feel very good about the opportunity that we have there, both in terms of making great devices as well as integrating content into those devices. So, we feel good about that business and its growing very fast. In terms of our Web Services business that\u2019s a -- if you start with the core operation of that business. We\u2019ve been in that part of the business serving Amazon, the customer since inception. We\u2019ve added a lot of new services that have helped both Amazon internally, as well as external customers. We like the characteristics of the potential ROIC potential of those of that business as well. Our third-party business continues to grow on our consumer business dramatically. And we like the ROIC potential of those. We\u2019re investing in a lot of new geographies, a few in the last couple of years, on top that China. China\u2019s you should think about that one has more of the long-term opportunity, something that we\u2019ve been investing in for several years, you shouldn\u2019t be expecting high returns on invested capital in the short run in that geography, but very exciting from a long-term perspective. Italy and Spain, we\u2019re in an investment mode in those geographies. But again, those are more in line with some of the other geographies we\u2019re in, in terms of timeline for returns and feel very good about those. So, hopefully that gives you some picture of a little bit of the landscape and how we\u2019re thinking about ROICs.\nSean Boyle: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-07-26 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.\nSean Boyle: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2012, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared with $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-months free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital was 11%, down from 21%. ROIC is trailing 12-months free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock, stock-based awards outstanding, was 468 million share compared with 468 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 29% to $12.83 billion or 32% excluding the $272 million, unfavorable impact from the year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $4.12 billion, up 13% or 15% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.16 billion, up 38% or 42% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 59%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 43%. Active customer counts exceeded to 180 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 40% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q2 of 2011. Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $9.49 billion, or 73.9% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined, was $2.99 billion or 23.3% of sales up approximately 307 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.3 billion or 10.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Tech and content was $970 million or 7.6% of revenue compared with 6.3%. Marketing was $521 million or 4.1% of revenue compared with 3.3%. Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America\u2019s segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.33 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.87 billion, EGM revenue grew 41% to 4.94 billion representing 67% of North America revenues up from 65%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $344 million a 4.7% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 22% to 5.51 billion adjusting for the $269 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. Media revenue grew 8% to 2.25 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 34% to 3.22 billion or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues up from 53%. International segment operating income decreased 91% to 16 million or 0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 74%. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to 360 million or 2.8% of revenue down approximately 109 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange CSOI decreased 4%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 47% to $107 million or 0.8% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $109 million a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter and includes a one-time expense of $51 million related to the integration of Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective tax rate is higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate and our 2011 effective tax rate. GAAP net income was $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared with $191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 million of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva Systems. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased 1.39 billion year-over-year to 4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36% to 4.3 billion and inventory turns were 10.1 down from 11.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to 7.07 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year. Our Q2 2012 capital expenditures were $657 million, the increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon web services and additional capacity to support our funding operations. I\u2019ll conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be properly conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainties surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisition, investments or settlement, record any further revision for stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For the Q3 2012 we expect net sales of between 12.9 and 14.3 billion or growth between 19 and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between 350 million loss and 50 million loss down from 79 million income in the comparable prior year period. This includes approximately $275 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $75 million loss and $225 million in income, or between a 129% decline and 14% decline. We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of a continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon web service and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. We remain heads on focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholder. Thanks. With that, Sean, we will move to questions.\nSean Boyle: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Spencer Wang with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: Thanks, good afternoon. Just one question on Kiva and a couple of parts, Tom. Now that you have closed the acquisition, can you talk about how you will deploy the Kiva technology? Is that for new fulfillment centers only or can you use that in your legacy fulfillment centers and perhaps what type efficiencies that could gain. And then last part would be, is there any impact on your 3Q guidance from the Kiva acquisition specifically? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. In terms of Kiva itself, we are very very excited to have Kiva as part of the Amazon team. You know we are looking forward to getting great productivity over time through the use. But again it\u2019s very early and you\u2019ll just have to stay tuned in terms of the plan. In terms of the impact, you mentioned Q3. Let me just provide a little bit of data on both Q2 actuals and Q3. In terms GAAP operating income in Q2, it was negative $25 million. For Q3 it\u2019s approximately negative $35 million. And then on the net income for Q2, it was a loss of approximately $65 million. And so those are the numbers for Q2 and Q3. But again we are very very happy to have them part of them and that we look forward to working with them going forward.\nOperator: We will go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: Question on the gross margin, continues to climb up, and I was wondering if you could give any commentary there around how agency versus wholesale and eBooks is contributing to that?\nTom Szkutak: Yeah, the bigger issue is not that, it\u2019s related to overall 3P, a number of factors of different factors certainly driving the improvement in product gross margins that you are referring to. But as it relates to 3P, it\u2019s on the broader 3P. So if you take a look at from a units perspective, third party was 40% of our total units in Q2. That\u2019s up from 36%. So it\u2019s approximately 400 basis points increase as a percentage of total units which is certainly one of the factors that you are seeing there.\nOperator: We will go next to Herman Leung with Susquehanna.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Deepak] sitting in for Herman. So the question I had was on the hardware business. So how important do you think is the hardware strategy to you for the digital content? Now given that Kindle Fire has been out there for a while, so could you discuss about the strategy on the business and how it\u2019s driving the digital content?\nTom Szkutak: Sure. You know we are very excited about both the hardware and the content of the business. We think if you take a look at our devices, certainly it\u2019s very integrated, which is great for customers. So we think it\u2019s incredible experience. And so we have been very excited about the progress we have made so far from both a device and content standpoint. And we are super excited about the road map that we have. So again, that\u2019s again, very, very happy with what the team is doing there.\nOperator: And we will go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura Equity Research.\nAram Rubinson: This is Aram Rubinson sitting in for Brian Nowak. I notice your shipping cost was lower as a percent of sales for the first time in nearly three years. The driver it looks like it's shipping cost per unit which fell about 10%. Can you talk about how much of that might be attributable to proximity of distribution centers to metro areas, lower fuel, more favorable carrier pricing etcetera, and whether or not you see anything on the horizon that would change that course.\nTom Szkutak: Yes, we are seeing, there is a number of different factors, but certainly one of them is we are getting closer to customers and that\u2019s just with our wide [multitude of film] networks, so that\u2019s really having an impact on that. And again we have a lot of opportunities to improve that overtime, but again the team is making good progress and you are seeing that reflected in the results so far.\nOperator: We will go next to Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\nPaul Bieber: This is Paul Bieber for Justin. Just going back for the gross margin question, I was wondering if you could give us some color on the relative impact of few different things; category, maturity, advertising, 3P, and maybe digital content on gross margins, which ones are impacting gross margins more than others. And then just quick question on the taxes. What were the impact of sales tax in Texas and California beyond gross margins?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of your question on gross margins, we are not breaking that up but certainly 3P is having the impact, mix of businesses having an impact. We continue to try to work with our partners to get even better prices on the goods that we provide for customers which is certainly impacting it. Mix of business things like [AWS] is certainly impacting that as well, given the growth rate there. So, again those are things that are impacting. In terms of sales taxes, any impact that we certainly would expect to see would be included in guidance that we are giving for Q3, but one thing to keep in mind as it relates to that is we right now approximately 50% of our business around the world, we either collect sales tax or value added tax. We have very good businesses in those jurisdictions and so [keep that in mind] you should think about any upcoming changes.\nOperator: We will go next to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nKaizad Gotla: This is Kaizad Gotla in for Doug. Just a couple of questions, can you discuss the international media deceleration, it looks like it decelerated from 22 to 12% on an ex-FX basis. And then can you maybe just give us an update on the fulfillment center plans for the rest of the year. Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: I\u2019ll take international in total first and then, you know that the same is true for media, and really I\u2019ll even start with the total business. Total business grew 32%. One thing to keep this on currency basis, one thing to keep in mind is for both the total business international growth and international media, we had a very, very strong growth last year Q2. In fact our total growth rate last year was 51% for the total business and on a local currency basis that was 44% growth, that\u2019s the highest growth quarter we\u2019ve had in over 10 years. And so when you look at that, when you are comparing ourselves in Q2 this year, we had very good growth given that compare to last year, and that some of which we are seeing also in international media as you mentioned. So, international media was up 8%, on a local currency basis so it was up 12 and certainly it's a challenging compare. Also there were some things just with, as we some timely things as we launched with the unfortunate events in Japan last year, we certainly did have some releases that with scope of relating the quarter obviously didn\u2019t happened, they moved into Q2 just from a supply standpoint those are certainly impacting that region and some other things. So it\u2019s, again, think of it in terms of the comparison point for last year is probably the best thing to do.\nOperator: We will go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.\nRohit Kulkarni: This is Rohit Kulkarni filling in for Mark. Couple of questions. Can you talk about, or disclose anything about mobile, how that\u2019s affecting your business. eBay talked about mobile affecting their growth rates quite materially, perhaps even by a few percentage points and accounting for almost 10% of their revenues maybe. And second is, can you talk about the broad philosophy of management about short-term profitability versus long-term growth. Probably this is the first time in a while that you have bracketed negative pro forma operating income in your guidance. How should we view your short-term investment or the short-term profitability outlook.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. First in terms on mobile. Clearly, smartphones and tablets are a significant tailwind for our business. While we are not breaking out the numbers, it\u2019s a big tailwind on our business and it\u2019s going great. So we are seeing a very nice impact from that and again it\u2019s a tailwind that we expect that will continue. In terms of short term versus long-term, you know we are all about trying to make sure we do the right long-term things for both customers and shareowners. But more specifically around Q3, you know Q3 is similar to Q2 and other previous quarters and that we are investing certainly for the long term. Yet, on the flip side, keep in mind, as you look at Q3 specifically, we are getting ready for a most seasonal quarter and we expect, given the growth that we have had, we are seeing very strong growth so we are investing heavily to get ready for that. In terms of capacity for example, we have announced 18 new fulfillment centers so far this year. We have actually opened eight of those already this year, out of the 18. And we are looking at potentially opening even more than that. I am sorry, six opened so far this year, out of 18. So those are certainly something are impacting the cost so far and you will be seeing that heavier in Q3 as we get ready for the most seasonal quarter.\nOperator: We will go next to Mark Miller with William Blair.\nMark Miller: Hi, I was hoping, you could share some perspective on your URL expansion strategy. I\u2019d like to know, I guess some sense for the growth you are seeing there and how material it is in your overall numbers. And should we expect to see further expansion in those sites.\nTom Szkutak: Yeah. There\u2019s not a lot I can you know help you with there. We are certainly looking as you would expect us to do, ways to continue to grow and certainly that will be part of our strategy.\nOperator: We will go next to Scott Tillman with Caris & Company.\nScott Tillman: Tom, I was just curious, we have had a few quarters where operating income has far surpassed the upper end of your guidance range and we had a quarter here you definitely seemed to weaken as the months went by. Just wondering what you think is causing that divergence between sort of expectation at the beginning of the quarter and how things are playing out. Then just as a quick follow up to one of the other questions. You are looking at the fulfillment center network, just wondering if you are satisfied with the fee increases that were put in place in February that that business is now matching the margin for the rest of the business.\nTom Szkutak: I am sorry, could you elaborate on the months going by, I wasn\u2019t following your question.\nScott Tillman: On operating income, we have had a couple of -- a few quarters here where the numbers have come in far better than guidance. And we actually had a situation where Europe actually got worst as the quarter went on. So wondering what is driving that out performance.\nTom Szkutak: Got it. You know we, certainly as you look at, I will talk to Q2 since it\u2019s the most recent quarter, but we had a lot of strength across many different areas. One of the ones I mentioned that certainly helped our operating profit as well as our gross margin with the third party business continued to be very very strong. And certainly that was a factor. Again, there was a number of factors. One thing too, you do see some timing differences to some extent between Q2 and Q3 in terms of our prep for Q4, you see that knowing our operating results, but you see that in our CapEx. In the last 90 days ago we said that we would spend approximately 800 to $900 million of CapEx for Q2, we spent little less than 700. You see that number for Q3 being 8 to 900 as well. It's 900 million. So, again those are things that you are seeing just a little bit of a shift between Q2 and Q3 there.\nOperator: We will go next to Ron Josey with ThinkEquity.\nRon Josey: I wanted to ask you a quick on 3P and given it's around 40% of sale this year, item sold. What point you believe the customer experience on Amazon is at risk given the rise of third-party sales. And any insight in terms of adoption on FBA by third parties would be very helpful. And then one quick follow-up just on your comments on CapEx, I think you said, it came in lower in 2Q, guidance is for another 8 to 900 million, is that guidance sort of consistent maybe going out, going forward or is this sort of one-time build around technology. Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the third party units, certainly FBA is having an impact on that, that\u2019s one of the drivers, certainly that\u2019s helping us have that percentage of total units go up. And we have looked at and we have been working very hard over a number of years on improving the experience for both customers and for sellers and FBA is an example of that. And what ends up happening is FBA sellers wants their part of the program, those units that FBA and our fulfillment network are eligible for all of our programs including free super saver shipping, prime. So, again those are great, certainly that\u2019s a great program for our customers, it's great program for seller and it's great program for investors. And I don\u2019t of it as a bad thing at all, I think of it as a good thing. We have a lot of retail units that we send directly to customers, we are offering a great experience on third party units which includes FBA and a number of other programs that we have. So, again we will continue to try to make that even better for customers overtime, but it's working very well, and again those are the benefit of having third parties on a platform is we get to [equate] some new selection. We also have competing offers directly on our detail pages, so when customers come they get to choose in terms of who they want to purchase from. So, it's a competitive environment on our platform. So, we think that\u2019s great for customers and for us.\nOperator: We will go next to So Young Lee with SunTrust.\nSo Young Lee: I was just curious about LivingSocial, it seem to be a bigger loss unusual, can you give us some color on what happened perhaps. And secondly, can you talk about the kind of traction you are getting with LOVEFiLM given all of the exclusive content you are getting there.\nTom Szkutak: LOVEFiLM business is doing very well. It's growing nicely as you mentioned we continue to add content there, and we plan on having more content there overtime. I\u2019m very excited to have that business at part of Amazon and the team is doing great. In terms of LivingSocial there is a not a lot, I can add to it other than what we have disclosed.\nOperator: We will go next to Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.\nAndrew McNellis: This is Andrew McNellis in for Ken. Somewhat related to other questions that have been asked, could you provide any update to your same day shipping efforts and how that relates to sales tax and performance in your investment?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of delivery speed to customers, we are certainly trying to get geographically, always trying to get closer to customers, that\u2019s something that\u2019s not new, it's something we have been doing for some time. But in terms of same day, we don\u2019t really see a way to do same day delivery on a broad scale economically. But again we will continue to work on behalf of customers to try to figure out a way to serve them even better by getting product faster but in terms of same day, we don\u2019t see a way to do that on a broad scale economically.\nOperator: We will go next to Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.\nPerry Gold: This is Perry Gold on for Anthony. Can you please touch on the online sales tax issue and how it could affect your build out strategy for fulfillment centers?\nTom Szkutak: You know as I mentioned earlier, we have -- we do collect in several states within the U.S. We do collect in a number of geographies that have an equivalent value added tax, approximately half for our business. We actually sales tax, the value added tax. We do very good business in those geographies. Those geographies reflected, for the most part, if you go back on the last several years, most of them have been included. We have also certainly added some new geographies or new jurisdictions that we clocked during that time period. But you see that we have seen very very strong growth even while collecting. So we are very supportive of collecting. We think the best way to do that is through a federal solution and we keep working with Congress and others to try to get that passed.\nOperator: We will go next to Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.\nKerry Rice: Kind of sales tax issue again. Amazon signed a lot of bilateral agreements with several states on the collection of sales tax. And I know there is a federal effort also going on. Can you talk about if a federal sales tax is passed, how does that impact your bilateral agreements with the states. Does that supersede it or does that kind of have to continue to go on with those particular states and build those fulfillment centers and things in those states that you have agreed to.\nTom Szkutak: There is not a lot I can add to that. So I can't be that helpful with your question, I apologize. But again, you are right, we do support federal legislation, we are working very hard at that. One thing to keep In mind to, we price our products irrespective of what sales tax is, that\u2019s a customer obligation and so we are pricing products very well. And so that\u2019s not something that we just started doing, that\u2019s something that we have been doing for a long time. And that\u2019s why we have a good business in those geographies and jurisdictions where we do collect. And because customers are coming to us because they want to have value which we offer irrespective of tax, there has been a number of different third parties that have certainly reported on that. They come because they want great convenience, they want obviously great service, and those are things we are focused and those are the things that we believe customers will still want over the long-term and that\u2019s why are focused on those areas.\nOperator: We will go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMatt Nemer: The international segment operating income has been under a lot of pressure. Is that primarily related to existing markets, growth in new markets? And would that be on the merchandize margin side of the P&L or is it more of an operating cost issue.\nTom Szkutak: Keep in mind with international, it\u2019s a mix of geographies and we are -- certainly there are some that we are investing in. We mentioned certainly in other calls, China is an area that is growing very fast but we are certainly in investment mode there. In recent years, we have launched Italy and Spain. We are certainly investing in those geographies and like what we see there. Those are certainly impacting. We are also adding a lot of fulfillment capacity. And so those are the things that are certainly impacting those numbers.\nOperator: We will take our last question from Atul Bagga with Lazard Capital.\nAtul Bagga: I have two questions. One on guidance and the other one prime members. Can you give us some color on guidance, what you are baking for growth in international versus domestic? And guidance implies there is some compression in margin. Is it again mostly the function of the sales mix or is something else going on there. And then a second on prime members. Can you remind us the profitability of prime members versus non-prime member and in the longer-term where do you think the penetration of prime members within your overall base?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of revenue, we don\u2019t break out the segments in terms of the split. But if you take a look at our guidance, it\u2019s to grow between 19% and 31%. And if you look at the impact of exchange, it\u2019s a little over 400 basis points and so rounded it's just under 36% on the high end and 23% on the low end. And so that\u2019s the range of guidance and so we are certainly pleased with what we saw in Q2 and certainly giving as we have in past quarters a wide range for Q3. In terms of the bottom line, in terms of operating income and CSOI guidance that we have given, as I mentioned earlier, certainly a number of different factors like the last several quarters, as we have been talking about we are certainly investing a lot in the business, but one thing to keep in mind is for the guidance in upcoming quarter to Q3. And we are certainly getting ready given the growth rates we had for our most seasonal quarter, that\u2019s certainly impacting the bottom line in terms of our guidance and as I mentioned earlier we opened a lot of performance centers, adding a lot of capacity for both our web service businesses as well as infrastructure support. Our retail business, so again we are investing across the business which is like all the periods, but again we are getting ready for Q4.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll turn it back over to our speaker\u2019s for any additional or closing remarks.\nTom Szkutak: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-04-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2012 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead, sir.\nSean Boyle: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2012, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with our comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 1% to $3.05 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 39% to $1.15 billion. Return on invested capital was 12%, down from 24%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 464 million shares compared with 466 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock for $960 million. Worldwide revenue grew 34% to $13.18 billion or 34% excluding the $56 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $4.71 billion, up 19% or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $7.97 billion, up 43% or 43% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 60% of worldwide sales, up from 57%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 49%. Active customer accounts exceeded 173 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 39% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in the Q1 2011. Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.03 billion or 76.1% of revenue compared with 77.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.76 billion or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 283 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.26 billion or 9.5% of revenue compared with 8.4%. Tech and content was $816 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $468 million or 3.6% of revenue compared with 3.2%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation expense or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.43 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $2.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 44% to $4.77 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 60%. North America segment operating income increased 20% to $349 million, a 4.7% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $5.76 billion. Adjusted for the $55 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 32%. Media revenue grew 21% to $2.51 billion or 22%, excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 40% to $3.2 billion or 42%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 56% of International revenues, up from 52%. International segment operating income decreased 72% to $49 million, a 0.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 65%. CSOI decreased 15% to $398 million or 3% of revenue, down approximately 170 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 14%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 40% to $192 million or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $43 million in Q1, resulting in a 51% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $130 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared with $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $1.17 billion year-over-year to $5.71 billion. Inventory increased 47% to $4.25 billion and inventory turns were 10.4, down from 11.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $6.89 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 62 from 66 in the prior year. Our Q1 2012 capital expenditures were $386 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including the Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes the financial results on the Kiva Systems acquisition, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2012, and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q2 2012, we expect net sales of between $11.9 billion and $13.3 billion or growth of between 20% and 34%. This guidance anticipates approximately 240 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $260 million loss and $40 million of income or between 229% decline and 80% decline. This includes approximately $260 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between 0 and $300 million or between 100% decline and 22% decline. We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.\nSean Boyle: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: Tom, just a couple quick questions. One, I was wondering if you could update us on your plans for fulfillment center increases in 2012. And then also on Prime Instant Video, you guys are over 17,000 movies and TV episodes now. Are you guys at a critical mass? Or do you guys expect to continue to invest aggressively there? And one last quick clarification question, the CapEx guidance, was that for the second quarter or the full year?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. I'll take the last one first. The CapEx was for the second quarter. And the first question on fulfillment centers, in terms of announcements so far that are out there, we've announced 13 for 2012. And so certainly, any changes to that, we'd be back to you. But again, we're experiencing very, very strong growth both in terms of retail but also our FBA. We're seeing that in our third-party growth. Our third-party growth increased in Q1 over 60% again this quarter. Again, a big piece of that was certainly FBA is doing very well. So again, we're continuing to invest, and the number is 13.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.\nScott W. Devitt: Tom, I just had a question around the operating margin dynamics in the North American market versus International. If you look at it year-over-year, I guess, or even sequentially, the International margin is down pretty materially, but you had a significant uptick in the North American margins, so sequentially and just a moderate decline year-over-year. So wondering if you can just clarify what's happening in North America versus the International markets. Is it 3P FBA having a more significant effect in the U.S. versus other markets? And then I had one follow-up question.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the -- we're investing heavily in both segments. But what you're seeing is, clearly, if you look at over the past couple years, we've launched a few new geographies, Italy and Spain. We're investing in those geographies. As we've talked about in the past, China, we continue to invest there. We think it's growing very fast. We like what we see. We think it's a great long-term opportunity for investing there. So those are some of the dynamics that are impacting International. And so we continue to invest again across both geographies. But those are things that are a little bit different. In terms of third-party growth, we're seeing very strong third-party growth across International, as well as North America, so we're pleased to do that. And we're investing again on behalf of customers and sellers, as well as retail for the capacity that we need to do that.\nScott W. Devitt: And then secondly, on the employee base growth, I don't know if thinking about unit growth is the right way to think about it. But is there a point in time where you think the employee base starts to grow more in line possibly with unit growth? And can you maybe walk through where you're adding most significantly that's driving the headcount growth?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. We are adding a lot of resources across a number of different areas. But certainly if you look at both year-over-year and sequentially, the Q1 numbers that you're looking at, the vast majority of that is in operations and customer service. Again, and those are based on the hirings that we did coming out of Q4. We have a lot of -- we do supplement our workforce with temporaries in Q4. We did hire a number of those coming out of Q4. And those are reflected in the numbers. And to answer your other question, yes, we'll moderate it at some point certainly. But again, we're -- given the growth that we're experiencing right now, we are investing and we're making sure that we have the right resources to do that.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.\nMark S. Mahaney: Tom, could you just provide a little more color on the gross margin trends? And it also looks within that like shipping for the first time in a while shows a little bit less deleverage than it has in the past. Is there some sort of tipping point you've reached there? And just broadly on gross margins, that real drive-up that you've seen over the last couple of quarters, is that primarily just due to product mix shifts or revenue mix shifts? Is there anything else in there? And then could you also just briefly comment on AmazonSupply.com? Would some of that -- all of the inventory that you've built up for that launch, would was that -- have we seen that in the buildup in inventory and the reduction in turns? Or are we going to see that going forward?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the -- we're not reporting gross margin specifically. But in terms of -- if you take a look at the relationship between COGS and revenue, certainly, one of the things we're seeing, a number of different factors there, certainly mix of business is one. But another factor is certainly the one I mentioned earlier, which is around third-party growth. We saw very strong unit growth overall this quarter, up from last quarter, so we had sequential growth. Third-party units as a percentage of total units were up approximately 300 basis points over last year. And we saw just great third-party unit growth, so it was up over 60% again in Q1. And so those are factors that are certainly impacting our operating margins, if you will. In terms of supply -- AmazonSupply.com, certainly, we have inventory on hand to support that business. It's certainly something that we're optimistic over the long-term. But in terms of the inventory increase that you've seen, it's very broad over a number of different businesses and categories and geographies. So that's really what's driving it.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: I had 2 for you. First, I was wondering if you could talk about just over the last few years if you could give us a sense how much of the third-party increase has been related to agency e-books. And then the second question is in light of the DOJ case, I was wondering if you could walk us through your thoughts about the agency e-book model, as well as whether or not this will mean we should see things move back to wholesale.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes. There's not a lot I can help you with there in terms of the questions. We do think that the suit is a big win for Kindle owners. And we look forward to being allowed to lower prices on more Kindle books. It's certainly our unit growth, if you will, in total -- I'm not talking 3P, just in total. Certainly, the paid unit growth has been certainly helped a lot by e-books. It's growing, as you can imagine very, very fast, so it's certainly impacting that growth rate that you've seen over the past few years, which has been great for us and great for customers. So beyond that, there's not a lot I can add to your questions.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.\nKenneth Sena: In your press release, you mentioned the launch of your Amazon Appstore. And can you just share any thoughts on current traction on Android or specifically off Kindle Fire? And what are some of the advantages and disadvantages that you see for Amazon in that area?\nThomas J. Szkutak: It's early, so there's not a lot I can do. We're excited about it. We think it's a very interesting opportunity and happy to do that on behalf of our customers. But stay tuned, and it's early.\nKenneth Sena: And maybe one more follow-up. If you can just maybe talk about any of the traction you're seeing within Kindle Fire more broadly or any thoughts you have maybe around Kindle smartphone, that'd be great, too.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the Kindle Fire, we are pleased with the growth that we're seeing and customers are buying a lot of content. And you're seeing that when you look at particularly in North America. When you look at our North American media growth from Q4 to Q1, you're seeing that accelerate. And that's certainly a big part of it. And so we're very pleased with what's happening, and we're going to continue to add more and more content for customers and across all of our digital categories. And we think we have a great value proposition for customers today, and we're going to continue to make that better over time.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: I want to ask 2 things, Tom. If you could first just give us some more color on the outlook around segment operating income in 2Q and just how we should be thinking about the drivers there in terms of the sequential decline. And then secondly, just the North American media business, you saw good reacceleration from 4Q to 1Q. Can you talk about the factors there leading to that acceleration?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. I'll take the second one first on North American media. I just mentioned that a little bit in one of the previous questions. But certainly, our digital media growth has been great and certainly it's helping that. One other call-out, just to keep in mind, in Q4, I had mentioned that video games, including video game consoles, the consoles are part of North America media, that's a seasonal business that was bringing down growth in Q4. So it's also something to keep in mind. In terms of our guidance, we've given a pretty broad range on both the top and the bottom as we have previously. We think the segment operating income on the bottom end of the range is certainly appropriately conservative. But again, things that you should think about, we'll continue to add capacity as we've talked about in the past. With the growth that we're experiencing, we are adding more. And as I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we've announced approximately 13 new fulfillment centers. So those are as a result of the growth that we're experiencing. We're also adding capacity to support AWS in our retail business on the infrastructure side as well. So those are things to think about as you think about Q2 from a segment operating income, as well as the CapEx that I mentioned in the opening. Another area is certainly our digital offerings. We are certainly adding more content, and specifically, more video content, which will be as reflected in our guidance. And so those are factors, among others, that you should think about.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nCharles Eugene Munster: Another question on gross margin. It was obviously impressive results, the best in 3 years almost. And it's been a little bit of a roller coaster in terms of the profitability quarter-to-quarter. And we understand that you're in an investment phase and there's a massive opportunity ahead of you. Is there anything that you can tell us as we think going forward over the next few quarters? Just is the investment philosophy that played through this quarter going to play on in other quarters? Or is each quarter kind of its own 3 months and it could go either way?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes. Gene, in terms of guidance, we're just giving guidance on Q2 today. But the one thing I would say is again we're seeing very good growth, as you see in Q1 and reflected in the guidance for Q2. And we'll have to stay tuned to see what it looks like for the remainder of the year as we progress. But we're extremely happy with the opportunities that we have. We think it's -- we're in a great position with the opportunities that we have. Even though we've reached some scale, we just have tremendous opportunities in front of us. And that's why we're investing in those.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura.\nBrian Nowak: I have a couple of questions. The first one is I know there's a lot of focus on kind of CSOI margins and margin pressure from the build. But I was just curious if you still see areas of your business in the oldest part of your business, where you think you have inefficiencies you can still work to improve execution and kind of get some margin lift out of those in the oldest part of the business just to improve execution. And the second one is any more clarity on how much roughly Quidsi and Lovefilm added to revenue growth this quarter?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of opportunities for improvement, even though we've made a lot of progress, we still feel we have a lot of room for improvement in all parts of our business. Certainly, the most opportunity is the newer parts. But certainly if you go back and look at -- we're still trying to get great productivity and putting together programs to get great productivity in each of our operations. And so there's really too many to list here on the call today. But we look at in all facets for our business in terms of productivity. We think there's opportunities to partner with vendors even more to get better savings and better prices for customers. So the list is long. But I think when you look at the opportunities in terms of the ranking, in terms of at least basis points improvement, start with the newer things that we've launched -- at least directionally, the newer things that we've launched, work your way backwards, and those were usually where the biggest opportunities are in terms of basis points.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMatthew R. Nemer: Just going back to the \"gross margin\", is it fair to say, given the change in that metric and the change in third-party units, that potentially the core margins in 1P really accelerated in the first quarter in addition to there being a continued mix shift to 3P? That's my first question. And then secondly, can you comment on any product categories in either media or EGM that either held you back in the quarter or were a tailwind? I think last quarter you mentioned video games and a few categories in terms of giving some color.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes. In terms of the second part of the question, I think the -- in terms of any headwinds, I would say there's a few areas, as we talked about last quarter with some of the supply issues that we had related to the Thailand floods that caused certainly issues, some issues for us specifically in the areas of some parts of cameras, audio, video, office equipment. And so you saw some of that impact in Q4, as well as Q1. The good news for us with our platform is we have many, many different sellers. So where we had supply, we continue to offer those for customers. And in cases where we didn't, oftentimes we had third parties that may have had -- still had inventory. So it certainly helped us very well to get through that situation. So those are some of the headwinds that were in Q1. And then we had very strong broad growth amongst many categories, certainly, in terms of the retail categories. And we also had very strong growth in Kindle. Globally, AWS is growing very, very fast. So we had some very, very positive, if you will, tailwinds from the strong growth.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.\nCarlos Kirjner: Two questions, if I may. First, on fulfillment. If you think of the expected authorization of your fulfillment network in the fourth quarter of this year versus what you had in the fourth quarter of '11, do you expect it to be the same, higher or lower? And secondly, on Kindle, now that you are a manufacturer, a seller of Android-based devices, can you comment on your intellectual property position and the strategic and financial risks associated with potential lawsuits from competitors? For example, do you intend to go buy patents in the market?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the first question, in terms of fulfillment utilization, difficult to say at this point what our utilization will be. We have a very good team of people who work on this in each of our geographies, trying to make sure we have adequate capacity throughout the year, as well as for Q4. And it's always a tough balance. We want to make sure that we have enough because we want to make sure we satisfy customers. And so we'll have to see as we progress through the year what the growth looks like. And we certainly -- based on what we're experiencing so far, we expect it to be very good. And we'll have to see what happens in future months and quarters to see what that looks like. So it's a little bit early to say what we think that utilization will be. But we're trying to make sure in any time we do this is to have enough but not too much. And it's a delicate balance, so hard to predict what it will be. In terms of your second question, I don't think there's a lot I can help you with there. We have -- we certainly have a lot of technology that we develop ourselves. And we have a great technical team that's working a lot of different interesting areas on behalf of customers and will continue to do so. Beyond that, there's not a lot I can comment.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Jordan Rohan with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nJordan Rohan: A couple of point of clarification. I don't think I heard you blame macro weakness in Europe. Now clearly, you had stronger results across-the-board, so I don't see it evident in the results. Are you clear enough about the direction of the macro or its impact on your European operations that you can kind of say, at least from what you're seeing, it's not affecting you now? And the second question is on this percentage of third-party versus first-party sales. Last quarter, I believe you said that it got up to 36% in part because of stockouts due to the Thai flood and such. At some point, one would think that the supply chain for cameras and other equipment affected by the Thai flood would normalize. Would we expect that to therefore normalize back down from 39% level back down to the mid-30s? How can we think about that relationship?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the macro economics of Europe specifically, it's -- we're not exactly a bellwether for the economy, and so it's hard to  assess. It certainly is having some impact on us. And you're certainly reading the same press as we are in terms of what's going on, and it's very challenging. But it's hard to quantify what that impact is, so we're certainly having some impact but it's hard to quantify, is how I would explain it. And then in terms of 3P, we have -- we've seen the dynamic that you're talking about in terms of it has helped us with stockouts both in Q4 and Q1 for sure and has helped growth. Where does it moderate? Hard to say. But we have seen outside of these 2 quarters, very good third-party growth. And that's been accelerating over the past couple years in terms of third-party unit growth. There's a number of different factors in terms of making that experience better for sellers. The most notable one is Fulfilled by Amazon. And so that's certainly having an impact in all the geographies that we operate and have that in. And so it's great for sellers, it's great for customers and it's great for shareowners. So it's a nice intersection there. So we're very excited about it, and that's really what's driving it. The stockouts and things, those will happen from time to time in various categories. And I think that's certainly one of the benefits of our model of having both first-party and third-party offerings. But I wouldn't view that as the substantial driver of what's happened in third party over the last few years. It's other things that we've done to improve that experience for sellers.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.\nLloyd Walmsley: Just had a couple questions around AmazonSupply. And I guess, first, wondering if this is the beginning of a bigger push into the B2B kind of industrial space. And then secondly, what do you all see as your strongest assets as you approach this space? Are you planning to rely a lot on third party for inventory? And then just finally, along those lines, the press release mentions the extension of corporate credit. Wondering how integral this might be to the strategy. And then just more broadly, how do you think about credit extension to customers?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the AmazonSupply, it's an interesting -- we've been serving businesses for some time. This is just again a separate URL to help us do that with some interesting selection, we think, on behalf of businesses. We work very closely with a lot of businesses today, both as a customer on our consumer side of our business. We also obviously have a lot of third-party sellers that we work with as part of our seller business. So we're very excited about that. In terms of any -- in terms of extension of credit and everything, those are things that we're working through. And we want to make the right decisions on behalf of those customers. And I can't add much to that today. But certainly we can talk more about that in the future as that evolves.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.\nAnthony J. DiClemente: On the Kiva acquisition, I was wondering if you could talk about how you're planning on implementing that at your fulfillment centers. And does it require much incremental investment? And then more broadly about mobile purchasing behavior, wondering if you could speak to just the purchasing behavior you're seeing from your consumers in terms of what's the order of magnitude and what type of mix shift in buying that you're seeing from PC and mobile? That would be great.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of Kiva, it's early. We haven't closed it yet. And so we're very, very excited to be having Kiva and the team as part of the Amazon team. We're extremely excited to have that. And in terms of implementations within Amazon, we still have a lot of work to do to figure out how and when we'll do that. And so those are things that we'll be working on. But we're very, very excited about the opportunity to join with Kiva. So we're excited about it. In terms of mobile, not a lot I can help you with there. Certainly, the mobile part of our business is growing very, very fast. And it's a very exciting opportunity. And this is not something that's new; it's something that we've been working on for a number of years in a number of geographies. And we'll continue to work on that experience to make it even better for customers over time.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nA. Justin Post: First question is on taxes. Can you help us at all understand what percent of your marketplaces currently pay taxes similar to, say, offline retail? And maybe any help on what you saw on New York with the tax law changes there. Maybe start with that, and then one follow-up.\nThomas J. Szkutak: I'm sorry. Could you repeat the first part of the question?\nA. Justin Post: Yes. What percent of your market, including International markets, are already on what we call level-tax basis, meaning the taxes are the same for buying on Amazon versus an offline retailer?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes. So you're saying sales tax.\nA. Justin Post: Yes, sales tax, yes.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Assume that approximately 50% of our sales, we either collect a sales tax or a value-added tax. So we collect it in several states today in the U.S. and a large number of geographies outside of the U.S. And so it's approximately 50%. So this is not anything new. This is something that we've been doing for a long period of time. And we have very good businesses in those geographies and states that we collect.\nA. Justin Post: And did you see any slowdown in states where they've enacted sales taxes in your sales levels?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes. I can't comment on any specific geography or state. But again, you can see by the growth that we've experienced over the past few years, which includes during those past few years, certainly adding some geographies, if you will, to our collection efforts. And so those are all represented in the results that you've seen over the past few years and several years. So that's all I can add to that.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Herman Leung with Susquehanna Financial Group.\nHerman Leung: Two quick questions. First, I know there's a lot of investment going on in the data center areas for your Web Services business. I was wondering at the current level, I mean, what -- how much capacity you're able to support, especially as you're signing on more of these larger type customers on the government side? And I have a quick follow-up.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes. No, we're ready for additional demand. The team has worked extremely hard to make sure that we keep up with demand. And so as you've seen over the past few years now, you're seeing our CapEx growing. As a result of it, you're seeing the operating expense as it relates to that in our technology and content. And so the team has done a very nice job in terms of adding capacity and is very excited to continue this fast growth that we're experiencing in AWS. So we're very happy to do that.\nHerman Leung: And just a very quick follow-up. I guess, on your -- the GMV that's flowing through your third-party business, is there an opportunity over time to kind of share with us the real power of the third -- just the third-party volume that's actually flowing through the top line?\nThomas J. Szkutak: We have -- the best way to think about it, at least from our -- as it relates to our retail and third-party business, they're not -- it's certainly not a 1-for-1 because you have new and used products. You have different category mix. But in terms of an overall volume perspective, as I mentioned in some of the earlier comments, that it was about 30 -- approximately 39% of our total units, so it's very meaningful. And that's growing -- grew over 60% this quarter, again, up from 36% of our total units. So again, it's -- I can't give you the GMV. But in terms of units as it relates to our retail units, it's 39% of total units, so it's meaningful.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.\nBenjamin A. Schachter: Given the success of the ad-supported Kindle, should we expect more devices to be offered with an ad-supported option? And then also if any comments on the dynamics driving the increase in the shipping revenue. And finally, any update on the share buyback?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes. In terms of what we do going forward, we certainly have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we would do going forward, so you have to stay tuned on that. In terms of the share repurchase, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we purchased 5.3 million shares, just under $1 billion, $960 million during the quarter. We have a little over $700 million or just under $800 million left on our authorization that we have from the board, which was $2 billion, that we got some ago. So that's left on the authorization.\nOperator: And we'll take our last question from Colin Sebastian with R.W. Baird.\nGregor Schauer: This is Gregor Schauer in for Colin. I have a question regarding the Kindle Fire, which you guys have noted for the quarter is still the #1 bestselling and most gifted product on Amazon.com. But it's still only selling in the U.S. Can you help us think through or understand sort of what are the other considerations in terms of the timing of an international rollout of the Kindle Fire?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I really can't. I think you'd have to stay tuned. It's certainly a very interesting opportunity for us. And we know that, and you'll have to stay tuned.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."}], "2014": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-11-06 18:49:04", "content": "Executives: Cindy McCann - Vice President, Investor Relations John Mackey - Co-Chief Executive Officer Walter Robb - Co-Chief Executive Officer A.C.

All lines are currently in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Cindy McCann, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nCindy McCann: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today\u2019s call are John Mackey and Walter Robb, Co-Chief Executive Officers; A.C. Gallo, President; Glenda Flanagan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Sud, Executive Vice President of Growth & Development; and David Lannon and Ken Meyer, Executive Vice Presidents of Operations. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions discussed today. This may be due to variety of factors, including the risks outlined in our company\u2019s most recently filed Forms 10-Q and 10-K. Please note, our press release and scripted remarks are available on our website. We assume you have read our press release. So we will use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter and year as well as our future outlook. Please note, last fiscal year was 53 weeks with the extra week falling in Q4. Our comments today will reflect results on a comparative 12-week and 52-week basis. We also want to remind investors that our average week of sales and gross profit as a percentage of sales are typically highest in Q2 and Q3 and lowest in Q4 due to seasonally slower sales during the summer months. I will now turn the call over to John Mackey. \nJohn Mackey: Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered record fourth quarter results including 12 store openings, average weekly sales per store of $694,000 translating to sales per gross square foot of $947, gross margin of 35.6%, direct store expenses of 25.4% of sales, a store contribution profit of 10.3%, operating margin of 6.4%, EBITDA margin of 9.2% and a return on invested capital of 14%. We\u2019re pleased with our better than expected financial leverage particularly given that cost while still reflecting market share gains were in line of our expectations. Following third quarters of consistent one and two year result averaging approximately 7% and 16% respectively our comps increased 5.9% or 14.5% on a two year basis. This change in trends beyond the 45 basis points contributed to our team member double discount day in Q3 were seen in both transaction count and basket size and was broad-based across geographies, department\u2019s and storage [ph] classes. While we cannot definitively say what drove the change we know that several factors including strategic price matching, cannibalization, competition and currency had a larger negative impact on certain regions in Q4. For example at the end of Q3 we made a significant round of strategic price matches which initially impact our sales but which we believe will drive sales growth over the long term. In addition we have opened six new stores in Boston this year including five in the fourth quarter. Exciting innovation such as the greenhouse on the roof supplying produce to our Lynnfield Store have completely revitalized our brand and what is one of our oldest markets. It doesn\u2019t get more local than that. These stores impact our existing stores initially but as we typically experience sheer drive, healthy comps for the region next year. On a broad level inflation continues to moderate and we\u2019re not immune to the larger macro-environment. As several retailers are reporting discretionary spending has been impacted as consumer confidence has dropped to a six month low. While the current uncertainty in the economy might be impacting our ability to attract new crossover customers at the same rate our core customers appear to be fairly resilient. Year-over-year we have continued to see shifts towards organic products and discretionary categories as well as meaningful increases in $50 plus sized baskets. In addition our new stores are continuing to perform very well and exceed our expectations. For the last eight quarters on average our new store class have consisted of 28 stores opened for approximately 6.5 months, the 36,000 square feet in size they have produced average weekly sales of $515,000 translating the sales per square foot of $738 and have generated a contribution margin of approximately 5%. As you know we evaluate potential new sites on an EVA basis allowing us to consider wide variety of markets from Savannah Georgia to look for New York. While we would expect different levels of sales productivity and operating expenses when balanced with the appropriate levels of capital investment, we\u2019re able to produce healthy returns for our shareholders which is our ultimate financial goal. For the last eight quarters our comparable stores less than two years old have produced an average 15% return on invested capital and we believe this is the best metric for your investors to focus on. We remain committed to expanding our value offerings across the store, increasing our promotional activity and improving our relative price positioning and with our latest round of strategic price matches we have significantly closed the gap against the major competitor. Our sales momentum and operating disciplines along with moderating inflation helps generate record gross margin performance for Q4 with occupancy leverage, shrink reduction and buy site initiatives more than offsetting the impact of our value initiatives. We have narrowed the price gap versus our competitors on known value items to it's narrowest margin yet while continuing to raise the bar even higher on our standards of transparency. We\u2019re the first and only U.S. public food retailer to commit to labeling GMOs and we recently announced the new rating system for fresh produce in floral [ph] that will measure performance on important sustainable farming topics including pest management, farm worker welfare and pollinator protection. In summary, fiscal year 2013 was yet another record breaking year on many levels. Our sales approached $13 billion translating the sales per growth square foot of $973. We opened 32 new stores expanding into 10 new markets and increasing our ending square footage 8% to 13.8 million. We improved operating margin 48 basis points to 6.8% generated over $1.2 billion in EBITDA and exceeded our initial split adjusted EPS guidance of $1.42 to $1.44 by growing earnings per share of 19% year-over-year to $1.47. Our outstanding financial performance generated over $1 billion in operating cash flow and $472 million in free cash flow. We returned $508 million in dividends to our shareholders, repurchased $125 million of common stock and ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash and investments. We remain well-positioned to internally fund our accelerated new store growth while maintaining a healthy cash balance and reflecting confidence in our future growth and cash flow generation. Today, we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share and an additional $500 million in stock repurchase authorization bringing our total available authority to $800 million. Turning now to our revised outlook for fiscal year 2014. For the first five weeks of Q1, comparable store sales increased 5.8% roughly in line with our Q4 results. Based on recent trends, we believe it is prudent to take a more conservative point of view on our sales and earnings outlook for the year. For fiscal year 2014, we now expect sales growth of 11% to 13%, comparable store sales growth of 5.5% to 7%, identical store sales growth of 5% to 6.5%, and diluted earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.69, an increase of 12% to 15%. Please see the guidance table of our press release for additional detail. While resetting expectations is always difficult, we want to underscore that we have just delivered our fourth consecutive year of increases in new store openings while producing improvements in our operating margin and higher returns on invested capital. And our outlook for fiscal year 2014 reflects the continuation of these trends. Each week over 7 million customers visit our 367 stores in 40 states and three countries. In 2005, it was a major milestone for us to report that we had six stores averaging $1 million in sales per week. We now have over 50 stores achieving that level. Yes, food retailing is more competitive than ever and with the growing demand for fresh healthy foods, it seems like everyone is adding to or expanding their offering of natural and organic products. However, we believe the strength of these numbers highlights our ability to innovate and to compete the unique power of our brand and the excitement our stores create within this community. With 47 new leases signed over the last 12 months, we have 94 stores in our development pipeline and see demand for 1,000 Whole Foods market stores in the United States alone. We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. The call will end at 4.30 Central Time. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. \nCharles Grom - Sterne Agee: Thanks. Good evening. Just I was wondering if you could quantify the level on price investments that you made and were they broad based by category and by region? And I suppose what prompted the actions and were they one-time in nature or do you think they will be recurring in 2014? Thank you. \nWalter Robb: Hey, Chuck, this is Walter. We have been talking for a number of quarters about our continuous effort here to continue to make these investments over time where we felt and they are being strategic and being surgical. This was at the end of Q3 was a particular round of them, Cindy [ph], but that was more broad based across a few categories to address a couple of competitors in particular and some of those efforts continue in Q4. And as we mentioned in the script, there is a short-term effect of those even as we think the long-term puts us in the right position. So that\u2019s the answer on that particular item. \nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nKaren Short - Deutsche Bank: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Walter, I think at a recent conference commented that the customer reaction of price investments was faster than it\u2019s ever been. So I guess I was wondering it doesn\u2019t appear that you saw that quicker reaction in terms of positive reaction into the fourth quarter, so maybe a little color on that? And then I guess it just seems that competitive environment shouldn\u2019t really change dramatically from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in my view, I mean, it\u2019s always been competitive, but anymore color on that would be helpful. \nWalter Robb: What I actually said was that I still think that\u2019s true for price investments in general but as I said in the area of produce for example perhaps you can see the response have been quicker, people are noticing in that area in particularly the change is more quickly. So I was pretty specific about individual areas of the store where that was true but we\u2019re still gathering the data and the impact from those investments across the Board as sort of be able to draw those sorts of conclusions. \nJohn Mackey: We listed several reasons or several speculative reasons of why our comp store sales were down just a bit in Q4 besides price and investments we talked about cannibalization. Some of the markets were heavily cannibalized such as Boston. We talked about of course competition. We also think there could be macro-environmental impacts here I think, we think the economy is falling down a little bit. So at the end of the day of course we never really know exactly what makes comps go up and what makes comps go down and we make our best guesses that we can and now. Next question please. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclay's. Please go ahead. \nMeredith Adler - Barclay's: You did a really good job of offsetting the impact of those gross margin of those price investments in the gross margin and I think you mentioned specifically shrink and some improvements in procurement. Can you talk a little bit about you know if there is a 100% opportunity, how far along are you in realizing that opportunity, in blustering and procurement? \nDavid Lannon: On the shrink thing I would say we\u2019re definitely in the middle innings, we see some great improvements, we\u2019re able to offset more than all of our margin investment on prices through shrink reduction. So Ken and I both firmly believe we at least have another year plus of a long runway of improvement in shrink control and that\u2019s definitely helping us maneuver in terms of prices. \nMeredith Adler - Barclay's: And procurement? \nA.C. Gallo: There is as we grow there is definitely opportunities in procurement especially on the distribution side, be able to consistently leverage our distribution but we have the distribution centers in each one of our regions that handle mainly our perishables and as we have been able to, as we grow and able to put more throughput to these they are all facilities that can handle you know our growth, we don\u2019t have to build them out you know devising expansion here or there but it pretty much can our growth so as we grow what we\u2019re seeing is that we\u2019re driving the cost per case of all of our perishables to go through these facilities down and it's really helping us in that area. You know it's interesting when we look at that because of the way we look at things, we\u2019re always looking to get improvements in cost but we\u2019re also looking to make improvements in quality and then standards. So sometimes you know we will take the ability as we grow to actually improve the quality or the standard in certain areas like for instance right now we\u2019re looking at in a lot of our categories we\u2019re looking at the possibility of offering more non-GMO offerings for our customers. So we will view sometimes to our increased buying power to actually improve or raise the standard for our customer without raising the price. So sometimes you get those investments as well which we think over the long term gives us the real competitive advantage, it continues to differentiate us from our competitors. \nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nMark Wiltamuth - Jefferies: I wanted to ask about the buyback, is there any buyback built into your guidance numbers and could you give us that cash and investment level again at the end of the quarter? \nGlenda Flanagan: There is no buyback reflected in our guidance and it was 1.4 billion at the end of the quarter, we follow an opportunistic strategic with respect to buybacks. We don\u2019t expect that to change. \nMark Wiltamuth - Jefferies: And how much of the $300 million that was already authorized has been used up? \nGlenda Flanagan: None. \nMark Wiltamuth - Jefferies: Okay, thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nKelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets: Hi, this is Kelly Bania. Thanks for taking my question. Curious back on the gross margin, which you talked about, but did still come in a lot stronger than expected, does that make you think about managing gross margin a little tighter next year to try to reinvigorate the same-store sales trends or do you feel like there is any change in the elasticity of your ability to drive comps with lower prices? \nJohn Mackey: It\u2019s a fair question, but if you drill into the numbers here on the quarter, you see that if you drill into the gross margin line, the cost of goods sold was actually up reflecting the income on these sort of price investments offset as David and Ken shared with the efforts around shrink and buy side rebates, which really accounts for most of the overt [ph] on the gross margin, in fact, all of the overt [ph] on the gross margin this year. So the trend line to think about is we are trying to balance this \u2013 balance these parts investments with continuing to grow sales and we continue to feel very strong about the potential gross sales over the long-term. And so we are accelerating our square footage opening new stores. And so that\u2019s really if you dig into the number, that\u2019s what you find when you drill into the specifics of that number. So we think it does reflect that we are continuing to step up the investments with a view towards growing the sales. And so could you fine tune it if they actually could, but that\u2019s the art of the retail we are trying to practice each and every day. \nDavid Lannon: Yes, with, this is David, our regional presence we have great confidence in their ability to deliver these margins, our operating regions and that\u2019s giving us the ability to continue kind of our aggressive promotional strategy, one day sales, three-day sales just more aggressive promotional strategy, because we know it can deliver those margins. \nJohn Mackey: Thank you. Next question? \nOperator: Thank you. We will go next to Kate Wendt from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nKate Wendt - Wells Fargo: Yes, thanks. Looking at this quarter, you mentioned that you have made some changes to the holiday catering program this year, then that you have potential driver. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s different versus last year? And then how do you like to manage that from an inventory standpoint if it ends up being more successful than you thought? \nDavid Lannon: We made several changes in terms of how the customer experiences the order guide and we have already seen significant sales higher than last year. And it\u2019s really about how a customer interacts with that and how the region sort of being able to customize it for their needs. And so the interface, the ability for (indiscernible) is the big improvement and then it\u2019s already showing that our numbers are much higher across all regions right now on e-commerce sales amount. \nJohn Mackey: And if I could add one thing just for the first time I know we have got some standardized offer across the whole company that we never had before. So there is \u2013 we are moving together in ways that we haven\u2019t done historically, which is quite exciting. \nDavid Lannon: Also significantly less clicks to place the order this year and last year. \nJohn Mackey: Alright, yes, that\u2019s right. \nKate Wendt - Wells Fargo: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Mark Miller with William Blair. Please go ahead. \nMark Miller - William Blair: Good afternoon. I know most of the focus is going to be on short-term trends, but I am going to do the counterintuitive thing and ask a long-term question. John, I would like to hear your vision for the home delivery in the U.S. and whether you expect it to be a significant competitive dynamic or not and you anticipated to be a material part of your business, the questions for the whole team? Thanks. \nJohn Mackey: I am going to let Walter handle that question. \nWalter Robb: I think, our vision Mark is core, what we are calling, extended experience. It\u2019s the idea that ultimately a retailer integrates the digital world, the physical world and the space between this, the retailer that wins. And I am not sure right now that our first priority \u2013 I am quite sure our first priority is not the last mile delivery, there is others out there. We are doing some experiments right now. We have one with approval right now, where we are partnering with us to accomplish that. We are learning a lot from those tests. We have tests in click and collect going on in two different markets right now. We are giving some opportunities for this space between the store and the digital world. We have a lot going on that we are unfortunately not in a position to talk about right now, but \u2013 so I don\u2019t see the last mile delivery is our \u2013 I do think it\u2019s even in the UK, which is significantly more developed than United States, it\u2019s only 5% or 6% share after significant more developments. So I think it\u2019s growing incrementally, but I think the majority of business ultimately even 5, 10 years are still done in physical stores or in the integrated sense either through the mobile platform or the click and collect sort of model. \nMark Miller - William Blair: But you don\u2019t think others will deliver this service to your customers and represent a meaningful competitive challenge, you just don\u2019t see that coming? \nWalter Robb: I see it. I do see those entrepreneurs and the startups and all those, it is as well some established companies who are providing those services. I do think that continues to grow incrementally, yes, but I think that you know we\u2019re going to continue to develop options as long as either through a robust development of our mobile platform and/or click and collect to get customers options either at our stores or at drop points or by partnering with some of these companies who will be able to work with us, take our products and do the delivery. I\u2019m just simply saying in terms of us actually being the delivers I\u2019m not sure I see that as something that we need to do right now. We haven't see a business model that really works. A lot of people have tried in this area and I haven't seen anybody come up with a business model that is profitable and successful. So we\u2019re going to continue to study it and we\u2019re going to do some experiments and we\u2019re going to continue to innovate but we think we have a really good business model right now that works really well and we\u2019re going to do most of our attention and capital to continuing to do what we think we do really well which is open great new stores that are innovative and give great experiences to customers. We don\u2019t think, when we look at our long term vision we don\u2019t see the world significantly moving in the food area in this direction. Yes there will be some incremental move. It will overtime grow but we do not think food is going to be (indiscernible) to the same degree that some other categories have been that\u2019s our vision. \nOperator: Thank you. We will move next to (indiscernible). Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: I notice that you took up your annual guidance slightly on preopening expenses and relocation cost and I think on the last call you gave some quarterly color on preopening expenses for Q4 and just wondering if you can give any update for the current quarter? \nWalter Robb: Yeah it's going up because we\u2019re growing on faster, we\u2019re opening a lot more stores than we have ever before. \nGlenda Flanagan: And we just have greater visibility now into what\u2019s going to open in 2014 and so we tweak the number as we usually do from then until now we do not give preopening guidance specifically before and certainly not about the quarter. \nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. \nJoe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group: I wanted to get a better understanding of is the cannibalization that you may or may not be seeing and is that something that maybe causing some of the pressure you know as you started to get into I know it's only 300 stores but as you know it's lot more than you used to have, is that starting to weigh on comps? Are stores eating into one another in local communities? \nJohn Mackey: I\u2019m the foresight of accelerating our growth and we\u2019re opening more stores than we have ever before that means temporarily there is a little of cannibalization but what we found historically with no stores anniversary a year later that both stores comp well. So, there is a little bit more cannibalization because we\u2019re growing faster and it's one of the factors. We have listed several factors, there is greater competition there is more cannibalization, we have made in price investments and we\u2019re seeing some weakness we think on the macro level and there could be factors that we haven't been able to identify yet. But cannibalization is I mean it depends on the market, like we singled our Boston. Boston is definitely being cannibalized right now. We have opened up five new stores in the fourth quarter alone. So that market really did feel it but that\u2019s a temporary effect. I mean a year from now the fourth quarter in Boston is going to be fantastic as we will be comparing against weaker numbers and so it's a very temporary thing and certain select markets. However we\u2019re opening stores in new markets, we have barely scratched the surface of what we think is possible since we think we can do at least a 1000 stores in one state. But from time to time we will have some cannibalization impacts that will be temporary, this is one of those times. \nGlenda Flanagan: It's also unusual for us to open that many stores in a new market in such a short period of time. \nDavid Lannon: Opportunistic opportunity to with the Johnnie's Foodmaster stores. So we\u2019re able to get into markets between our existing stores. So we are able increase our market share much higher in Boston. \nWalter Robb: And I am the fourth person on this question, but well this is a no excuse company. And I think the bigger picture is \u2013 this is as John said is one of the things that we are offering is kind of the explanation on the short-term numbers, but we are putting a lot of chips down to grow this company aggressively. We have got our square footage growth is stepping up to 8.5%. We have got the numbers the raw numbers are more than we have never done before. Occasionally, it will come into some markets, where we have some stores, but the bigger picture here is we are on our way to a thousand store goals in the United States and we are very confident about that. \nJohn Mackey: On the flip side, we have our 32 stores that we opened last year, 10 of them were in new markets and eight of the 15 leases that we \u2013 14 leases that we signed this quarter were in new markets. So there is plenty of runaway, plenty of opportunity that is untapped for us. \nWalter Robb: Thanks for the question. \nJoe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group: It\u2019s great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. It appears we have reached the end of our call for today. I will turn it back to Mr. Mackey for closing remarks. \nJohn Mackey: Okay, thanks for listening in.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Ms. Cindy McCann, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nCindy McCann: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On today\u2019s call are John Mackey and Walter Robb, Co-Chief Executive Officers, A.C. Gallo, President, Jim Sud, Executive Vice President of Growth & Development and David Lannon and Ken Meyer, Executive Vice Presidents of Operations. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions discussed today. This may be due to a variety of factors, including the risks outlined in our company\u2019s most recently filed Form 10-K. Please note, our press release and scripted remarks are available on our website. We assume you have read our press release. So we will use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter as well as our future outlook. All references to shares outstanding and per share amounts are adjusted to reflect our two-for-one stock split on May 29. I will now turn the call over to Walter Robb.\nWalter Robb: Thank you, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to deliver another outstanding quarter. We produced a 20% increase in earnings per share on a 12% increase in sales, once again reporting a record or near record results on many levels, including average weekly sales per store of $728,000, translating to sales per gross square foot of $996, gross margin of 36.6%, store contribution of 11%, operating margin of 7.5%, EBITDA margin of 10% and a return on invested capital of 16.5%. Our solid performance and capital discipline generated $228 million in operating cash flow. We invested $115 million in new and existing stores resulting in $133 million in free cash flow. In addition, we repurchased $25 million of stock and returned $37 million in dividends to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $384 million in share repurchase authority. Our sales trends have remained consistent over the last three quarters. For Q3, excluding an estimated 45 BP, a positive impact from our Team Member Appreciation Double Discount Day, our identical store sales increased 6.7%, or 15.3% on a two-year basis. The increase was driven by an approximate 4% increase in transaction count and a 3% increase in basket size. Our sales momentum and operating disciplines along with moderating inflation, helped generate another quarter of record gross margin performance. We remain committed to expanding our value offerings across the store, increasing our promotional activity and improving our relative price positioning. We continue to be very competitive in non-perishables with more opportunities to narrow the gap in perishables which reflect our higher quality standards. This quarter, our value efforts were more than offset by occupancy leverage, shrink reduction and buy side initiatives. In addition, cost of goods sold was positively impacted 19 basis points by a decrease in wholesale revenue related to our meat procurement program. Excluding this, our gross margin was 36.4%, in line with the second quarter. Direct store expenses increased 27 basis points to 25.6% of sales. Excluding the negative impact of the decrease in wholesale revenue and increase in team member discount costs related to our Double Discount Day, our direct store expenses as a percentage of sales were in line with our Q2 results of 25.4%. Store contribution was 11% of sales, in line with our record Q2 results. We opened four stores this quarter, expanding into three new markets. We are able to enter markets as diverse as suburban Danbury, Connecticut to urban Detroit, Michigan by tailoring our store size, product selection and pricing strategy to the particular community. In Detroit, we implemented a new value strategy in our perishable areas that has been very well received. We are opening a similar store in New Orleans later this year and we think that there's opportunities to duplicate elements of this value strategy for perishables in select markets across the country. Our new stores are continuing to deliver very healthy returns. For the last eight quarters, on average, our new store class has consisted of 26 stores open for approximately six months. At 37,000 square feet in size, they have produced average weekly sales of $528,000, translating to sales per gross square foot of $745 and generated a 5% contribution margin. These results, combined with our capital investment and pre-opening expense discipline, enabled us to deliver another quarter of high return on invested capital. For the quarter, our 25 comparable stores less than two years old produced an after-tax ROIC of 19%, another Q3 record. Check out the beyond the numbers section of our investor relations webpage for additional information about our new stores and more. Turning now to our updated outlook for the fiscal year and initial outlook for fiscal '14. Based on our strong Q3 results and our updated assumptions for the fourth quarter, we have raised our fiscal 2013 diluted EPS outlook by $0.01 to $0.02. Our new fiscal year EPS range of $1.45 to $1.46 implies EPS of $0.30 to $0.31 for the Q4. As we typically do at this point in the year, we are also narrowing our fiscal year ranges for comps and idents based on our year-to-date results. Our idents for the first three weeks of Q4 are 5.5%, which we attribute primarily to a tough comparison of 9.5% in the prior year. Our guidance for the quarter is 6.5% to 7%, or 14.8% to 15.3% on a two-year basis. This guidance reflects an expected acceleration in idents over the last nine weeks of Q4, as our year ago comparison eases 150 basis points to 8%. The high end of the two year range is consistent with our Q3 results excluding the positive impact from our Double Discount Day. Regarding gross margin, our long-term strategy remains in place. We are continuing to implement various value efforts, including more aggressive price matching against select competitors. We have been successful at offsetting these efforts thus far, but are not expecting the same degree of leverage in Q4. We also want to remind investors that our average weekly sales and gross profit as a percentage of sales are typically highest in the second and third quarters and lowest in the fourth quarter due to seasonally slower sales during the summer months. On a 12-week to 12-week basis, we expect operating income before pre-opening to increase a healthy 16% to 20% in Q4. We expect a record 12 new store openings versus seven last year, as well as a high number of openings in Q1 of next year, to drive a significant year-over-over increase in pre-opening expense and lower EPS growth of 7% to 11% compared to the 20% we produced year-to-date. Our initial outlook for fiscal year 2014 reflects another great year of consistent sales growth, record new store openings and strong operational performance. We expect sales growth of 12% to 14%, comps of 6.5% to 8%, idents of 6% to 7.5% and an EPS growth of 17% to 18%. This is an exciting time for our company. We are dedicated to providing communities with fresh, healthy, natural and organic food and are on track to deliver our fourth consecutive year of increases in new store openings. We continue to gain market share and see demand for 1,000 Whole Foods Market stores in the U.S. alone. Our outstanding operational performance is funding our growth and our new stores are creating a cycle of innovation across the company. We have signed 50 new leases over the last 12 months and now have 94 signed leases, nearly a three-year supply of new stores, in the pipeline. We expect accelerating square footage growth for several years to come. Each week, over seven million customers visit our 355 stores in 40 states and three countries. We are confident we can maintain our leadership position and continue to gain market share as we step up our new store openings, improve our relative value proposition, further differentiate our shopping experience and reinforce our standing as America's healthiest grocery store. We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will end at 4:30 Central Time. Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs: Maybe can you just address the new store productivity. On our calculations it looks like it was a little bit softer in the quarter. Just wondering if there is something unusual there in terms of timing. Then, second, if there is a reason to follow-up, I will.\nWalter Robb: Why do you think it was softer? Stephen? I don\u2019t understand the question. Where do you see the softness?\nStephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs: Just saying in the current quarter on our calculations it looks like it was a little bit softer than where it had been trending. More like the 60% range rather it had been more consistently in the 75% to 80% range?\nWalter Robb: We don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\nCindy McCann: Well, I do. Hi, this is Cindy. The way we are reporting the results for new stores is on a rolling eight quarter average now and we have seen very consistently strong trends in our average weekly sales, sales per square foot and store contribution which are driving really strong ROIPs. So we don\u2019t see any big changes in trends. The reason we started doing that rolling eight quarter average was to try to even out or smooth out any fluctuations that you can sometimes get on just one quarter basis. So I am assuming you are looking at the sales productivity on just one quarter basis. Is that right?\nStephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs: Correct. That\u2019s correct.\nWalter Robb: Just a little bit of color here. See, and I just have to say, one of the real bright lights here is, the performance of the new stores out the gate, they have consistently been performing, generating good sales per square foot and as you can see, the 5% contribution number are pretty good for the 26 stores. So our take on the view on this end is that it's really a strong positive.\nStephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs: No, I mean that\u2019s great to hear. I appreciate the color there. I guess, as another follow-up, just changing gears. You referenced the diversity in the store sites and locations. Can you maybe talk about how the model has maybe been changed or altering as you move into these more unique locations?\nKen Meyer: Hi, this is Ken. I think one of the things with the new store growth is that every store is different and that it reflects the community really well. So the size depends on what we are able to get in the marketplace. It is also what fits for the community. So a variation of no two stores are the same. So they vary quite a bit and are very reflective of each community that we go into.\nDavid Lannon: This is David. Our Boston market, we are opening up the Johnnie's Foodmaster that we acquired last year will go from 8,000 growth line all the way up to close to 50,000 in Melrose and we are opening those stores every two weeks for the balance of the summer. So those are all locations that were are supermarket. So we are just taking their sites and turning them into Whole Foods.\nWalter Robb: We don't really have different models. I mean, we don't have like some retailers have like what they have their small, medium or large size model. I mean, we really get the store and so it's really going to sit right into the community and we are very flexible. We can do small stores as David said, as small as 8,000 square feet and we can do big stores 60,000 plus, and we continue to look for all those different opportunities and we thinking going forward, you are going to see a very wide range of stores. Now, some quarters may look like we are opening up smaller stores. It's just kind of how they fall, but on average our stores has still been average up there close to 40,000 square feet when you put them all together. I think part of being able to get to that thousand just add flexibility to take on these different opportunities.\nDavid Lannon: Well, regardless of the size of the store, they all have to pass our five-year EVA hurdle in the real estate, so we have evaluate each store based on the competition in the marketplace we are in and we just had real estate meeting yesterday and I think we approved eight new sites and directed one, so we have our disciplines in place and I think it's paying off. Our new store performance is so much better today than it was just a few years ago and seems to be getting all the time. That's why we were all confused why you are saying it seem to be soft. From our perspective, we've never done better with new store openings. Thanks a lot, Stephen.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the side of Jason DeRise with UBS. Your line is open.\nJason DeRise - UBS: Jason DeRise at UBS. I wanted to ask about two things somewhat together. It was better than consensus expecting gross margins, but then I think when you back out some of the adjustments for the quarter maybe the sales were a little bit wide, so I wanted you to maybe talk about that it's maybe you are taking a little bit more on pricing and that's driving the gross margins up and does that explain why maybe sequentially through the quarter things slowed axe the Double Discount Day and ex-the of July 4 shift?\nDavid Lannon: I think they were wide based on our guidance?\nCindy McCann: Jason are you referring to the first three weeks versus the last nine-week?\nJason DeRise - UBS: Yes. I mean, I guess what I am saying, yes. Exactly, so if you forget that 200 basis points benefit for the first three weeks, you say 7% for the IDs.\nCindy McCann: Correct.\nJason DeRise - UBS: I mean, you guys reported a number that included the 45 basis points benefit, but also I guess if you could quantify the July 4 shift I think that would help people, but even when I tried to back in to that it just seems like there was a deceleration it's for quarter an underlying basis? I mean, if you could share any color on that. The second part of it's really the gross margins were better. Are they two tied together in some way?\nCindy McCann: The numbers are actually consistent. I want to reiterate that 200-basis point impact on the three weeks is only a 45 basis tax for the quarter.\nJason DeRise - UBS: Right. That makes sense.\nCindy McCann: ID was 7% for the first three weeks, which is a 15.2% on a two-year basis, excluding the Team Member Double Discount Day for those first three weeks and that's totally in line with the two-year and the last nine weeks.\nJason DeRise - UBS: Okay. So you guys are looking at more on the two-year and that's what your\u2026\nDavid Lannon: You got to look at the two-year, because you got tougher comparisons, so you can never ignore that. We think that our results were pretty consistent with what we've been doing and we've reiterated our guidance for Q4, so we [people] would forget too much into the first three weeks when we are going up against a difficult comparison. I mean, if you look at Whole Foods Market's long-term track record for both comps and idents. I mean, it's amazingly consistently really other than the economic downturn, it's been amazingly consistent and so we feel really confident right now.\nWalter Robb: Just to read through, we've you just we are reaffirming the guidance for the quarter, which is 6.5% to 7%, which is again probably consistent one-year and a two-year basis. And, with respect to your question on gross margin, if you axe out those one-timers, you are back at 36.4%, which is very consistent with Q2, so I am not sure I understand your question there, but again it looks to us like we are steady she goes, pretty consistent here quarter-to-quarter.\nJason DeRise - UBS: Okay. If I can ask one more on the gross margin, obviously there is that comment about 34% to 35% long-term, but still not seeing pressure here. So, I guess, do we need to think about a new range for long-term gross margin? Are you able to get your price points down? And grow your gross margin long-term?\nWalter Robb: I feel like I have become the boy crying wolf. We really are making price investments. So far, we were never been able to offset on the buy side plus really get better shrink control than we have had but as we are working through our plan going forward, we will begin to see some of these price investments maybe nipping gross margins a little bit but hopefully helping our COGS up through the strategic decisions that we think will produce, in the long-term, greater profits for our shareholders. So we haven\u2019t seen that in gross profits yet, but I think that we will probably begin to see that some point. That\u2019s why I said, I feel like I have become the boy crying wolf because I have been saying that for a few quarters and so far it hasn\u2019t happened yet, but I feel certain it is going to happen.\nDavid Lannon: This is David. Just a little more color. Ken and I are working on the shrink discipline and huge with all the stores in the region. We just let a new Addison store in Dallas and we embedded them with refrigerated doors for almost all of our produce in that store. So not only is that energy reduction but it is also shrink reduction. So we are starting to see those disciplines across all stores and if some, there is a lot of money to be saved. So we think, for this year, we have been able to offset any price investments by shrink control.\nWalter Robb: Yes, I mean it is an art of balance not a scientific balance. But one other interesting number was the days on hand with the 16.5 which is our best result so far in terms of really managing inventory and you put that with these operating disciplines of shrink control, inventory management, or helping to balance and as is often said, it is an art, not a science. So this is where we are right now.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). We will now move to the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nKen Goldman - JPMorgan: Can you update us on the pace of competition that you are seeing? Whether it's accelerating at all? Just an update because some of you larger, more traditional competitors have talked about accelerating their investment in organic and natural and there is obviously an IPO coming of one of your competitors out there too. So, just curious if you are seeing the space heat up in terms of competition or whether it has always been competitive and nothing has really changed?\nDavid Lannon: We don\u2019t think we have any new competitors. The same people we have been facing for years, possibly because Whole Foods has done so well and our market cap is so high, we are seeing a lot of people raise money, get valuation, more people going public and so there will probably be more capital thrown into the business to be sure. But we continue to gain market share. We just keep rolling along. As you can see, our results here, record EBITDA, record returns on investment capital, our growth has never been this rapid before, in terms of DAPs per unit we are opening and signing. In fact, arguably this is best Whole Foods has ever done in our 34 year history. So great success breeds competition. So I expect that we will see more competition but, again, we have first mover advantages. We are also innovating at a very rapid rate. So it\u2019s the nature of capitalism and I like where Whole Foods is positioned right now.\nWalter Robb: This is Walter. I would just say, we love competition. It makes us better. We get to respond and innovate and grow. So bring it on. I think the ultimate answer here is that, in the marketplace that we are now seeing, we are saying we will the chips on and investing more dollars to grow the company faster than we ever have. If you look at 12 new stores in this quarter, Jim's team has done a fabulous job getting us close to another hundred leases in our pipeline. We are saying, we are betting that we can continue to grow in this marketplace that you describe. So it's robust, its' dynamic. That's always been so. But I think we feel good about our chances going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from the side of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Mushkin - Wolfe Research: What I wanted to discuss actually, I think came up on the last conference call regarding maybe the pendulum swing a little bit too much towards not just smaller stores, but maybe more downscale stores and I was on a beach for a while and had a chance to walk (inaudible) at you guys stores and I did come across a few that I would say, maybe went that direction. So I guess my question is, a, do you think maybe it did go a little too far there and the stores aren\u2019t differentiated enough and that you need to swing the pendulum back a little bit, and as you swing it back, if you agree with that, how do you control the cost as make that switch. As the economy is different and things have changed since the great recession? Thank you.\nJohn Mackey: What exactly you are talking about?\nScott Mushkin - Wolfe Research: What specific stores, John.\nJohn Mackey: Yes. The ones that you feel are down scale or too down scale. I am just curious.\nScott Mushkin - Wolfe Research: I mean, I wouldn't say down scale while putting quotes, I would say, Katy, Texas to more in Iowa to be specific.\nJohn Mackey: That's a new word. Isn't it? Down scale I don't ever heard as well.\nWalter Robb: You mean the markets, the stores themselves or the fact that those are markets that are sort of new markets for us? Meaning that whether stores looked and showed up?\nScott Mushkin - Wolfe Research: I mean, I think, I would put quotes around it. Because, I think you guys do is naturally [had] down scale I think comparison to some of the other stores. It seemed that the core package was a little different than I would normally would see with Whole Foods, and I was just wondering. Maybe this doesn't makes sense, but that's kind of what my impression at least.\nWalter Robb: I'll make a general comment then Dave and Ken can give you some color on that, but I mean, I think you know again part of this is the right size store for the right community and the for example I am very familiar with that one. It's sort of a 30,000. We took that over from our boarders one of those outlets and so I think the business model there was fairly straight forward and projections and so forth. I think we are kind of working way into that one, but I have been through that store. It's fairly straightforward, but do you guys want to add some color to Katy?\nKen Meyer: You want to get on the plane with us go visit some stores, we could show you some exciting stores all over the country, but I think It'd be pretty envious if you saw our [deal] and the move to morning for example, but come to (Inaudible), we just opened a new store up in (Inaudible) in Southern California. We got airstream inside the store. That's our bar inside the store, very exciting punched up in that store. If you didn't like Katy might try going to Edison, Dallas, I think lots of inflation, lot of excitement there. The re-low from our old Richardson store. The store is doing tremendous sale and if all those stores that you cited are doing very well.\nDavid Lannon: I don't think there's any effort to say we are going to lower the bar. I think, there is a minimum bar. If you are going to do Whole Foods Market is going to be at a certain level than I think then from the store gets bigger as volume gets higher, you are going to see some different programs.\nKen Meyer: You put different things in different stores. Like we said, we try to design a store to the community and what we think people in that community will really want and support and you are going to have some of our stores that just get lots more new innovation and different things than other stores, which we built fairly straightforward and we only have 30,000 square foot store like West Des Moines. There's only so much you put in there, you have to pretty much keep the basic as you got to be able to get all the basic items in there. You are not going to see some of the innovative concepts including in-store restaurants and sit down eating areas and all that stuff you are not going to have there like you have in some of the larger 60,000 square foot stores that we put in some area.\nDavid Lannon: Make sure you get to our Brooklyn store, which opens about probably in November or maybe early December. I think you will agree. That won't be a down scale store. That being said, you know us well enough to know that since we've heard your comments, we are going to check in all these, so thanks for the feedback.\nScott Mushkin - Wolfe Research: Thank you, guys. I mean, you've done a marvelous job of controlling expenses and they are actually phenomenal.\nDavid Lannon: Thanks a lot. Appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go now to the side of Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nShane Higgins - Deutsche Bank: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I just want to drill down on the composition of the comp or the traffic and ticket. I think, Walter, in your prepared remarks you noted that traffic was about 4%, and I believe you guys were cycling this up 7% last year, so that traffic remains a pretty positive element of your story and I think that's a step up from the second quarter and I just wanted to get your thoughts on that if that was a reflection of the price investments you are making, maybe the moderating inflation, I think weather was an impact last quarter. Any color you can give on that and then on the composition of the ticket too. Thanks.\nWalter Robb: Thanks. I think it's a slight positive up from the Q2, and I think that the 60-40 is our historical range. We are back in that now the 4% is a nice number. As you know, we are coming out of recession. We were punching up sort of almost close to 80% ticket basket and we've normalized back to the 60-40, but we have seen a little bit of an increase in three from two and I think you've got that exactly right. Your other question was around the basket. Do you guys want to comment on the basket? It's all about the average price, really. Do you want to comment on the basket composition at all? What we are seeing on units or pricing on anything there?\nDavid Lannon: Well, I think in the third quarter we have done a really good job of being clear about how we market price and being very surgical about we price and where we want to put the value, where we want to make investments and that\u2019s definitely showing up in how the basket composition has changed. Also the various one-day deals and weekend deals that we have, that\u2019s affected as well and that isn\u2019t consistent year-over-year, it varies with what we have available to us and what we promote at the time. So that all factors in how the basket evolves.\nWalter Robb: Are we getting extra question?\nShane Higgins - Deutsche Bank: Yes, I think so. That\u2019s helpful. Are you guys pulling into new shoppers you think as well? You mentioned the promotions that you guys have been running. Do you think that\u2019s also attracting people outside your core loyal customers?\nDavid Lannon: Yes, we are (inaudible) by the trade. This is David. As the Detroit experience, again, it hasn\u2019t been a core demographic of Whole Foods Market. So, we are thrilled and our stores are doing at least double of what we expected it to do, and its off to a tremendous start and it has super diverse customer base. Again, we think that gives us great confidence to go into markets we haven\u2019t been or people haven\u2019t thought at as traditional for Whole Foods Market at best.\nWalter Robb: I think the other thing you mentioned is, I don\u2019t know if you noticed but our social media presence is almost 3 million and 4 million twitter. We are number two brand on Twitter and I think that allows us to bridge into a new generation of customers who are digital natives and it creates us another exciting platform for us to reach people. So, yes I do think we are generating new customers. I would like to be able to give you a more scientific answer on that but just that sort platform, that sort of ability to reach people is really helping us.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our final question today from Robert Ohmes with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRobert Ohmes - Bank of America: I just had a follow-up question on the comment about, I think Walter you might have made it on more aggressive price matching against select competitors. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about whether that is more targeted towards natural organic competitors or the traditional groceries? Also, is it pretty regionalized or is it broad by category or is it targeted to the produce category? Maybe just a little more color about that more aggressive price matching that you guys are doing now. Thanks.\nKen Meyer: This is Ken here. I think what we are looking at with pricing is, it depends upon the market. We look at primary competitors. So it could be a traditional or conventional compared, it could be a natural food competitor, it could be a rising competitor that\u2019s new into the marketplace. So it very depends upon who we see as the folks that we want to compete against and price against and so we study that. We look at how we want to match up, what categories are we going to look at, what the (inaudible) are going to look and so it\u2019s a very comprehensive process that varies, even store-to-store, but market-to-market and we feel really good that the data that we have and the methodology which we are using now is stronger than ever. It (inaudible) about our position to promote differently and merchandise the stores differently based on value. Want to speak some more?\nDavid Lannon: And we also, (inaudible), our data team is at a point now where we such good information that we do a lot of experiments that\u2019s just really exciting. So we can try a lot of different pricing initiatives against different types of competitors, again in different marketplaces with different products and see what happens. See what kind of elasticity there is in terms of the pricing versus pickup in sales and see what the customers really want. So we are doing a lot of that kind of experimenting and it's a whole new area for us. It is not something that we have really had the types of data and the team that we worked on before. Some of the (inaudible) data really have been spearheading. I find it very exciting.\nKen Meyer: Our team members are very proud of our prices. We don\u2019t have to be ashamed compared to any other competitors (inaudible) because we have prices and we are proud to show you about it and show it in our stores.\nWalter Robb: Okay, great. Thanks everyone for the questions. Thanks for listening in. Please join us in early November for the fourth quarter earnings call. A transcript of the scripted portion of this call along with a recording of the call is now available on our website. Thanks very much. Talk to everybody next quarter. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you, and this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at any time.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2013 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead sir.\nSean Boyle: Hello and welcome to our Q2 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 25, 2013 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thanks Sean. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 41% to $4.53 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 76% to $265 million. Trailing-12 month capital expenditures were $4.27 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in the fourth quarter 2012. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology, infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital was 2%, down from 11%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 474 million shares compared with 468 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $15.7 billion or 25% excluding the $392 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rate. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $4.4 billion, up 7% or 11% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.42 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%.Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer accounts exceeded 215 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units. Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.21 billion, or 71.4% of revenue, compared with 73.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $4.09 billion, or 26% of sales, up approximately 275 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.76 billion, or 11.2% of revenue compared with 10.1%. Tech and content was $1.43 billion, or 9.1% of revenue, compared with 7.6%. Marketing was $651 million, or 4.1% of revenue consistent with prior period. Now, let\u2019s talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 30% to $9.49 billion. Media revenue grew 16% to $2.17 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $6.48 billion, representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 67%. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $409 million, a 4.3% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 13% to $6.21 billion. Adjusting for the $391 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue decreased 1% to $2.22 billion, or grew 7% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 22% to $3.94 billion, or 29% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 63% of international revenues, up from 59%. International segment operating income was zero, down from $16 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income increased to 11%. CSOI increased 14% to $409 million, or 2.6% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 19%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 26% to $79 million, or 0.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $13 million. GAAP net loss was $7 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared with net income of $7 million and $0.01 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.49 billion year-over-year to $7.46 billion. Inventory increased 24% to $5.42 billion and inventory turns were 9.4, down from 10.1 turns a year-ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 27% to $8.99 billion and accounts payable days increased to 73 from 68 in the prior-year. I\u2019ll conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high-level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we\u2019ve described in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q3, 2013 we expect net sales of between $15.45 billion and $17.15 billion, a growth between 12% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $440 million and $65 million compared to $28 million in the third quarter of 2012. This includes approximately $340 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million loss and $275 million in income compared to $232 million of income in third quarter 2012. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let\u2019s move to questions.\nSean Boyle: Great. Thanks Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Sandler - Deutsche Bank: Thanks, guys. Just have one question on shipping. It looks like the unit efficiency in shipping continues to improve, what are you guys doing to drive the cost of shipping each unit lower? Are there more cost that can be taken out on a per unit basis? And then as you start looking at same day delivery in some of these markets, including the new grocery program, what incremental costs do you see around doing same day fulfillment? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the economics, we have great team, operations team that\u2019s working on how do we serve customers reliably and faster. So that \u2013 certainly that\u2019s reflected in our transportation costs. Also from a productivity standpoint, we just as we add capacity, which is getting closer and closer to customers with larger selection which is certainly helpful from a productivity standpoint. So, those are some of the dynamics that you need to think about, when you think about our transportation cost and the teams done a great job over the years of becoming even more reliable, faster, and more productive and again that we working on ways to make that it better over time.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll move to Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping if you could talk a little bit more just on the profitability of the grocery business and how you\u2019ll know when is the right time to expand to more markets beyond Seattle and LA? And then also if you could comment on the European macro environment, just given the growth that you saw in the international business just decelerating a little bit from last quarter? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the, the fresh business, we started doing the pilot several years ago in Seattle. We did a number of \u2013 team has done a great job, inventing on behalf of customers, it\u2019s a very good customer experience. The challenging that we\u2019ve had over the past several years is to how to make it economically viable. And so that\u2019s the team has done a lot of different experiments and invented well on behalf of customers that to see what works. And we took a lot of that knowledge and which enabled us to launch fresh in LA. And it\u2019s very early there, we\u2019re still in the trial period, its good customer experience and we like what we see so far, but it\u2019s very, very early. And so, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to work on and both from a customer experience and from an economic standpoint. And there is not much more I can add to that right now, so you have to stay tuned and see where that ends up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Miller from William Blair.\nMark Miller - William Blair & Company: Hi. Good afternoon. Could you help us understand the third-party unit growth? I think this is the first quarter in about three years that third-party unit penetration hasn\u2019t increased. And then, additionally I wonder if you could comment at all on potential to expand prime membership options, potentially it is something like a super prime offering for expanded video content and fulfillment options?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the third-party unit growth, it was 40% this quarter, which compares to 40% last year in Q2. So again, it is flat as a percentage of total units. One thing we keep in mind though is our digital units are growing at a faster rate than physical. And those digital units are primarily first party units. So if you take out digital units out in both periods, we\u2019re actually up approximately 300 basis points. So, physical seller business is growing very nicely. It\u2019s going at a faster rate than retail and its doing very well and so, very pleased to see that.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll move now to Brian Pitz from Jefferies.\nBrian Pitz - Jefferies & Company: Great. Thanks. Quick question on fulfillment centers, any color on your current plan for the year in terms of locations, U.S. versus international, timing etcetera. And then separately any comments on the weaker growth in international media? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of FCs we\u2019ve announced to-date five net new facilities in the U.S. We\u2019ve also announced some in international, its still early as we did in prior \u2013 last few years, we gave you updates kind of as we went along and so we can update you a little bit later in the year to see how that progresses. But we certainly are adding new capacity and that\u2019s reflected in the guidance which you see in Q3 as we get ready for our Q4 seasonal quarter. In terms of growth, in international media, what you\u2019re seeing there is on a local currency growth basis, you see a 7% growth. That\u2019s consistent with what you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters. We are at the very early stages, we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re seeing so far in digital. But we\u2019re in that early stage of transformation from digital from physical to digital within international. And so, you see from the release that we\u2019ve launched a lot of new things related to digital over the past 90 days and even prior to that. So, we\u2019re very excited about those launches and excited about the transformation. We are also excited, if you look at our total international business, we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities to invest in. I talked about the conversion from physical to digital. We also have selection still to add within existing categories, new categories, new geographies, so we\u2019re very excited about the opportunity that we\u2019ve there.\nBrian Pitz - Jefferies & Company: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now go to Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.\nScott Devitt - Morgan Stanley: Hi. Thanks. I guess, the International topic again, but it has been asked a few times. So maybe specifically in China, Tom, in terms of what the Company hypothesis is in terms of the way that market plays out over time and how you think about investment spend in that market. And then secondly, as it relates to AWS, it\u2019s nice, the event \u2013 the annual event and the quarterly events that happened, I was wondering when you think it makes sense to start talking more about it in releases and on calls? Is it just the 10% revenue threshold or something else that would lead to more discussions on that, on calls like this? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of China, we\u2019re investing heavily in China. And we have \u2013 we\u2019ve been for some number of years. We\u2019ve a good customer experience there. We continue to look at ways to make that even better. We\u2019re adding selection across many categories right now. It\u2019s a very interesting geography. And so, we will continue to work on that experience for customers. You should expect us to be in investment mode for some time and, but it\u2019s a very sizable segment, very interesting long-term growth opportunity and we\u2019ll continue to work on making that better for customers and for investors over time. In terms of AWS, the business is growing very, very strongly. We\u2019ve got a great team that\u2019s innovating on behalf of customers, launching the services, becoming more productive, which allows us to be able to lower prices. We\u2019ve had many price reductions since we started with AWS and we share that very visibly and so we\u2019re excited about that business. And even though we were off to a very good start, it\u2019s a very big opportunity and we continue to invest in that business and we\u2019re very excited to do it. We think its great long-term opportunity and we\u2019ve great team working on it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thanks. Tom just one question related to consumer packaged goods. Any comments there on whether you\u2019re seeing broader purchases by the Amazon customers of more traditional consumer staples than you've seen in the past and is that something that you\u2019re trying to promote? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes. We \u2013 just to make sure I heard your question, we\u2019re seeing \u2013 when you look at our for example, our North America growth, particularly EGM, we\u2019re seeing very good growth across many different categories. But if you call out, we\u2019re seeing very good growth in apparel specifically, and also consumables. And so, the teams has done a very nice job, both teams done a very nice job from a customer experience standpoint and they\u2019re growing very nicely and that is something that we\u2019re seeing, and it does help with frequency to the site as well.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll now go to Mark May from Citi.\nMark May - Citi: Thanks for taking my question. Another one on international in the media segment there, I believe that you now have a more comprehensive, kind of localized international strategy for the Kindle. And I wonder if you could talk about what, if any, impact that you think that that might have over the next few quarters in terms of its impact on the international media segment? And also on international, the AWS, I think one of the contributors of growth and we suspect margins in the U.S. has been the success of AWS here. I wonder if you could talk about any plans for AWS outside the U.S.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of Kindle, you\u2019re right. We now have Kindle stores, if you will, established in all the Amazon domains that we\u2019ve around the world. And recently we announced Kindle Fire HD, its available customers in over 170 countries. We introduced Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Fire HD in China, both -- that\u2019s both online on our website and also in a number of offline retail locations. So again, there is a lot of advancement in terms of the Kindle, but again, it\u2019s very early. Very encouraged by the opportunity that we have there for customers and our ability to try to capitalize on that from a digital content standpoint. In terms of AWS, the business is expanding, and its incredible opportunity globally. We recognize that, the team recognizes that. And we\u2019ll continue to work on that on behalf of customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch: Thank you. The Company and the business is going through a lot of transitions with digital media, AWS, obviously Prime and potentially same-day delivery. Long time ago, you used to give us kind of a margin outlook for the Company. As you these businesses, do you think that they\u2019re better for Amazon and that you can have greater share of retail as these evolutions happen. And then also, what are the implications on Amazon\u2019s long-term margins as you go through these transitions over time? Any help on that could help. Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure, in terms of the way we\u2019re looking at I\u2019m certainly it is based on the free cash flow potential, and we have a -- we\u2019re in some really interesting great businesses that have a lot of potential from a free cash flow generation standpoint with good and high ROICs which is exciting. From a margin standpoint always challenging to predict where that will come out in terms of absolute numbers. But what we will do is, we want to make sure that we try to maximize free cash flow, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve always said. So, our strategy hasn\u2019t changed, our outlook hasn\u2019t changed in that regard. Frequently we\u2019d be asked historically is, double-digit operating margins are possible. And I still think it's possible, but also if it means if a good high single-digit operating margin gets us to better, higher free cash flow over time, that\u2019s fine too. So, again our goal is to, we don\u2019t focus on individual margins. Our goal is to make sure that we generate free cash flow, large monthly free cash flow and use that capital efficiently, and so those are goals that we have and we certainly think that opportunity is there in each of the business that we operate in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie.\nBenjamin Schachter - Macquarie Securities Group: Two quick questions on revenue recognition, over the past some quarters I believe that the certain digital media at least has moved around between the agency and wholesale model. Can you help us quantify how this has actually impacted the reported media revenue rates in other words would 2Q revenue rates have been meaningfully different if the model had been the same. And then the second question, just quickly on Prime, can you remind us how you recognized revenue from the Prime memberships deal over the course of the year? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the Prime we recognized it over the life of the subscription. And then in terms of third party versus first party certainly we have had some shift within digital media, but again digital media is primarily a first party business, and it happens to be one portion of our business. But you\u2019re actually right, and in terms of our third party business which from a unit perspective is 40% of our total units this quarter. We recognized the share of that revenue, the rev share if you will ad revenue where as the other parts of the business largely were recognized in that as first party revenue, and so we\u2019re recognized in the full amount of the revenue in the current period.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Rohan from Stifel, Nicolaus.\nJordan Rohan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company: Thank you so much. I\u2019m curious about your expansion efforts in Spain since it's a relatively new territory for you, how well situated you are and how ready you are for the fourth quarter there. And also, there have been a lot of stories about Amazon heading into Brazil, but I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve identified any fulfillment centers and things like that. Can you discuss the extent and breadth of your offering in Brazil whether it's Kindle devices, digital media or something beyond that? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of Spain, we\u2019re very excited about what we see. It's growing very fast. We\u2019re in investment mode and it's an exciting geography for us, and we\u2019re very optimistic over time it will be a great geography for us. So we\u2019re very happy to serve customers in Spain and we\u2019re continuing to -- as we\u2019ve done in other geographies that we\u2019ll continue to serve customers and continue to expand our selection and get service levels even better over time and so I\u2019m excited about that. In terms of Brazil, we do have a Kindle store and we have devices at physical retailers. So, from a Kindle perspective that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in Brazil.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Josey from JMP Securities.\nRonald Josey - JMP Securities: Great, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about North America EGM. Just given the strength you saw on the business and continued reacceleration, have you seen any sort of impact I\u2019m assuming no, but from price matching programs from offline retailers, and we\u2019ll talk -- and also sale tax. Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of North America, total growth we saw an acceleration from last quarter from 26% to 30%. We saw an acceleration in both North American Media as well as North America EGM. Within EGM it was very broad. In terms of growth we saw a very strong growth across many different categories and so very pleased with that, I called out a couple, that were notable in terms of apparel as well as in consumables, certainly those are getting larger and still growing very fast which I call those out. In terms of competitiveness, it's been, it's very competitive, it is today, it has been since our inception. We have many different competitors online. We have many competitors offline. As you go to your home or office you pass our competitors every day. That\u2019s an environment where we\u2019re used to dealing in. It\u2019s something that\u2019s not new. It's something that we see in all of our geographies across many different categories.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you Tom. As you get closer to customers with more FCs and more efficient shipping, what kind of impact is that having on conversion rates, on within customers in those areas as shipping time shorten or delivery time shorten. And then as you look at the early adopters for Fresh in LA any sense that you can share with us of what kind of cross shopping you\u2019re seeing among new Fresh customers, are they bundling media in EGM in those other orders or to any degree are these new Amazon \u2013 new to Amazon customers that have been brought in purely because of Fresh?\nThomas J. Szkutak: If you take a look at LA, it's just again I\u2019m very excited and it's very early. So, I think on that one you\u2019ll just have to stay tuned. But in terms of, as we get closer and closer to customers with fulfillment, we have seen growth due to that and it\u2019s manifested its way \u2013 in a few different ways, but notably you\u2019ll see it in Prime. Because of our fulfillment logistics capability we\u2019ve been able to offer Prime broadly and we just have selection, it's just closer and closer to customers. And if you look back over the last several years, there\u2019s been different reasons why we\u2019ve grown away, we have grown in terms of adding the selection and making sure that we have really sharp pricing and, but certainly Prime and which includes a speedy delivery certainly been notable, has had a notable impact. And we\u2019re very pleased with the Prime program, customers like it. We\u2019re having -- we see very strong growth in Prime subscribers. We see very good retention of Prime members. So, it's a great program for us and certainly again delivery speed is certainly impacting that program, our overall growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Diclemente from Barclays.\nAnthony Diclemente \u2013 Barclays Capital : Thank you. On the topic of media just wondering Tom if there are any callouts in terms of categories of strength or weakness within physical or digital media that you could call out, and along those lines just wondering if you could comment on your media device rollout strategy from here I there\u2019s anything you can tell us. And then quickly, is there any reason PrimeInstant Video isn\u2019t available for Android devices? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of media growth not a lot of callouts except probably the obvious is digital units growing very fast relative to physical units and we\u2019re excited to see that. And because of where we are, we\u2019re further penetrated in North America, you\u2019re seeing a bigger impact in our growth rate than you are in international and we certainly see that but not a lot of other callouts there, but again we\u2019re very pleased and certainly customers are responding to many things including selection and great prices and everything else within those digital offerings, but also they\u2019re responding to unique selection that we have. And if you take a look at our release you\u2019ll see the specific numbers related to some of the exclusions we have, and certainly that\u2019s having an impact. So there\u2019s many, many different things that are working for us in that space as part of our overall ecosystem for digital that we\u2019re pleased with. In terms of our device plan, we\u2019re very pleased with the devices we have and to offer customers we think we have a great offering both in terms of Kindle and Kindle Fire. And in terms of our future roadmap, we\u2019ve a long standing practice of not talking about what that will be prior to announcement.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.\nYoussef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald: Thank you very much, two quick questions please. Tech and contents was up to 9% of revenues, I think that\u2019s the highest it's ever been. How much of that is actually streaming content related and how do we look at it going forward, does it stay at that elevated level? And then on Fresh, is that business profitable for you in the Seattle area? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of tech and content we\u2019re spending in a number of different areas, but there\u2019s a few that I\u2019d like to highlight. One is certainly keep in mind that the infrastructure related to our very fast growing web services business is included in tech and content, so certainly as we ramp up that business and it's becoming more sizable and growing very fast you\u2019re seeing that impacting that line item. We\u2019re also investing very heavily in digital and that\u2019s across many different parts of our digital offerings there, that\u2019s also included. Any of the tech teams they\u2019re working on customer experience across Amazon as we grow so as we support both our seller businesses and our retail businesses, they\u2019re included in that line item. So, certainly that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing there. In terms of Fresh we\u2019re not breaking out the financials but keep in mind that Fresh was designed as a pilot and certainly the economics that improved over time through invention on behalf of the team there as well as operating efficiency. So, again that was set up as a test and which has enabled us to launch LA.\nOperator: We will now go to Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird.\nColin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird: Thanks very much. I guess a quick follow up on the device strategy and given the fairly quick pace of innovation in the tablet market overall. I wonder if you can contrast the benefits of that for Amazon given the popularity of shopping in media apps with the cost and complexity of maintaining your own line of hardware, and related to this it seems as if the pace of new content acquisition on licensing has picked up a bit and so I wonder if that reflects any changes in either the competitive dynamics or pricing or is some sort of other strategy shift on your part? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of some of the dynamics, we\u2019re very excited about our digital business. We\u2019re inventing, you\u2019ll see a lot of different inventions both on the hardware side as well as on the software side from a device standpoint. You\u2019ll also see a lot of invention around the content side and we think for example PrimeInstant Video which combines video in our Prime membership is very compelling, and we\u2019re investing heavily in content. It's still very early there but we\u2019re finding that customer\u2019s certainly existing Prime members are more and more streaming content. We\u2019re having new Prime members come to Amazon largely because of video in terms of one segment of that population that\u2019s coming, the new Prime members is because of PrimeInstant Video and we can see that based on the free trials and the conversion of those free trials from related to PrimeInstant Video and so that\u2019s certainly one portion of our growth in Prime memberships which we find exciting. For us to be able to offer exclusive content on the book side is very interesting. So, again we\u2019re investing a lot of different -- across a lot of different areas and yes there are a lot of different dynamics, but we think we\u2019re well suited for both the device software and content side of those businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities.\nMatthew Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities: Good afternoon, just two questions. One, given your comments that international will be in investment mode for some time. Can you just remind us what the priorities are there from either a geography or a product standpoint. And then secondly following the management changes at Quidsi, I would love an update on the plans for that business and maybe just a sense for how integrated it is to Amazon Retail? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yeah, in terms of the international piece what I was referring to was an investment move, sometime I was referring to China specifically and we have a lot of opportunity to grow. We\u2019re still continuing to invest in international, but I would -- my comment was specifically around China. And then your question around Quidsi?\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go to Steven Ju from Credit Suisse.\nSteven Ju - Credit Suisse: Tom, is there \u2026\nThomas J. Szkutak: Hello, just to follow-up I think on the Quidsi question I think was around the founders leaving and we\u2019re well positioned with them leaving, and this is the last part of that. But we did -- we\u2019re fortunate to have the founders with us for a number of years, and they did a great job while they were here. And we have a great team at Quidsi, and we\u2019re pleased with that business and the team -- our retail team works very closely with Quidsi business and we\u2019re excited to have it as part of the Amazon team.\nSteven Ju - Credit Suisse: Tom, is there anything you can share in terms of the situation in Germany with the worker strike\u2019s, are you able to fulfill from an unaffected fulfillment centers or is it causing some invents to your operations there? And also if you could update us on what you\u2019ve been doing with Kiva since you\u2019ve acquired it. Are you focusing on internal integration, are you selling more aggressively through external clients? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of Germany there\u2019s a not a lot I can add to there. We\u2019re certainly serving customers, those results are reflected in our overall total results that you see today for Q2 as well as our international results. In terms of Kiva we certainly -- we gave a great team there, we love the technology. We don\u2019t have any announcements in terms of rollouts, but we\u2019re ahead of schedule from what we had set out at the time of purchase which we\u2019re happy about. So, I\u2019ll have to stay tuned on the actual rollout, but we\u2019re very encouraged by what we see there.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Ken Sena from Evercore Partners.\nKen Sena - Evercore Partners: Hi, thank you. Just going back to your comments on unit acceleration; has the shift from agency to wholesale in terms of the DOJ E-Book Settlement, has that completed or you\u2019re still working your way through many of the U.S. publishers? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: We\u2019re working through it. I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s complete, but we\u2019re working through it.\nSean Boyle: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations\u2019 website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-04-25 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day everyone, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2013 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Mr. Boyle, please go ahead.\nSean Boyle: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2013 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks Sean. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 39% to $4.25 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 85% to $177 million. Trailing-12 month capital expenditures were $4.07 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in the fourth quarter 2012. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology, infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital was 1%, down from 12%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 471 million shares compared with 464 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $16.07 billion or 24% excluding the $302 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rate. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $5.06 billion, up 7% or 10% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.21 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 60%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 30%. Active customer accounts exceeded 209 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units. Now, I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.8 billion, or 73.4% of revenue, compared with 76.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.83 billion, or 23.8% of sales, up approximately 289 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.74 billion, or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.5%. Tech and content was $1.26 billion, or 7.9% of revenue, compared with 6.5%. Marketing was $616 million, or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.6%. Now, let\u2019s talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $9.39 billion. Media revenue grew 14% to $2.51 billion. EGM revenue grew 28% to $6.13 billion, representing 65% of North America revenues, up from 64%. North America segment operating income increased 31% to $457 million, a 4.9% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 16% to $6.68 billion. Adjusting for the $301 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 21%. Media revenue grew 1% to $2.54 billion, or 7% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 28% to $4.09 billion, or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 61% of international revenues, up from 56%. International segment operating loss was $16 million, a 0.2% negative operating margin compared with income of $49 million. CSOI increased 11% to $441 million, or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 27 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 6% to $181 million, or 1.1% of net sales. Our income tax benefit was $18 million it includes $46 million of discrete tax benefits primarily resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit that was enacted in January 2013. GAAP net income was $82 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with $130 million and $0.28 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.18 billion year over year to $7.89 billion. Inventory increased 27% to $5.4 billion and inventory turns were 9.5, down from 10.4 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 29% to $8.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 68 from 62 in the prior year. I will conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumption. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high-level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance, as we\u2019ve described in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q2, 2013 we expect net sales of between $14.5 billion and $16.2 billion, a growth of between 13% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 275 basis points of unfavourable impact on foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $340 million loss and $10 million income compared to $107 million income in the prior year period. This includes approximately $340 million for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and, other operating expense to be between zero and $350 million compared to $360 million in the prior year period. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. With that, Sean, let's move to questions.\nSean Boyle: Great. Thanks Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: Certainly. (Operator Instructions) And our first question today will come from analyst Brian Pitz with Jefferies.\nBrian Pitz: In February, you changed your FBA fulfilment fees. Any comments on how this affected third-party sales and what was the overall merchant response? And then just quickly any update on your latest plans for new fulfilment centers in 2013?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of -- I will take the second part of the question first, in terms of new fulfilment centers, we\u2019ve announced three in the US right now and then a few outside of the US consistent with the prior year. It\u2019s early -- we really like the growth that we are experiencing. We will be adding more of these through the course of the year but stay tuned, we will update you as we go. In terms of FBA, there\u2019s not a lot I can talk to there. We are very pleased with the FBA business and we think it\u2019s great for sellers and great for customers. And we are pleased to offer that service.\nOperator: Moving on, we will hear from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley.\nScott Devitt: Tom, the international segment sales growth of 21% continues to show modest deceleration I think with the exception of 4Q, it\u2019s been trailing US growth. I understand that AWS is mostly booked in the U.S. so that\u2019s a piece of the delta. But you\u2019ve talked in the past quarters about the investments in international driving margin to at least breakeven levels in international. I wonder if you could just talk through deceleration in the revenue growth in those markets and whether that\u2019s comp related Europe macro or otherwise? And then secondly, shipping cost on a net basis is again leveraging. I think that\u2019s a second consecutive quarter. I just wonder if you could refresh us in terms of when the accounting change occurred in terms of the shipping revenue calculation for FPA to just understand if that\u2019s an organic number now. Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: The second half of the question, there is -- it is organic. So there is no -- it\u2019s consistent year-over-year. So this is the first quarter. It will be consistent year-over-year. In terms of your question, international, we\u2019re seeing still very solid growth, 21% on a local currency basis. As you\u2019ve read, certainly there is some softness from a macro standpoint that others are saying are hard to know whether that\u2019s impacting us and how much we\u2019re not a bellwether for the economy. But we\u2019re very pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing. Again 21% on a local currency basis, unit growth is actually growing substantially faster than that. So again that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. In terms of investing, you\u2019re absolutely right. We\u2019re investing in a number of geographies including certainly China. We\u2019ve been investing for several years. We continue to invest there. We think it's a great long-term opportunity but we\u2019re in investment mode. And certainly some of the more recent additions that we\u2019ve had with Italy and Spain are certainly in investment mode as well.\nScott Devitt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Moving on, we will take a question from Mark Mahaney of RBC capital Markets.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. It\u2019s just a broad question on demand that\u2019s kind of mid-teens at the low-end revenue growth that you\u2019ve been, kind of, guiding too for, a quarter or two now that we\u2019ve seen well below the -- the average that you\u2019ve seen in the past. Are there any other factors you would want to call out or specifically not call out? Do you think that things like imposition of state sales tax are having in near-term drag on growth rates. Last quarter, I think you talked about consumer electronics at the high-end. Are there any particular categories there you would want to call out as maybe driving that low -- that could produce low-end of the range outside of negative FX? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. We give -- as we\u2019re consistently doing, we\u2019re giving a wide range. We think it\u2019s appropriate, given all the factors that\u2019s not something new that we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s something that have been doing for some time in your right -- growth rate guidance for Q2 is 13% to 26% certainly foreign exchange having an impact that includes approximately 275 basis points of foreign exchange. So it\u2019s approximately 16% to 29% on a local currency basis. So again it\u2019s a wide range and just probably not a lot to add there but it takes into account all the things that we think we need to take into account as we give guidance. In terms of the absolute dollar range, it\u2019s very similar to what we would have -- in terms of the dollar range we would have given for Q1. I think it\u2019s maybe $100 million difference in terms of the absolute value of that range that we gave. So again wide range, we think that\u2019s appropriate.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Ben Schachter of Macquarie.\nBen Schachter: Are there any factors that are impacting the unit growth, particularly the shift from physical to digital, for instance rented video versus purchasing of video. Are there any other factors that you would highlight that are impacting the unit growth?\nTom Szkutak: The one factor, I would call out, first of all in terms of overall unit growth. Overall unit growth is 30% year-over-year. Again, very solid growth, compares to approximately 49% of Q1 of last year. So it\u2019s certainly -- we\u2019re certainly overlapping a pretty strong growth of last Q1. In terms of the physical and digital, certainly one thing that we\u2019re seeing is certainly digital growing at a much faster rate. And when you do see that, a little bit is in our third-party units as a percentage of total units. You will see that, that\u2019s approximately 40% this quarter. That compares to last year up about approximately 100 basis points. But what we\u2019re seeing is because the digital units are growing at a faster rate and that mostly first party you're seeing that number impacted where that percentage as a percentage of our total is not growing as fast as it has last few quarter. Again that's largely driven by the digital units growth that you are seeing. So again that\u2019s -- if you were to back out, for example, and just look at our physical units, our physical units as a percentage of total units this year versus last year is up over 300 basis points. That\u2019s again 3p growth as a percentage of total units.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Ross Sandler, Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Sandler: Question on the -- follow-up question on the shipping, so just your net shipping costs, not your shipping margin, but just shipping costs relative to gross profit declined about 300 basis points, similar to what you have seen over the past four quarters. So as you start to comp some of these efficiency gains that you are seeing in shipping, do you think that line will continue to show leverage or is it going to start to level out from here?\nTom Szkutak: We are not giving -- certainly we\u2019re not giving guidance on any specific line item but certainly over a long period of time we think there is opportunity to be more productive there, and there are certainly efficiency gains to be had there. And that\u2019s something, certainly the team continues to work on.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird & Company.\nColin Sebastian: Just a question on what services -- wonder if you can comment on enterprise level adoption, whether there are any meaningful barriers to that happening over time. We notice you\u2019ve been pretty aggressive in hiring enterprise-level sales people?\nTom Szkutak: No, I don\u2019t think that there is. I think the team has done a fantastic job in terms of developing services that are great for many different customer types, including enterprises. And the team is heads down focused on making sure we have a great operational of these services that are great from an operational standpoint and security standpoint and they are doing a terrific job. And so it\u2019s a very great opportunity for enterprises to adopt our services and the team is certainly focused on that along with other customers. So other customers that took in, it's a great opportunity for those customers and for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: You\u2019ve clearly been more aggressive in terms of video content recently and you are sort of leading, was it more in the release tonight in terms of the business content. I was hoping you could just add some more color here on the value that you think TV and movie content adds to consumers\u2019 overall purchase patterns?\nTom Szkutak: Sure. It\u2019s certainly one of our digital offerings and we have a number of different services. We have certainly content that we\u2019re using as part of our prime offer that we have a lot of free content of the customers. We think that's a great service to customers along with our express shipping offers as well as other content that we have free, for example, our Kindle owners lending library for books. So again, we think it\u2019s a great -- finds a great value for customers and it\u2019s part of that value proposition. We also have in a very good transaction business for video as well. That\u2019s growing very, very fast and certainly customers like it. We are seeing that reflected in the result that you see today.\nOperator: Moving on, we will hear from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Mr. Post, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.\nJustin Post: Sorry about that. I was on mute. I was wondering if you can help us little bit about the Kindle ecosystem. On prior calls a few years ago, you singled it out as a fast growth area and you were very happy with the performance. We haven't heard as much about it lately. Kind of the impact -- sort of how units are doing against your expectations and then the impact it\u2019s having on prime subs and also your growth in operating margins? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: We are very pleased with Kindle and digital business. And we are superexcited in terms of the ecosystem. You're certainly seeing that in our results that you see today. For example, if you look at our media growth, we are certainly -- that ecosystem is more penetrated there than it is in international and you see that reflected in those associated growth rates. Another way you see it is, if you take a look at our top 10 best-selling items worldwide in Q1. The top 10 are all either digital or Kindle related. Paperweight is our best selling product worldwide. But again, all 10 spots in the Q1 were either Kindle or digital items. And I believe that that's the first time that we\u2019ve seen. We've been looking at that from a quarterly results standpoint for some period of time, and we\u2019ve had various levels of the top 10. But I think this maybe the first quarter we\u2019ve had all top 10 being either Kindle related or digital related. So again, we are very pleased with what we were doing there and we are going to continue to innovate on behalf of customers.\nJustin Post: And any impact on your gross or operating margins you recall?\nTom Szkutak: One thing I would say is we certainly are investing, certainly in area of investment and you're seeing that reflected. We are making a number of investments across the business and certainly we are investing in Kindle and our digital offerings. We are investing in some of the things I mentioned earlier like China or some of the emerging geographies. So those are certainly some of the larger key investments we are making.\nJustin Post: Thank you.\nOperator: Moving on, we will hear from Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities.\nMatt Nemer: Afternoon. We are hearing reports that there is refrigeration equipment going in some of your fulfillment centers outside of Seattle area. Just wondering if you can update us on plans to expand AmazonFresh. Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Nothing to announce here. We are very pleased with what we've seen in the Seattle area. But against, it\u2019s been a test and we continue to monitor that test carefully. It\u2019s certainly something that we see that customers love the experience. The challenge has always been in making sure we get the economics right and that is something we will continued to focus on.\nOperator: And up next, we will take a question from Steven Ju of Credit Suisse.\nSteven Ju: Hey. Tom, anything you can say in terms of how much Amazon has done video as well as potentially your own in-house produced content currently helps and will -- should in the future help reduce churn in Amazon Prime? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks for the question. Yeah. It\u2019s something we haven't released any of the numbers. It\u2019s something that we are tracking very closely. It is something that we believe over time will reduce churn and it\u2019s certainly helping today. What we are seeing is great traction. We see a lot of usage of the service. Customers love it and we think it is very interesting part of Prime offering. And that\u2019s why we have been expanding NYC, some of the more recent announcement including some of the stuff included in the earnings release today around original content So, again, it\u2019s something that we find very interesting and we are excited about it.\nOperator: And we will go next to Ken Sena of Evercore Partners with our next question.\nKen Sena: Hi. I was just hoping you can maybe provide a little more color on the unit growth deceleration. And looking back over the last four quarters, it seems like about 500 basis points or so each quarter of deceleration. You had about 200 basis points here, which is an improvement. But anything you could say just to any signs of maturity in some of the business anywhere that deceleration is specifically coming?\nTom Szkutak: No, there is not a lot I can add. I mean I think the 30% book, very strong growth rate. Again it\u2019s growing at a faster rate than revenue, revenue at 20%, revenue at local currency growth of 24%, a very strong third-party growth continues to be very strong. Retail growth is strong. So again there is not a lot I can provide you there. But again keep in mind that we are overlapping 49% growth last year Q1, which is certainly little bit of a difficult compare but again fees would be 30% growth rate.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from John Blackledge, Cowen & Company.\nJohn Blackledge: Just a question on the Amazon advertising platform, given the immense amount of purchase ad you have on Amazon customers, how is that being used as a competitive advantage and maybe you just provide an overall view on the direction of the Amazon ad platform over time?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the platform itself, we think it's a very sizable, very good long-term opportunity for us. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working on for some time and we think it\u2019s very interesting. One thing you'll notice, on our site we\u2019re being obviously very -- making sure the customer experience is great. What we are really trying to do is we are trying to help customers find and discover what they want to buy online. So we\u2019re and it\u2019s very customer centric but it\u2019s also from a business standpoint of very good long-term opportunity with great team that\u2019s working on the opportunity. And we\u2019re excited about the long term potential of it.\nOperator: Moving on to Anthony Diclemente of Barclays.\nAnthony Diclemente: I am just wondering what you are seeing in terms of the attach rate of your transactional video on demand business versus usage of PrimeInstant Video. I am wondering just if your consumers tend to choose between the two, when they are making the selection or there\u2019s one sort of drives the other, does the Prime subscriber have a higher transactional VOD attach rates than non-Prime? So would be helpful to see -- to hear what you're seeing there in terms of usage?\nTom Szkutak: Yeah, I think the thing that can help with this, we see -- of Prime customers, for example, we certainly see adoption of the service in terms of free content but those same customers are purchasing content as well. So there is a good attachment to it which we like. And we see Prime members doing not just within video content but we see them doing a lot of cross-shopping. So it\u2019s not surprising we see them do, maybe a customer comes in, and had been traditionally purchasing them pre-Prime, in a few categories, we find that they do a lot more cross-shopping. Same thing with digital content. They use the service, they might start with free content and then they will also continue to purchase paid content. So it\u2019s a nice effect that we\u2019re seeing, which is why we like Prime so much.\nOperator: Up next, we will hear from Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald.\nYoussef Squali: Two quick questions please. Going back to the international, a question, what\u2019s going on in the international media to decelerate, I think last year Q1 I think it was up 22%, FX adjusted this quarter was up 7%. Is that all macro or are there any maybe other factors that you can talk about, maybe specific to SKUs or something? And the other is more of a clarification. I know last quarter you gave the unit growth in aggregate versus the unit growth of the retail, just wondering if you could give that to us as well?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the international media growth, this quarter it was 1% on a dollar basis, 7% on a local currency basis, which you -- in terms of the overall growth rate certainly what you\u2019re seeing is digital content as part of that is growing very fast. But it\u2019s not as large or as penetrated. Our ecosystem isn\u2019t as developed I would say as it is in the U.S. And so when you compare the two geographies for second that\u2019s one of the more meaningful differences that you see between the two as you see that both are growing digital content very fast. It is just the ecosystem is more build out in North America. But again, certainly we see very positive signs back in the growth we\u2019re experiencing in international. It\u2019s just on the lower base. So that\u2019s began to be helpful there. In terms of the unit growth, we said that our overall unit growth was 30% for the quarter. Our 3P unit growth I don\u2019t have the overall growth rate but it\u2019s growing at a faster rate than the total.\nOperator: And our next question today will come from Jordan Rohan of Stifel.\nJordan Rohan: Yeah. I was hoping you could comment on the market entry and expansion strategy for Amazon in Brazil. There seemed to be tremendous amount of press last year about it and it seems to have died to some degree. I know the company may already be there with Amazon Web Services and some Kindle offerings. But when do you think that might get a little bit broader? And secondly, there's been some stories recently about an Internet streaming device or box or set-top box, something of those sorts. Can you comment on any new hardware form factors including apps as of some sort of a cell phone or handset that might be coming down the pipe, anything to look forward to in the Kindle family or related? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of geographic expansion, there is not a lot I can say specifically about Brazil. We think we are in the right geographies right now. We\u2019ve expanded into a number of geographies over the past few years. That is certainly something always we look at and you should expect us to expand to additional geographies over time. In terms of any questions related to our product roadmap, we don\u2019t -- we\u2019ve a longstanding practices of not talking about what we might, or might not do there. But we are certainly excited about the product roadmap that we have for the future and again, we\u2019ve a longstanding practice of not giving details until closer at launch.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one final question today. That question will come from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer & Company.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Can you give us a little more color around customer growth? I mean, that number has been slowing not dramatically, but that is a slowing trend. Are you focused more on higher value customers to drive the business and any color around the quarter would be helpful? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: We're actually pleased with the growth from a customer standpoint. We've seen very good growth and we continue to -- we have many, many teams across Amazon that are just heads down focused on trying to improve the customer experience and inventing on behalf of customers. So, we couldn't be more pleased with what they are doing, and you see that reflected in our overall growth rate this quarter with revenue up 24% on a local currency basis and units growing at 30%, on top of strong growth quarter last year Q1.\nJason Helfstein: Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Great.\nSean Boyle: Thank you for joining us on a call today and for your questions. The reply will be available on our investor relations\u2019 website at least to the end of the call. We appreciate your interest at Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}], "2015": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2014, "date": "2015-01-29 21:48:01", "content": "Executives: Phil Hardin - Director of Investor Relations Tom Szkutak - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President Brian Olsavsky - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Global Consumer Business\nAnalysts: Brian Pitz - Jefferies and Company Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley Ron Josey - JMP Securities Kaizad Gotla - JPMorgan Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein Research Mark May - Citigroup Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Eric Sheridan - UBS Investment Research John Blackledge - Cowen and Company Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs Mark Miller - William Blair and Company Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Colin Sebastian - Robert W.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.\nPhil Hardin: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our Chief Financial Officer and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 29, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Phil. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 25% to $6.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased to $1.95 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of the earnings release, we included a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with capital and finance leases. Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 9%, down from 13%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by the average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million one year ago. I will turn the call over to Brian for additional financial highlights.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Tom. Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion or 18% excluding $895 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%. Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year-over-year. EGM revenue increased to $20.64 billion, up 21% or 24% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 70% of worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 53% year-over-year. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than two million. Seller units represented 43% of paid units, Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented more than 40% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded one million. Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of revenue compared with 73.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.62 billion or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.33 billion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 6.6%. Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.3%. Now let's talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 22% to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, representing 72% of North America revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion. North America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.58 billion. Excluding the $872 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion or a decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 10% to $7.11 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%. International segment operating income was $20 million, down from $151 million in prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% to $1.04 billion or 3.5% of revenue, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $591 million compared operating income of $510 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net income of $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Now I will discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 billion or 20%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $55.47 billion and international revenue grew 12% to $33.52 billion or 14%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 9% to $1.81 billion or 10% excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin was 2% compared to 2.7% in the prior-year. GAAP operating income decreased 76% to $178 million. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $4.97 billion year-over-year to $17.42 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $8.30 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior-year. And now back to Tom with guidance.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Brian. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q1 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion or growth of between 6% and 16%. This guidance anticipates approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $450 million loss and $50 million in income, compared to $146 million in income in the first quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between zero and $500 million in income compared to $502 million income in the first quarter of 2014. I will conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our reportable segments. We expect to change our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services, beginning with first quarter of 2015. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. Thanks and with that, Phil, let's move to questions.\nPhil Hardin: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed with your question. Your line is live.\nBrian Pitz: Hello. Can you hear me? Hi, guys. Just a quick question. You had a strong holiday season. 100 million more items shipped for free this holiday, while FBA units was up 50% and fulfillment expense remain relatively flat. How did you manage that? Are the new sortation that was essentially the key to controlling shipping costs? And what percent of units sold are FBA? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the last part of your question, the percentage of FBA units of third-party paid physical units are over 40% and in terms of the fulfillment discussion, certainly Q4 is our most seasonal quarter. You can see that we get a little bit better leverage, I should say, than we have gotten in other quarters. Again, most seasonal quarter. Not a lot to add to that but we continue to ship on behalf of retail offerings as well as FBA that's included in that.\nBrian Pitz: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKatie Huberty: Yes. Thanks. There's a headline on the tape referencing improving productivity in 2015. So I just wondered if you could clarify what areas of the business you are focused on in terms of productivity? And then what are some of the projects or areas that we should be prepared to see a large uptick in investment in 2015?\nTom Szkutak: Yes. I think that you are referring to is, I mentioned on a earlier call, that we do an annual planning process. We actually start it in the late-summer, early fall. We go through that process. We take a break for the seasonal holidays and then we get back to it. We are in the process of finalizing it right now. And the teams are putting even more energy and attention on driving what we would call fixed expense and variable expense productivity as well as other efficiency projects. So there's many, many different pieces that go into that. But certainly we have added a lot of people and structure over the last several years. And so we have been putting folks on that. But we are just putting even more folks on it as we finalize our plans for 2015.\nKatie Huberty: And what areas should we expect big upticks in investment in 2015?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of investment, certainly we are going to continue to support the growth of the business. You should expect that we will be spending more in terms of CapEx to support our web services business which is growing very fast. You should expect us to add fulfillment capacity, as we have done in prior years. We have updated you a bit as we have gone along and so we will do that from time-to-time during the year as well in 2015. So stay tuned on that.\nKatie Huberty: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed you are your question.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Real quickly on fulfillment cost. It looks like the overall cost is already quite a bit, around 17% growth in 4Q from 30% in 3Q. I am wondering if anything specific led to that improved overall growth from, is it maybe the key of a rollout? And then quickly, I think there was mentioning around breaking out AWS results. Wondering if any reason now? Perhaps it's getting to a level that you have to do it? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Yes. In terms of the fulfillment piece, it's not a lot of callouts on that. We had unit growth of 20% year-over-year. Certainly our FBA is growing at a faster rate. The sellers were up 65% over years who did 40% of our units. And again, the team continues to work on getting productivity there. In terms of AWS, we just think it's an appropriate way to look at our business for 2015. And so our plan is to separating it out as of Q1 of this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nKaizad Gotla: Thanks. This is Kaizad Gotla, in for Doug. I think you noted Prime is growing faster internationally than it is in North America. So can you help us reconcile that with the difference between your North America and international EGM growth rates?\nTom Szkutak: If you take a look, what I mentioned was, Prime, worldwide is up 53% year-over-year. so it's growing very fast globally. It's 50% growth in the U.S. and even higher in international. And so the reason both are contributing to the growth rates that you are seeing. But we are certainly at a earlier stage in international. So it's an opportunity for us, but in terms of the number of Prime members relative to the U.S. is smaller. So it's an earlier phase. So again, as we continue to grow that, it's an opportunity for us and certainly something that we are focused on.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nCarlos Kirjner: Hi. I have two questions. Can you comment on your view of the relative value proposition of Prime in European markets and Japan? Is it similar to the U.S.? Two-day shipping and all the other benefits? Or is it different? Because we think, for example, that penetration of Prime in the European markets is much lower and you have told us that the number of Prime SKUs is much lower in the U.K., for example. So what's the fundamental cause of that? Why is it that Prime in the U.K. is not as developed as in the U.S.? Is it timing or is it the proposition? The second question is about AWS. You have a leadership position now and it's a very large market and it's easy to see from the outside that you are hiring aggressively, both in engineering and sales. Given the size of the opportunity and your position, what specifically prevents you from hiring faster, developing more products, investing more? How do you balance? What prevents you from doing that? Why wouldn't you invest twice or three times as much in AWS? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of, I will take the AWS one first, we are expanding very rapidly. We have been hiring a lot of great people over the past few years and several years. We do think it's a big opportunity. We are making sure we keep the hiring bar really high to make sure we bring in great resources like we do across all of Amazon and we are super excited about the opportunity. So we are investing very heavily. You see that certainly in our CapEx numbers and the assets we are acquiring with some of the capital leases you see that represented. So again we are investing very heavily, both in terms of people as well as capital for that business and we share your excitement about the business. In terms of from the Prime piece, the proposition is a bit different by geography and we continue to make it better in all the geographies that we have Prime. That's something that we are focused. The shipping speed is different by geography a bit, but the focus is all about how we make sure that we get a great experience for customers in those geographies. But the one thing is different is, you mentioned is that, the proposition or the timing. So the proposition is a little bit different, but we will continue to work on making it better for all the geographies we have it in. But the timing is different. We did launch in the U.S. first. And then we launch in other geographies following that. So as a result, it's just earlier in these other geographies. So we still think it's a very good opportunity and something that we are focused on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark May with Citigroup.\nMark May: Thanks for taking my question. One on, I am sorry if I missed this, what's your thought or outlook for pricing in the AWS Cloud business for this year? It was obviously quite fierce last year. Do you think it will be quite as competitive in 2015? And then in the media business, we have been hearing data points about a slowdown in the eBook space. Are you seeing that? And what's your outlook? Do you see any hope for the media segment to improve as a result of that? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the first question, we have continued to lower prices for customers in web services. Certainly that's something that we have been focused on. Since early launch, it's something we continue to focus on. It's hard to predict what will happen going forward. So I really can't comment on what we might or might not do there. But certainly it's something that we had, since launch, we have had many, many, it's in the high 40s, I think, in terms of pricing actions there. So we are very excited to make sure that we have great prices for customers. In terms of the media, you are seeing an overall media growth globally. You are seeing some softness in the growth rate there. I just want to point out certainly one of the larger factors or largest factor that's in that number is, keep in mind that we have video game consoles that are part of the media growth numbers or the media absolute numbers. And last year it was a very strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is, when you have those launches, you also have video games that are -- the video game sales themselves are also strong. So for example, if you look at North American media growth rate in Q4 of this past year, you are seeing that impact. So that's what you are seeing there.\nOperator: Our next question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Mahaney: Great. Thanks. Hi, Tom. Can I ask you a high-level question?\nTom Szkutak: Sure. Go for it, Mark.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Amazon has always pitched itself in terms of price, selection and convenience to customers. And I saw this great survey work that was done by Morgan Stanley in the last couple of weeks about this global survey that indicated a little bit of the shift in consumers' interest in online commerce more towards convenience. You must have a pretty good feel at Amazon for whether that broad value proposition to consumers is shifting. If it's shifting to be slightly less sensitive to price over the last couple of years and more towards convenience. Are you seeing that kind of shift? There's a lot of implications if that is, in fact, what is happening.\nTom Szkutak: I would say it this way, in terms of customer reaction, you see it really across the fundamental inputs that we have talked about for a long time. So in other words, in terms of speed of delivery and convenience, we see that with Prime members. Prime members are buying more. It's more convenient. They are getting their physical product to them faster versus being not a Prime member. So we certainly see that. So that's certainly speed of delivery helps. We need to make sure and it's something that we are always focused on is making sure we have great prices and that's every single item across categories, across geographies. So it's something we are focused on. We do think that's important for customers. And we need to have the selection, be in stock. When a customer comes to our detail page, it matters. And so I don't view it as a shift. I view it as there is certainly a lot of visibility and transparency around all of these. That's what shopping and operating a business online does. There is just amount of transparency. We think we like that world. And that's something that we continue to focus on those inputs so that we can be successful in that world and that's not something new. That's something we have been focusing on for a long time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein: Hi. Thanks. Two questions. One, just if you can clarify any impact of the Fire phone in the quarter? And then secondly, can you talk about how fuel prices impact your model? And I know the shippers, they use a trailing index to calculate fuel, how those savings would show up? Or if you would pass those on to third parties, et cetera? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Yes. I don't have really any callout for the Fire phone. We continue to sell. I had mentioned, we have a little bit over $80 million of inventory at the end of the Q3 and it will continue to sell through that in Q4. In terms of fuel prices, not a lot to callout there in terms of impact on the quarter. Certainly, over a long period of time, if it's sustainable we should see some benefits there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster: Good afternoon. Over the past couple of years, it's just been a little bit of a roller coaster with margins for investors. There is points of optimism followed by points of frustration and there is really some optimism here in this report. Is there anything that you can help investors with to understand just how you think about different cycles of investing to try to smooth out some of this roller coaster mentality that happens with the stock? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Well, in terms of, I would describe it this way, Gene, we have a lot of opportunities in front of us that we have talked about and we are also being selective with those opportunities. We have added lot of resources over the past few years. We certainly have been in the heavy investment cycle. I mentioned earlier we are in the process of finalizing our plan for 2015. We always put energy into various productivity measures but we are putting, the team is putting even more focus on those efforts as we finalize our 2015 plans. We will have to see where that ends up, but we are putting more energy and focus around our various fixed productivity or expense productivity, efficiency projects and again a wide range of different activities. And so that's what we are doing and you will have to stay tuned to see how that progresses as we go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Sandler: Hi. Thanks, Tom. I have two questions. First on India, can you talk about the India opportunity broadly and maybe some advantages you may have versus some of the local peers in terms of leveraging your scale? That market appears to be just on fire right now. So just a little bit of color on India. And then on Prime, can you talk about the Prime member behavior in terms of purchasing frequency? How it looks today versus may be a Prime member that joined two years ago? I know it looks a lot different from those very early Prime adopters from six, seven years ago. But just more recently, over the last couple of years, is the behavior consistent as you grow the base? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. In terms of India, we think it's very, very early. We are investing certainly in India and we think it's a very interesting opportunity. We have a very good team there and we are excited to participate. Again we think it is very early and so we like the opportunity there. In terms of Prime, there is not a lot I can help you with on that. But what I would say is this, certainly as you think about customers who are not Prime that become Prime, we see a very sizable step up their purchasing patterns. And so the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us. And one of the things that we are seeing, another thing that we are seeing is certainly, as Jeff references and I quote, \"Prime has evolved. It is both a physical and digital offering. It's unique that way.\" We see, for example, although it's still very early and we are learning and investing in this area, but I take video content, for example, what we see is customers that come in who come in through our Prime pipeline for video for free trial, those customers are converting at higher rates than other channels. We see that customers that are video streamers, even though we have high renewal rates, they are renewing at even higher rates than others. We see those people who were customers who were streaming have very similar purchase patterns on the physical product side as those who don't. And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from a customer experience standpoint which we think is great. And so those are the things that we are seeing in Prime right now. And with Prime being almost 10 years old, growing at 53% year-over-year on a sizable base, tens of millions, we think is very interesting. It's something that we are very focused on as we continue forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS Investment Research.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. On the topic of China, I wanted to know if you could help us either qualitatively or quantitatively understand what the trajectory or the size of the business is in China? And then maybe the trajectory around investments needed to compete in China? And how you think about the opportunity there long-term, looking through the lens of the competitive landscape and maybe Amazon's particular skill set on going to market in China? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. We haven't broken out the size of the business. I can't help you much there, but we continue to work on the customer experience there. The team has some interesting ideas that you will have to stay tuned on, of how to make that experience better. And we continue to work on it. So there is not a lot more that I can add to that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.\nJohn Blackledge: Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. In North American media, aside from the video game impact, just wondering if there are any other factors driving the low or flattish growth year-over-year? And then, CapEx was up about 40% in 2014. It's kind of bounced around over the years. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of the level of growth in 2015? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the North American media, a number of different certainly puts and takes there, but certainly by far the biggest one is the one I called out, which is the video game console. So if you look at the growth rate in Q4 last year, meaning 2013 and Q4 2014, you see a big difference. And the biggest, the most sizable difference there is certainly the video game consoles portion and the video games associated with those. So another way to say it is, the video game consoles and video games portion of that is down year-over-year and obviously years ago we put the videogame consoles as part of North American media to keep it with video games and they are larger ASP items as well that go in there. So certainly having an impact on that one when you look at the growth or when you compare Q4 2013 growth to Q4 2014 growth there. In terms of CapEx, we are not giving guidance on the 2015 spend, but given the high usage rates that we have had in web services, you should expect that we will be spending CapEx to support that growth and we will certainly be adding new fulfillment centers as we go. Also keep in mind that we do also finance capital. So if you look at our capital lease activity point to that, that's also increased in activity over the last few years. Certainly a number of different types of CapEx that go into that financing, but the biggest piece is certainly infrastructure to support our business primarily on the AWS side. So again that's also included in that number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thanks. Tom, I was hoping you could give us some kind of sense of the impact on delivery times and conversion rates that you saw during this holiday season from the investments that you made in fulfillment, particularly the sortation centers that were added before the holidays? And then also, to what degree you have seen some leverage, or some of the slower growth in fulfillment costs from moving more of the fulfillment obligation to first party owned infrastructure?\nTom Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the sort centers and I would say, just in addition to sort centers, what's happened over the course of last several years is, with all the fulfillment centers that we have added, we have actually invested gotten selection closer to customers. And so that's helped us from a delivery speed standpoint. It's helped us from a cost standpoint in terms of transportation cost being closer to customers. And so you it's a natural result of the footprint that we have added. In terms of sortation centers, there is a lot of different benefits of that. But certainly one of them is, as you get closer and closer, certainly throughout the year, it's helped us with holiday deliveries, it's helped us with Sunday deliveries and as we have closer to, in this case December to the end of holidays, it's certainly helped us from a delivery to the customer standpoint. So we are very pleased with the performance of those sortation centers. And really the global team of fulfillment team around the world, I think they did a terrific job during the holiday season as they did throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair and Company.\nMark Miller: Hi. Good afternoon. There's quite a disparate performance between North America and international in terms of the profit change year-on-year, up nearly $300 million, North America down over $100 million. So could you just help us understand why the international performance is so much weaker? Perhaps give us some color on the established markets in Europe relative to emerging markets. In the past, you have also discussed Japan. And then, is there an inflection point where international profits we could expect to head up again?\nTom Szkutak: Sure. The first one is, certainly the growth rates are slower in international versus North America, certainly would have an impact. The second, as we continue to invest in international in terms of adding capacity for infrastructure, for fulfillment capacity, as you know, if you look at our international growth rates, the unit growth rates are actually growing at a higher rate than revenue. And then emerging geographies. We talked about India earlier. Very excited about India. We are investing in India. We are also investing in China. So those are certainly impacting the results as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about gross margins. They were up quite a bit year-over-year and it looks like, in our numbers, EGM beat and media missed. So any thoughts on the mix shift there helping or hurting gross margins? What are the key drivers for that line and can AWS continue to drive that in 2015? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Certainly, AWS mix of business is having an impact. AWS is certainly part of that and impacting that. Also just to keep in mind, our third-party unit growth is growing at a faster rate than retail and so certainly that's having an impact. And then obviously, continuing to lower prices for customers as well as working with our partners on the vendor side to support those activities from a pricing standpoint. So those are the dynamics. And in terms of 2015 beyond the guidance that we are giving, there is not a lot of callout there, but we have had a great success of being able to grow our retail offerings. Our marketplace side has grown very nicely over the years including 2014. The team has done a great job there. Fulfilled by Amazon, in terms of number of sellers, continue to grow there. The percentage of paid physical units are approximately 40%, a little over 40% of the total there. So that's become much more meaningful over the past several years. So very happy about that. So all those contribute to the numbers that you just talked about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Good afternoon. One question as a follow-up on AWS and specifically some of the announcements related to WorkMail and WorkSpaces. This would signal that Amazon is moving up the stack towards a more of a SaaS offering. Is that the right interpretation? And if so, should we expect a broadening of those SaaS product initiatives? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: I am very happy to make a launch that you mentioned, we think it's exciting. It's certainly, you know we are excited overall about web services offerings. The team has done an incredible job in terms of innovation as well as operating these large services that scale. So they are doing a terrific job. In terms of what we might or might not do in the future, we are not talking about what that roadmap is. You will have to stay tuned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equity Research.\nBen Schachter: Tom, can you just give any color on how you are evaluating the opportunities to show video advertising against the ever-increasing video content? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: We really aren't using advertising too much in that area. You have seen it a little bit on some of our original content but beyond that we really can't comment. We think the experience we have is great for customers. We get a lot of positive feedback on the content that we have there and the uninterrupted content, if you will. And so I wouldn't speculate on what we might or might not do there. But we are getting great feedback from customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi & Hardt. James, your line is live. Please proceed with your question. James, if you have muted your line, please unmute it.\nPhil Hardin: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2014 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.\nPhil Hardin: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 23, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 15% to $5.71 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.08 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.63 billion. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operation. Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 3%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 481 million shares compared with 475 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $20.58 billion or 20% excluding the $13 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $5.24 billion, up 4% or 4% excluding exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.95 billion, up 26% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 68% of worldwide sales, up from 65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 21%. Active customer accounts was approximately 260 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 42% of paid units. Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.63 billion or 71.1% of revenue compared with 72.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $6.09 billion or 29.6% of sales, up approximately 350 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.55 billion or 12.4% of revenue compared with 11.5%. Tech and content was $2.22 billion or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $961 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 3.9%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 25% to $12.87 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.73 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $8.79 billion, representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 40% to $1.34 billion. North America segment operating income decreased 70% to $88 million, a 0.7% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 14% to $7.71 billion. Excluding the $21 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 13%. Media revenue grew 4% to $2.51 billion or 3% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 20% to $5.16 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 64%. International segment operating loss was $224 million compared to international segment operating loss of $28 million in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating loss was $136 million compared to consolidated segment operating income of $267 million in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating loss includes charges of approximately $170 million, primarily related to the Fire phone inventory evaluation and supplier commitment cost. Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $544 million compared to operating loss of $25 million in the prior period. Our income tax benefit was $205 million, GAAP net loss was $437 million or $0.95 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $41 million and $0.09 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $806 million year-over-year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 21% to $7.32 billion and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.2 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $11.81 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 75 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlement, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they\u2019ve been recently. For Q4 2014, we expect net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion or growth between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 250 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $570 million loss and $430 million income compared to $510 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $470 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense to be between $100 million loss and $900 million in income compared to $876 million in income in the fourth quarter of 2013. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareowners. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.\nPhil Hardin: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from analyst Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company.\nBrian Pitz - Jefferies: Great thanks. Two quick questions. Can you provide any color on the consumer over this year's back-to-school season and how do you view the outlook for the consumer as we head into the holidays? And then separately you recently closed the acquisition of Twitch last month. Can you help us understand where does Twitch fit into your overall digital content strategy? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Sure, in terms of back-to-school, certainly the results are reflected in the Q3 results that you see today. There's a number of different impacts back-to-school has. One thing I would like to call out, as you look at our North American media growth rates one thing that we are seeing is certainly a shift from a text book standpoint from purchase to rental and so we see a lot more customers renting. So you see that impacting the growth rate a bit the North American media. But in terms of Q4 as in any Q4, when we look at it, there is a wide range of outcomes. We're giving a wide range of guidance. What we feel good about is we have a team that's been improving customer experience over the past twelve months. We're very excited to serve customers. We've had a lot of unique selection. We've got inventory closer to the customers. Many, many different things that we're doing on behalf of customers. So we are very excited about the holiday season and look forward to serving customers. In terms of Twitch, we're very excited to have Twitch as part of our overall team. We've been in video games for quite some time and we think that it's a very creative team. They're doing some very innovative things on behalf of their customers and our customers and so we're excited to have them, be part of Amazon and look forward to working together with that team.\nBrian Pitz - Jefferies: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Carlos Kirjner analyst with Bernstein.\nCarlos Kirjner - Bernstein: Thank you for taking my question. Two if I may. International CSOI margin this quarter were the lowest they have been in years, maybe ever, I don\u2019t know. We know you have been investing internationally but has something changed fundamentally and if yes, what? Secondly, I wanted to ask you about vast difference in revenue growth rate between your international and domestic business. What is fundamentally different between the U.S. and your main international markets and is this difference fundamental or temporary? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Thank you. Thanks for the question. In terms of the consolidated segment or the segment operating income, excuse me, for international, certainly versus what you'd have seen last quarter some notable changes, one is we're certainly getting ready for the holiday season, so as to get ready for the holiday season. We are expanding from a capacity standpoint. We do see -- we've gotten great penetration and Fulfilled by Amazon customers. So you'll see that actually our growth rate -- unit growth rate is actually higher than our revenue growth rate and so that's what we've been experiencing so certainly adding capacity from a fulfillment perspective, adding capacity from a infrastructure standpoint. If you look at our overall operating expenses, we are certainly investing and with the slower growth rate you're not seeing as -- certainly not seeing as much leverage. We understand that we do have to get leverage over time, but we are investing right now. We're also investing in newer emerging geographies including India and Italy and Spain and continue to invest in China.  And then one other call out, we -- mentioned in my opening remarks there was approximately $170 million impact related to inventory evaluation and supplier commitment costs, a vast majority of that was in North America, but there was about $25 million in international just to let you know that that's there. In terms of the growth rate, it has been softer across a number of geographies. If you look back over the past really four quarters, we've seen a little bit of volatility between the quarters, but it's been softer. We continue to focus on the inputs and we still think international is a very big opportunity for us in terms of growth. More recently if you look at the growth rate for Q3 and you see the 13% excluding foreign exchange, you may remember on the last call about 90 days ago, I talked about Q2 what had happened was we had seen -- in late Q1 we had seen a ramp up in Japan before the consumption tax increase happened on April 1. We saw a pretty sizable drop off in Japan growth rates from Q1 to Q2, which brought that down. The only update again is the number of different puts and takes by geographies, but the only other comment I would say is that we really haven\u2019t seen Japan growth rates improving since Q2. So that's something that's there. But in terms of the fundamentals, long term we're very excited about international as well as North America. We think it's a big opportunity. We continue to focus on the inputs. Some of those inputs are certainly on the media side working on the conversion from physical media to digital media. We continue to work on that in a number of different ways. We continue to add new selection in those geographies and work on the retail basics and so again we're very excited about the opportunity.\nCarlos Kirjner - Bernstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next call will come from analyst Scott Devitt with Stifel.\nScott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus: Hey Tom, thanks. I had a question just broadly. A lot of the capital that's been deployed in terms of planting seeds and new businesses have worked out very well, but given what's happening right now in terms of the deterioration in the margin structure as growth is slowing, I am just wondering and I think a lot of investors have this question as well and in terms of when things don't go as anticipated in some of the bigger projects where there is not a revenue stream like areas maybe like some of the hardware projects and China and other markets, what's the process for determining whether to plough ahead or turn back capital and redeploy in another areas. Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks for the question Scott. With anything new that we do and obviously we've done -- as you mentioned we've done a lot of new things. There is certainly a wide range of outcome and we certainly understand that. We try to learn from everything that we do as we launch new opportunities and so that's something across things that go great and things that don't go as well as others. We try to learn from that. And so the way I will describe it is from a looking forward standpoint we still think that we have a lot of opportunities. That said, we need to be very selective about what opportunities we pursue and so that's again the way we're thinking about it and probably not much more I can add to it than that.\nScott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure.\nOperator: And we'll continue on to analyst Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets: Two questions please. That $170 million in charges related to the Fire phone, where was that put in the P&L and which are the OpEx lines or was it a COGS? And then secondly on the media side, you talked about maybe seeing a negative impact or definitely seeing a negative impact from the switch towards owning to renting. Do you think that's a broader trend beyond just text books that affects all media retailers including Amazon? Could that have been -- could that be one of the issues behind the slow media growth in international markets and if so, is there really a solution to that other than your own rental -- your own rental models? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. In terms of the first question, the $170 million, it's predominately in COGS and so it's the very vast majority than COGS and then in terms of the split about 25 million is in international and the remainder is in North America. In terms of the growth, we certainly are seeing that in text books. We do see another - digital media, we're certainly seeing rentals being part for our portfolio more than we had probably during - certainly with physical, but in terms of some of the recent growth rates, the one that I called out related to book rentals are certainly impacting North American media. One of the other things that\u2019s certainly impacting it too is we did had some things last year Q3 that were overlapping, that were positive in Q3 last year from a demand standpoint. One was certainly in physical books we had very heavy discounting, which helped our growth in Q3 last year. We're overlapping that in Q3 this year.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now go to analyst Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.\nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: Hey there and thanks for taking my question. Hoping we can go back to square one here if you don't mind, can you tell us or remind us what financial measures are important to you guys and which financial measures do you hold yourselves and the Board hold you accountable to because it's a little hard to see any of them making positive progress, so I just would love to get back to basics?\nTom Szkutak: Sure, we're looking at a number of different metrics over a long period of time and certainly where our goal is to maximize free cash flow over the long term, we don't focus on individual margins, but we do focus on the inputs that are going to help drive free cash flow and operating income. We certainly will look at making sure that we're using our capital wisely so that over time we get good returns on invested capital and we certainly have been in several years now of what I would call an investment mode and because of the opportunities that we had in front of us. And as I mentioned earlier there is still lots of opportunity in front of us and -- but we know that we have to be very selective about which opportunities we pursue and -- but we're encouraged by the opportunities that we have.\nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: So cash flow and return on invested capital is where we should keep our attention.\nTom Szkutak: Yes.\nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: Okay. And are the employees in the recruiting side, is that becoming more difficult as the stocks has [faded] [ph] a little bit and those return characteristics have [faded] [ph], how are you making sure that you're hiring the best people?\nTom Szkutak: We have -- we have processes in place to make sure that we have a very high bar on the hiring that we do, the people that we're hiring are extraordinarily talented. We're very fortunate to get to work with so many talented people here and we've been fortunate to be able to grow that employment base to work on the opportunities that we have.\nAram Rubinson - Wolfe Research: Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll go to analyst Colin Gillis with BGC Financial.\nColin Gillis - BGC Financial: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So just to get back to that North American media sales, what's the lowest growth rate in over 20 years -- are there \u2013 or 20 quarters, are there other factors beyond the text book shifts and sort of the Q3 strength last year? Are the digital media trends still intact?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the principal drivers -- it's the two that I mentioned. So it's the text books rentals and also overlapping some of the strong discounting and strong titles that we had in some categories. So it's across a number of categories within media, but those are the two principle drivers.\nColin Gillis - BGC Financial: And you don't see this as a broader shift in that number?\nTom Szkutak: No, we're -- there's still both in terms of North America and international, there is certainly a shift that's going on from physical to digital and that's something that we're spending a lot of time on and trying to improve the experience for customers and we've been able to do that certainly over a period of time and so it's something we'll continue to work on.\nColin Gillis - BGC Financial: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll continue on to analyst Ron Josey with JMP Securities.\nRon Josey - JMP Securities: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two please. If you could update us on this rotation center rollout, are all 15 online, and I would love to know maybe how they\u2019ve helped bridge the last mile and improve overall speed delivery. And then the second question, sort of switching gears and just focusing on advertising, I believe a pilot was launched or beta was launched for Amazon's ad network called CPM Ads I think maybe last August. I am wondering if you can provide some commentary there. Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure, in terms of the sort centers, we'll have over 15 sort centers in the U.S. by the end of the year. It's certainly helping us a lot. We have same day delivery in 12 cities. We'll have Sunday delivery in approximately 50% of the population and so we're pleased to do that. And in terms of the ad network, there is a not a lot I can say there.\nRon Josey - JMP Securities: Okay. Thank you very much.\nTom Szkutak: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.\nAaron Kessler - Raymond James: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just give us an update maybe on your views on original programming? It looked like Transparents had some good success. Also just from an international standpoint your views or may be the growth in China, India as well, are you seeing any -- signs of any increasing competition in the international, your key international markets today? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. In terms of our original content, we're excited about it. We're investing as we talked about. Last quarter we spent approximately $100 million in the quarter. Keep in mind that that's expensed in the quarter and so that's included in the results that you see in Q3. We're very excited about it. We have a number of pilots as well as a number of series launched. Transparent you mentioned is one of them. It's gotten very good reviews. The streaming on that series has been great. So we're very excited about it and we think it's an interesting area for customers. We continue to invest heavily in video content including originals and there is a number of different metrics we're looking at certainly from a prime standpoint, but what we're seeing so far are those customers who are streaming are renewing at considerably higher rates at considerably higher rates at a rate that's already high. So we like what we see there. When customers come in for new trials and they -- free trials and they engage from a video content standpoint, we see the conversion being higher. So we see that we're adding new prime members as a result of that and when those prime members, when those new prime members become prime members, the other thing we're seeing is they're buying physical product, which is a great impact for us. We see very similar patterns in terms of how much physical product that they're purchasing from us and so we're still certainly in investment mode there, but we like what we see and we have a long way to go there, but we're concentrating on building great service and we see that customers are rewarding us with engagement on the content, both original and licensed and they're buying more from us on the physical side and becoming prime members when they do and have been doing at higher rates. So those are the some of the early signs and we will continue to monitor very closely, but we're excited about what we're seeing there. In terms of some of the international comments and I would say this for not just international, but I would say it for the U.S. as well, one thing that's not new is it's a very competitive environment. We have a lot of competitors both online and offline. That's not anything that's new. We used to operate in that environment. We've been in that environment for really for 19 years and so -- but we're seeing a lot of competition and again that's not new.\nAaron Kessler - Raymond James: Great. Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our nest question will come from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks. Last quarter you mentioned that the AWS business saw a 90% increase in volume. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you\u2019ve seen so far this quarter. And then in the highlight section of the release, the first six bullet points or so that you have there are all related to the hardware side of the business. if you can just sort of give us now that you have a little bit more time on the hardware side of the business, but behind if you can give us a sense of what you're learning in this category and where you think Amazon's long term position in hardware is ultimately going to be.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of AWS, we're -- we saw a very good growth in Q3 as well. From a usage standpoint it's very similar to Q2, close to 90% and so the team is doing just a fantastic job. You can see our other revenue in North America went up a little bit sequentially and AWS is certainly the largest piece of that and is the vast majority of it and they're growing at a faster rate than that other line item. So again the team is doing a fantastic job and not only serving customers, but launching many, many new features and services and you can see some of the detail on that in the Highlight section of our release today. So we're very excited about it. In terms of devices, I can't speculate what we would do going forward, but we just launched a number of new tablets and e-readers that were excited about and there is some really great price point for customers on the tablet side. We also launched a kid's tablet which is the first time we've launched. We've launched some new kindles including our premium kindle and it's a terrific product. We think it's the best kindle we've made to date for sure and so we're very excited about that. And we're excited to have these offerings for customers.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equities Research.\nBen Schachter - Macquarie: Hi Tom. You mentioned that you need to get leverage at some point. In the last call you also said something similar, but can you help us quantify the timing that in your internal modeling when do you expect to see more meaningful leverage and when you look at your three to five year's outlook, what does your leverage picture look like there and then also can you remind us of what your philosophy of stock buybacks is and what would it take to get you back in the market, thanks?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of leverage, beyond the guidance that we're giving today, there is not a lot of certainly I can give you, but again what I had mentioned earlier is we do have a lot of opportunities, but our job is to be judicious and selective about what opportunities we pursue. And so that's the way we're thinking about it and I apologize I can't give you any more certainty in terms of timing, but certainly that's the way we're thinking about it. And in terms of buybacks, we haven\u2019t opened buybacks right now. We have authorization to do that. I certainly can't comment on what price points we would or wouldn\u2019t do there.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you. If you look at the phone impact in Q3, it seems to explain some of the difference versus the Street, but when you look forward to Q4, it looks like you\u2019re guiding to about 15% to 16% growth ex FX and again profits maybe below some expectations. Is the phone having an impact on profits in Q4 as well? And also when you think about the Q4 guidance are there any events or things you want to call out? Are you being especially conservative in Q4 giving recent trends? Anything different this year on holiday? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Yes. In terms of the holiday season just and if you look back the last several years, I've been giving wide ranges because it\u2019s again a more seasonal quarter, always challenging to predict precisely where we're going to be. So in terms of a dollar range I gave us $3 billion range last year. I am giving a $3 billion range again this year from a revenue perspective again wide range. At the higher end of the range, excluding foreign exchange, it's approximately 21%. So it's a little bit higher than what we saw in Q3 and then you can see we're on the low end of the range. In terms of -- but in terms of the season itself, we're very excited about it. And in terms of to serve customers, we feel great about the selection that we have added and are continuing to add for the holiday season. We think from an operations standpoint each year we try to get better and we believe we'll be even better this year than we have had in previous years. And so we are super excited to serve customers. In terms of the phone, the only other thing that I can comment on is at the end of Q3, we had approximately $83 million worth of inventory on hand. And so I can't comment on how that would impact guidance or not, but that's the amount of inventory we had on hand at the end of Q3.\nJustin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next analyst will be John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.\nJohn Blackledge - Cowen & Company: Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. We saw that Amazon Fresh expanded into Brooklyn recently. Just wondering if we can discuss your decision to expand into New York City and how we should think about timings for expansion into other markets and then if you can update us on the number of fulfillment centers globally and in the year that would be great. Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Sure, in terms of the number of fulfillment centers it's 13 net for the year and then on as I mentioned earlier in the U.S. we'll have 15 sort centers by the end of more than 14, excuse me, more than 15 sort centers by the end of the year. In terms of, sorry the other part of the question was on Fresh, the team is doing a great job from a customer experience standpoint. As you can see we're in a few cities. Today, the team is just heads down focused on making sure that experience is great for customers. We continue -- customers like the service. So we're seeing good pick up there and as you mentioned, we're expanding in the Brooklyn. I can't speculate on what we do beyond the cities that we have launched today, but we're excited about what we're seeing so far there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Eric Sheridan with UBS.\nEric Sheridan - UBS: Thanks for taking the question. Tom you guys put thorough a price increase on the prime services here. Was curious what you were seeing in terms of the impact of that price increase on both the rate of adding people into Prime and the ability to control churn inside the Prime subscription base in general. And as you add additional functionality and layers into Prime like you\u2019ve done this year through the investments, whether you\u2019ve thought about maybe put in another price increase through next year. Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of what we do going forward it certainly wouldn\u2019t speculate. We had a price point since our initiation of, excuse me, since the launch of Prime. Its $79 and so it took us long time and we were very careful with that to increase it to $99. But since we've increased to $99 we've had -- we've had great retention. We're very pleased with the -- the retention we've had from customers. The program is growing very fast. We're very excited about it and so we do think it's really good for customers and it\u2019s really good for us and shareowners over the long term. You're correct in that we're investing in Prime in a number of different ways including video content as I talked about earlier that is certainly the way we'll get a return on that investment. Principally will be customers buying more including and especially physical products. So again we're very excited about Prime globally.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next analyst will be Brian Nowak with SIG.\nBrian Nowak - SIG: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two please. The first one, fulfillment ex stock based comp was the highest it's ever been as a percentage of gross profit in the third quarter, can you just talk about the drivers of that? Is that for rotations centers or international growth, what's driving that? And then as we think about this rotation centers, what's the impact of those over the next few quarters to fulfillment? Are they do they take a while to kind of get the inefficiencies out of the system like a standard DC would?\nTom Szkutak: Yes, in terms of fulfillment cost, you're right. Again we're adding 13 net fulfillment centers where we added -- we'll have over 15 sort centers at the end of the year. certainly one of the drivers for that is certainly the growth that we are experiencing, but in addition to that, what we're seeing is the FBA adoption continues to get better and if we get further penetrated with sellers adopting full by Amazon, we think that's really good for sellers and for us and for customers over the long term. And what you're seeing is we're several years ago in terms of performance center planning we were adding less of them and it was much closer to the holiday season. With the sheer amount of capacity that we're adding, you're seeing more of that come in even before Q4. So you're seeing that impacting us earlier and the benefit of coming in earlier is we get to serve customer and get up to the productivity rates that we want to, to serve customers in Q4, by having that capacity in a bit earlier than in the past. So you\u2019ve seen that trend happen over the past few years with that coming in earlier than certainly historically we've been able to do.\nBrian Nowak - SIG: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next analyst will be Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.\nMatt Nemer - Wells Fargo: Thanks so much for taking my questions. First Prime launched a referral fee recently and I am wondering if we should take that as any indication that the membership growth has slowed or you're seeing some higher churn and how does that referral fee get accounted for. And then secondly, Target launched free shipping with no hurdle for the holidays versus your $35 hurdle, I am just wondering what your willingness is to leave that competitive gap during the holidays, thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Yes, can't comment from a competitive standpoint what we might or might do there, but in terms of the Prime referral fee, no, you should not read into that that Prime isn\u2019t growing well and in fact just the opposite. We\u2019re seeing great growth and we like the fact that enabling customers because they like Prime to be able to refer others we think is great for us and so I can't actually maybe offline you can follow-up with Phil or Dave on the accounting. Top of my head, I can't remember how that's working, but I know they will be able to answer it for you.\nMatt Nemer - Wells Fargo: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.\nColin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. A couple of follow-ups. First off in terms of the Q4 revenue guide, are you giving any consideration to that forecast to some of the shipping issues that happened last holiday and the ability of your shipping partners to manage your growth. And then secondly on paid units, can you provide a splits or color between physical and digital unit growth. Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of -- in terms of the guidance it reflects all of the assumptions that we think could happen for the quarter. So again it's a wide range to speak specifically to some of the issues last year. The team again -- we continue trying to learn from everything that we do and the team has done a great job learning from our experiences, coming out of Q4 last year as we do every year and are excited to serve customers. In terms of the unit growth, there is not I can add in terms of split other than the overall -- other than the overall growth rate, but we are -- we are pleased with certainly we're seeing good customer growth, sellers are -- we're doing we think a great job for sellers. We continue to add a lot of unique selection throughout the year in terms of and we have customers. We see FBA four sellers getting further, further penetrated. We've launched some interest in products for our customers. We think our web services team is doing a great job. We realize that we have a lot of opportunities, but we need to be selective on which opportunities we pursue and I think beyond that, we're just overall excited and again ready for the holiday season. So anyway thanks everybody for calling in today.\nPhil Hardin: Thank you for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-07-24 20:31:03", "content": "Executives: Phil Hardin - Director of Investor Relations Tom Szkutak - Chief Financial Officer\nAnalysts: Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein Neil Doshi - CRT Capital Eric Sheridan - UBS Kaizad Gotla - JPMorgan Mark May - Citi Brian Pitz - Jefferies Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs John Blackledge - Cowen & Company Ben Schachter - Macquarie Mark Miller - William Blair Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Brian Nowak - SIG Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets Greg Melich - ISI Group Colin Sebastian - Robert Baird & Company\nOperator: Good day and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2014 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Also, today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the conference over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead, sir.\nPhil Hardin: Hello and welcome to our Q2 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 24, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 18% to $5.33 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.04 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.29 billion. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services. Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 2%, ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 480 million shares compared with 474 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.34 billion or 22% excluding the $237 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $4.84 billion, up 10% or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.28 billion, up 27% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 69% of worldwide sales, up from 66%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer accounts exceeded 250 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units. Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.4 billion or 69.3% of revenue compared with 71.4%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $5.54 billion or 28.6% of sales, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.28 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.2%. Tech and content was $2.02 billion or 10.4% of revenue compared with 9.1%. Marketing was $911 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.1%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $12 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.46 billion or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 29% to $8.37 billion, representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 68%. Other revenue grew 38% to $1.17 billion. North America segment operating income increased 7% to $438 million, a 3.7% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.34 billion. Excluding the $246 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 4% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 25% to $4.91 billion or 20% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%. International segment operating loss was $34 million compared to zero in the prior period. CSOI decreased 1% to $404 million or 2.1% of revenue, down approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rate, CSOI decreased 9%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $15 million compared to operating income of $79 million in the prior-year period. Our income tax expense was $94 million, and this includes approximately $90 million of discrete tax items primarily attributable to audit-related developments. GAAP net loss was $126 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $7 million and $0.02 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $523 million year-over-year to $7.99 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $6.64 billion, and inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.4 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 16% to $10.46 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 71 from 73 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q3 2014, we expect net sales of between $19.7 billion and $21.5 billion or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 120 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $810 million loss and a $410 million loss compared to a $25 million loss in the third quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $410 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $400 million loss and zero compared to $267 million of income in the third quarter of 2013. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.\nPhil Hardin: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We'll hear first today from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.\nCarlos Kirjner - Bernstein: Tom, you mentioned in the past that China is an area of investments. Can you say a little bit about what are the main drivers of investment there, whether it's marketing pricing fulfillment? And how do you decide on any given year how much we invest in China, just given the size of the potential market and opportunity? And secondly, we saw a material deceleration in the North America other revenues. Was this primarily driven by AWS deceleration, and is this deceleration a meaningful contributor to the losses implied in your next quarter guidance?\nTom Szkutak: Yes, North America other includes a number of things including Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services is the largest part of North America other. As we talked about on last call, we had very substantial price reductions for customers starting in second quarter. They ranged from 28% to 51% depending on the service. But AWS continues to grow very strongly. In Q2, we had usage growth close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter. So the team is doing a fantastic job. And we put in some price reductions that were very substantial that are saving customers hundreds and millions of dollars over the next several months, as we mentioned 90 days ago. But again, we love that business. It's doing great and we're very pleased to have the opportunity to invest in it. The team is innovating very quickly. In fact, so far year-to-date, they've released 250 significant service and features and that's at a pace that's much, much faster than last year's pace, which was faster than the year before. So again, they're continuing to innovate on behalf of customers. And so we're investing. And so that's certainly impacting both the pricing decisions we've made. They're certainly impacting the guidance. Also, the large amount of CapEx in infrastructure for that business is certainly impacting the guidance along with a number of other things across the business that we're investing in. But we're very pleased to do that. In terms of China, we're continuing to invest on behalf of customers there, obviously trying to make the experience even better for customers in terms of improved in-stock levels. We've certainly added a lot of fulfillment capacity over time in China, and we're doing a lot of interesting things to better serve customers in China. In terms of some of the other parts of your question, there's not much more I can add to that.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.\nNeil Doshi - CRT Capital: Tom, can you talk a little bit about the deceleration in the units? And then also, in terms of the third-party dollar, it looks like you're trending around 40%. For a while, it ticked up a little bit to 41%. And so if we adjust for digital, how should that trend be looking?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of unit growth, we had 23% unit growth year-over-year. It is down from last year's growth rate, but it's consistent with what we've seen recently including the last quarter. And in terms of the third-party units as a percentage of total units, you're right that's 41% this quarter. It's up about 100 basis points. And we're not breaking out the digital versus physical on that. But again, very strong third-party growth, a number of factors, but certainly FBA is helping third-party growth.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.\nEric Sheridan - UBS: Looking through the expense lines, tech and content seem to have an upward pressure in the quarter. Why don't you maybe give a little more granularity on what was driving that upward pressure and whether that's sort of a new run rate of expense as we saw in the first half of this year?\nTom Szkutak: There's a number of things that are going into the tech and content line. But you're right we're the ones that I just mentioned, we are investing in various parts of the business, but certainly for Amazon Web Services, that's both from an infrastructure standpoint to support the very fast usage growth that we're experiencing. Again, we have usage growth close to 90% year-over-year in the second quarter for Web Services. In addition to that, over the past year, we've added thousands of people in Web Services. So again, ramping that up. And then across a number of different other investment areas, we continue to add great technical resources to do the things we're doing in digital and many other parts of the company. So again, we have a lot of opportunities to invest in, as you can see from a lot of the releases that we've had over the past 12 months, and you're certainly seeing that reflected in our actual results as well.\nOperator: And next from JPMorgan, we'll go to Douglas Anmuth.\nKaizad Gotla - JPMorgan: This is Kaizad Gotla for Doug. I was wondering if you could just talk about the deceleration in your international EGM line. And then separately, now that you've had Prime price increases in effect for about three months, wondering if you could just talk about any changes you've seen in sign-ups or conversions there.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of international EGM, and this would really related to total international growth as well, we saw 18% growth on a dollar basis, 14% growth on a local currency growth basis. We're just down a little bit sequentially from what we saw in Q1. Obviously there's variability from quarter-to-quarter in each of the geographies that we operate in. One call-out which impacted certainly EGM and our total international growth rate is Japan. We saw on April 1st, the consumption tax was increased from 5% to 8%. Leading up to that in the latter part of Q1, we certainly saw accelerated growth, so that was reflected in the Q1 results. In Q2, we saw some corresponding softness in Q2 following that. Hard to know how much was related to consumption growth, but certainly as you've probably read elsewhere that others are seeing that too. So it probably reflects the consumption tax increase. But if you take out Japan out of both Q1 and Q2, the growth rates on a local currency basis were very similar within approximately 100 basis points of each other. In terms of Prime, Prime subscribers are growing very nicely year-over-year. In fact, we had more Prime subscribers in Q2 of this year than in Q2 of last year. So we're very pleased and we continue to get new subscribers as well as existing customers responding to the great value they're getting out of Prime.\nOperator: And from Citi, we'll go to Mark May.\nMark May - Citi: Based on sort of what you've talked about in the disclosures around the price, the amount of the price decreases, the common sense would suggest that all if not most of the CSOI margin decline that you posted in Q2 year-on-year is related to the AWS price changes. And the common sense would also suggest that given the significant volume gains that you're seeing in that business that Q2 might be the most impacted quarter from that yet. The third quarter guidance suggests that it's having an even greater impact on Q3. Just wondering if you could help us think through that. Is there some timing issue related to the impact of that, or is there something else going on within the core retail business or maybe some other one-time items that might be impacting your Q3 outlook?\nTom Szkutak: We're not quantifying the impact of the price changes on our Q2 and Q3, but it is fair to say that it certainly did impact our Q2 results in a meaningful way. And that's reflected in the results that you're seeing. Another thing to keep in mind as you look out related to AWS is we're continuing to invest in that business. And with the great strong usage growth rates that we're seeing, we're also investing in CapEx and infrastructure to support that growth. So again, the team has done a fantastic job innovating on behalf of customers. And as I mentioned earlier, the new releases both from a service and feature perspective was about 250 year-to-date, which is at a pace that's much faster than we've seen over the last few years with very high bar, given all the innovation that's happened from that team in that space. So again, there are certainly things that are impacting Q3 guidance. There's a number of other things. When you look at Q3, keep in mind if you look back over the last several years, we're getting ready for Q4 seasonal quarter. And when that happens, if you look back, certainly you've seen our CSOI usually has been at the lowest point for the year during Q3, particularly during these high growth years. And so we've announced that we're adding six net new fulfillment centers. And we've also announced that we'll have 15 or more sortation centers. The sortation centers help us get closer to customers, so that we can have fastest delivery speed as well as deliver on Sundays, which is a big deal for us in the US. So we're very pleased to be able to do that. On top of that, other investment areas that are certainly impacting our Q3 guidance is we like what we see on the content side. So video content, for example, we're ramping up the spend from Q2 to Q3 significantly. And so it'll be also a significant growth year-over-year. Keep in mind we have two types of content. We have license content. We also have original content. A lot of you have probably seen a lot of the announcements that we've green-lighted a number of pilots. We're going to be in heavy production in those series that have been green-lit during Q3. We've also announced a number of pilots that will be in production on. And so that original content, it's a portion of our total content, will be over $100 million in Q3. Just as a reminder, we do not capitalize that portion of our original content. Its expense is incurred. So that's over $100 million in Q3. And again, that's ramped up considerably both on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis. Other areas that we're investing in, certainly with the launch of some new devices more recently over the past couple of quarters between Fire Phone and Fire TV and others, over time we've invested in devices. So that's certainly an area we're investing in. We're investing in a lot of different areas including geographic expansion. We talked about China on one of the earlier questions. But certainly India, we're investing very heavily. We're seeing some very positive results there. The team is doing a fantastic job. We're also investing in other geographies as well, Italy and Spain and others. So again, we're encouraged by just the sheer magnitude of opportunities we have and we're investing in those opportunities.\nOperator: We'll move next to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.\nBrian Pitz - Jefferies: First question on FBA. Any insights on the penetration of third-party sellers using FBA. Maybe you could comment just directionally? Is the number trending up or down? And separately, it's been less than a week, but can you comment on early feedback to Kindle Unlimited by customers and publishers? Do you expect this to be the model for digital book consumption in the future?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of FBA, it's doing great. I can't provide a specific percent. But it's really since the time we've launched continued to increase as a percentage of total third-party units. And so the service has done very well. The team continues to work on making it even better on behalf of sellers and customers. In terms of Kindle Unlimited, it's very early, but we're extremely pleased with what we see. There's been a great reaction to it. And we're pleased to offer that to customers.\nOperator: Moving next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs: You mentioned that you were happy with the results that you're seeing from the video content. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of sort of how that manifests itself, whether it's more Prime subscribers, whether it's more consumption of downloadable video content within the ecosystem. And then, Tom, to the extent that you're talking about sort of AWS volume increases on a year-over-year basis, can you give us a sense of how that may have trended over the course of the quarter as your AWS customers were able to sort of adapt to the price reduction in March?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of content, we've seen just more and more customers are streaming, more and more Prime members are streaming free content. We're seeing through our pipeline as customers join Prime, we're seeing that we have more and more customers taking free trials and then converting. Those customers are great customers. In addition to streaming free content, they have great purchasing patterns, doing a lot of cross-shopping on physical products as well as converting to paid digital video and other digital products as well. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. And when you look at the service that we have today, it's improved dramatically over the past 12 to 24 months. And we really think it's a great service and that's why we're investing in it. In terms of AWS, there's not much I can help you with on that. But again, just to reiterate, we saw very strong growth during Q2 with usage growth rates close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter. And we're extremely happy with what we see there, and the team has done a fantastic job, continue to innovate on behalf of customers.\nOperator: We'll hear next from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.\nJohn Blackledge - Cowen & Company: Just a couple of question, first on AWS. Just wondering your take on the competitive environment in public cloud, has it intensified over the past six to 12 months, just given the investments in AWS? How do you view AWS's competitive positioning? And then if you could just touch on the key drivers of EGM growth in North America, and are those the same drivers of growth internationally or are there different drivers North America versus international?\nTom Szkutak: They work hard to be able to afford lower prices for customers. That's something that is instilled in all of Amazon and something certainly is instilled in our Web Services team. And their folks on what they do best, which is innovating on behalf of customers, operating these services at the highest quality levels, and they continue to work on getting more efficient, so that we can have great prices for customers. And so that's a team that's focused and they're doing a great job. In terms of EGM growth between North America and international, there's not a lot I can call out there. It has many different categories across many different geographies, many different ASINs both first party and third party. So it's hard to comment. The only thing I would call for attention is the comment I made earlier around international growth rates related to EGM, and that was the consumption tax increase in Japan that we saw a lead in Q1 where we saw very strong growth leading up to that point and it softened after the rates went into effect. But other than that, there's not a lot to call out.\nOperator: We'll now go to Macquarie's Ben Schachter.\nBen Schachter - Macquarie: When you mentioned that AWS is growing 90% year-over-year, what exactly is growing 90%? Is it storage? Is it something else? And then on the phone itself, are there any key differences in how we should be thinking about that piece of hardware versus other hardware you've done in the past where Jeff has discussed the notion of potentially one to breakeven? And then just a follow-up on that. How are you modeling the impact of the phone on the P&L in 3Q? Is it going to be more or less than the original content initiative?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of AWS, it's really aggregation of usage across all of our services year-over-year. Think of it as almost a proxy similar to unit growth on our retail business. It's a proxy to say how fast the physical volume is growing. And so that's what it's a proxy for. In terms of the phone, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. We're extremely pleased to get it in customers' hands. We think it's a premium product. You get a 32 gigabyte phone, premium product, one-year free subscription to Prime along with all the other features that I'm sure you've read about. So again, we're very pleased to get it to customers and start shipping. And customers have started to receive those today.\nOperator: And from William Blair, we'll go to Mark Miller.\nMark Miller - William Blair: Many investments, it looks like where you are getting a return is in the gross margin. If I take out AWS, it looks like you're up nearly 200 basis points. What are the drivers of that e-commerce margin increase? Are you seeing it primarily on the first-party margin expansion? And if so, why? And how much is coming from third-party unit increase?\nTom Szkutak: We don't actually focus on total company gross margins because of the mix of the business. We focus more on operating profit and obviously ultimately free cash flow dollars. But in terms of things that would be impacting COGS as a percentage of revenue and that change, to be helpful, you mentioned AWS is certainly having an impact there. Our third-party business continues to have an impact there. We have offsets as we lower prices to customers, having an impact there. Just mix of various products and geographies has an impact on those results. Again, a large number of items that are impacting that.\nOperator: And Justin Post with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch has our next question.\nJustin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Tom, there might be a little bit of a disconnect. When we see prior investment cycles such as distribution builds out or devices with, say, the Kindle reader, we did see an impact on units and accelerating growth in some of the categories. This time around, even investing for a couple of years and I guess we're not really seeing the acceleration. So maybe you could talk about what gives you confidence in investing in devices like the Fire TV and the phone and all the content you're doing? And are you seeing some underlying signs, let's say, activities picking up? Maybe you could walk through that.\nTom Szkutak: Just a couple of things to call out. One is when we look at our unit growth, you hear the 23% unit growth, keep in mind that there're parts of our business that are not included in that unit growth. So when we talk about investing in Web Services and the usage growing close to 90%, that number is not included in the 23%. So that's obviously a large investment area for us that we're excited about that is not included in that. The other is think about the base of business that we have versus where we were just a few years ago. And so you've seen very strong growth on the base that we have. And we're excited to see that. When we look at the opportunities that we're investing in, in terms of video, you mentioned, we're seeing that certainly in the number of Prime members that are subscribing. And so that has some short-term impact, the great long-term impact as we retain those Prime members and as they start to do more cross-shopping over time. We have a lot of investment in front of that demand, if you will. So those are some of the things that I would call out to be try to be helpful.\nOperator: We'll move now to Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nYoussef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald: Going back to $100 million spend on the original content, you mentioned earlier as that part of the business grows, is there any reason to believe that the amount of spend on the originals will go down? The assumption here is it'll only go up. So is that $100 million a good level to work off of? And then going back to the Fire Phone, just trying to understand the strategy around the product longer term. Is it again just to try to further build the Amazon ecosystem with all the benefits or do you think this could be a cell phone of the business?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the original content, we're not giving guidance on the numbers going forward and beyond Q3. We're very excited about what we see and the pilots we had and the series we had. And so we're very happy to green-light the series that we've talked about and released over the past few months. We're also happy you'll be seeing many new pilots. And so that's reflected in the over $100 million that I mentioned earlier. So we're extremely excited on behalf of customers to be able to do that, and we think that's a great thing to do. But in terms of what we do in terms of spend beyond Q3, can't comment on today. In terms of the Fire Phone, we're very excited about it. You mentioned two different areas. One is can it exist on its own and whether it's part of our family, if you will, to help drive other usage. And the answer is we certainly think it can be both. So we think it could be a great product on its own. We're very excited to offer it to customers. It's very integrated into our various digital services including video and games and our app store and ebooks and certainly Prime music. So those are all very interesting things on behalf of customers. It's also a great way to do physical shopping as well. So again, it's certainly integrated into our business as well.\nOperator: And Brian Nowak with SIG has our next question.\nBrian Nowak - SIG: The first one is around CPG, consumer packaged goods, I was wondering, Tom, can you talk to us some learnings in CPG so far, what's working and what you think is still holding back faster CPG adoption? Do you think you need a same-day delivering offering at this point for CPG kind of given Google and even the traditional retailers push into that category? And then the second one, the close to 90% AWS usage growth, just help us understand a bit more, what did that number look like in 2013?\nTom Szkutak: Yeah, in terms of the usage growth, the business is growing very, very fast beyond the data point. There's not a lot I can help you with. In terms of CPG, and this really relates to many of our categories, we're working on behalf of customers to provide fast delivery. It's something that we've improved on over the years and we're going to continue to work on. There's a number of different things we're working on. One of the things that I mentioned early in the call is certainly sortation centers. That's an attempt on our side. We have in a small way and tested it and we've seen that it's a way to get product to customers even faster. So we're excited about that. It also helps deliver on Sunday, which we think is great too. So again, those are the things that we're working on as well as others to help customers get product faster. And we think that benefits CPG products as well other products.\nOperator: We'll move next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets: I wanted to follow up on that William Blair question about gross margins only because I know you don't focus on and there're a lot of mix factors that you correctly pointed out. But that's a record high gross margin for you, 30.7%, ever. And it's in the context of a quarter in which AWS clearly came in because of the price cuts. And so there's something else that happened there that really caused that gross margin to gap up. Could you give us any color? I understand there're a lot of puts and takes in there. But something must have happened that was unusual to have that kind of result with a slowing down AWS contribution.\nTom Szkutak: We don't focus a lot on gross margin of the business. Obviously unusual product lines, we would look at gross margin. But across the business, we don't for the very reason you mentioned. There's a large mix impact. You have our Web Services business. You have our third-party business. You have the retail business. You have categories within retail. There's a whole host of things that would impact that. And so that's why we don't focus on a total company basis. Certainly on individual SKUs or ASINs, as we call them, we certainly would look at it. Individual sub-categories, we would certainly look at it internally. But from a total company perspective, given the mix effects, we think it's much more appropriate to look at operating profit and free cash flow.\nOperator: And from ISI Group, we'll go to Greg Melich.\nGreg Melich - ISI Group: Looked like revenue per active customer accelerated again this quarter, up over 5%. It was running closer to 2% to 3% last year. Could you help us understand what's driving that, whether it's Prime particularly, or any color on that? And when you gave the Prime numbers second quarter more sign-ups whether that was a grosser in that number?\nTom Szkutak: The Prime, it was a net number. So that's the net additions to total members. So again, we added net more Prime members in Q2 of this year versus Q2 last year, even with the price change. In terms of revenue per active customer, there's not a lot I can say there. A few things to think about, one is certainly Prime customers buy more than non-Prime customers. And we're seeing great growth on Prime. That's certainly having an impact on that number. And certainly there'll be other factors too. Our Web Services business would be included in the numerator that you're talking about as well. And so those are factors you should be thinking about. But again, the biggest factor would certainly be in terms of looking at our retail business, Prime is becoming much more meaningful. And that's also why we think about how do we make Prime better on behalf of those customers. We just like the long-term benefits that we see for those customers.\nOperator: And our final question today will be from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company.\nColin Sebastian - Robert Baird & Company: One of your executives in the UK recently mentioned the company's goal of reaching 1 billion different products available for sale on the site. I wonder if there is an expansion in selection beyond what we've seen recently that could help accelerate growth. And related to that, are you still relatively agnostic in terms of the split between first and third-party unit sales?\nTom Szkutak: In terms of selection, I would say nothing is new here. We're going to continue to add unique selection. That's something that we've been working extremely hard day-in and day-out over many years. We have a great team of people working on that and trying to make sure we get a vast selection. So that's something that we're pleased about. In terms of the margins, they do approximate each other. Obviously there's some differences. Some of the third-party will be used products. And you shouldn't assume that a used product necessarily has the same contribution profit per unit as a new unit, things like that. But they're close approximates of those.\nPhil Hardin: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: And again, that will conclude today's conference.

LLC  \nOperator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2014 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. In addition, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And now for opening remarks, I will turn the conference over to Senior Manager of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead, sir.\nDave Fildes:  Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, April 24, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak:  Thanks, Dave. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 26% to $5.35 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.49 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $3.85 billion. We continue to make additional investments in support of business growth consisting of investments and technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital is 9%, up from 1%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 476 million shares compared with 471 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.74 billion or 23% excluding the $10 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $5.47 billion, up 8% or 8% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.02 billion, up 27% or 27% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer accounts exceeded 244 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units. Now I\u2019ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.06 billion or 71.2% of revenue, compared with 73.4%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $5.18 billion or 26.2% of sales, up approximately 240 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.24 billion or 11.3% of revenue, compared with 10.8%. Tech and content was $1.82 billion or 9.2% of revenue, compared with 7.9%. Marketing was $843 million or 4.3% of revenue, compared with 3.8%. Now I\u2019ll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $11.86 billion. Media revenue grew 12% to $2.82 billion or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $7.83 billion, representing 66% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 60% to $1.2 billion. North America segment operating income increased 23% to $562 million, a 4.7% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.88 billion. Adjusting for the $24 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 18%. Media revenue grew 4% to $2.64 billion, or 4% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 27% to $5.19 billion or 26% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 66% of International revenues, up from 61%. International segment operating loss was $60 million, compared with $16 million loss in the prior period. CSOI increased 14% to $502 million or 2.5% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 10%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 19% to $146 million or 0.7% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $73 million. GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with $82 million and $0.18 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $771 million year-over-year to $8.67 billion. Inventory increased 24% to $6.72 billion and inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.5 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 19% to $10.59 billion and accounts payable days were 68 consistent with the prior year. I\u2019ll conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q2 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.1 billion and $19.8 billion or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 160 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $455 million loss and $55 million loss, compared to $79 million in income in the second quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $455 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between zero and $400 million, compared to $409 million in the second quarter of 2013. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. With that, Dave, let\u2019s move to questions.\nDave Fildes: Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: Absolutely, Mr. Fildes. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll hear first from Mark Miller with William Blair.\nMark R. Miller \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC:  Hi Tom. I was hoping you could maybe just layout first, what do you think the main reasons are for the acceleration and growth here in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. And then a specific question on Prime Pantry, it is one of motivations to get the customer on that program it might make get easier to convert them to Amazon Fresh. And if so, would you want to run this operation as a breakeven like you do with Kindle, to enable a bigger business, thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak:  In terms of growth, we saw very solid growth, very good growth in Q1, up 23% on a local currency basis. North-America we saw a similar growth rates in Q1 as we saw in Q4 of last year as well as Q1 of last year all at 26%. And then international we saw the growth accelerate a little bit on a exchange adjusted basis from 15% to 18% from Q4 to Q1. But we really seen is we are pleased with the overall fundamentals we continue to add new customers and stocks continues to be healthy, third party unit is a percentage of units are above 40% still very strong FBA adoption, that continues to be strong around the world, continued to add new selection. We saw strong growth in many different areas including Web Services, and so again a lot of different areas contributed to growth rate that we saw in Q1. In terms of Prime Pantry, we just think it\u2019s an exciting option for prime numbers that\u2019s available only to prime numbers, and so they can get their everyday non-bulk items in one box, and we think that\u2019s \u2013 its\u2019 interesting for customers and again it\u2019s great way that we can add the selection and have the selections for those customers.\nOperator: Moving on to Aram Robinson with Wolfe Research.\nAram H. Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, thanks for taking the question. On the famous drone interview that Jeff had with Charlie Rose, he said something that caught my attention, which was that every elasticity study that you do says that Amazon should be raising prices. I have two questions around that. The first is does that equation also work in reverse? Meaning that if higher questions don\u2019t dampen demand, does it also mean that lower prices don\u2019t stimulate demand like they used to?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of pricing, we\u2019ve been very consistent. We want to offer great value to customers, and so I would work very hard to make sure that we can offer and afford to offer great prices for customers. And so, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working on in the very hard over the years and that\u2019s certainly one of the reason why you\u2019ve seen the growth rates that we\u2019ve experienced a long with getting close to customers, from the shipping perspective make sure we have great in stocks and other service attributes. In terms of price increases, we certainly have increased the price on Prime, but again that was after many years of not raising the price even though the cost of transportation costs certainly had gone up and the fact that we have certainly added a lot of selection going from little over 1 million items in the first year to over 20 million items. So it\u2019s still an incredibly great value for customers and that\u2019s why we did that. So again, we\u2019re all about making sure we have great values for customers and we\u2019ll continue to that.\nAram H. Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC: Okay thanks for that.\nOperator: Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein has the next question.\nCarlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, thank you. I have two quick questions about AWS. First, I think everyone would agree that AWS is a vast opportunity. So given how large the opportunity is, why is it that you are not hiring more people, launching more products, and growing faster? What are the limiting factors for growth of AWS? Second, you have a long history of cutting prices for a few specific AWS products, but you did something somewhat unusual in late March when you cut prices across EC2 and S3 products in one shot. Why did you only cut your prices after Google cut theirs? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak:   In terms of AWS, the team is doing a fantastic job. We are adding a lot of resources that we\u2019ve grown our employee-based there dramatically over the years and continue to add people there. And that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve been able to launch all the new services that we had over the past several years. And we continued the pace of acceleration in terms of new things that we\u2019re doing is increasing and we\u2019ve published a lot of statistics around that. In terms of pricing, we think this is our 42nd pricing increase that we had in AWS. Sorry price decrease in AWS and we\u2019re very excited behalf of customers to be able to do that. The team works very hard to able to afford those lower prices and we\u2019re excited to do that. And so in terms of the timing of when we launched these price decreases, they come at different times and that happened to come in the presentation that we\u2019re giving around that time. So but again we\u2019re excited about the opportunity and we\u2019re continuing invest in that business, given the big opportunity that we have there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.\nBen Schachter \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.:  Can you walk us through the process on how you think about and how you model, how much you\u2019re willing to pay for exclusive content such as video or video game content. And another question, it looks fair for us to assume that the business model of the Kindle Fire TV is similar to what Bezos has said regarding selling other hardware roughly break even and then making money on the F consumer unit. Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak:  In terms of video content, the team does a very nice job of various modeling, certainly we are trying to estimate what the usages of those of all the content that we\u2019ve launched. And we have a number of different ways if you do that. We do have certainly for some of the content that we have been selling both in terms of physical format as well as selling on the transactional side. We certainly see what the \u2013 what those sales are, what those unit sales are. So we have that as a benchmark, we also have other models to look at that to help us guide to we think the usage that will be those. But again the team has done a nice job and I am looking at different ways to model that. And I expect it will continue to refine that overtime as well.\nBen Schachter \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.: And the Kindle Fire TV.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes, in terms of Fire TV, I can\u2019t talk about the economics of the device itself. But what I can say is it\u2019s very early and we are extremely pleased with what see and just the few weeks here and the team certainly made we think it\u2019s a killer product and where the team is very hard trying to keep buying stock in their product.\nOperator: And City\u2019s Mark May have the next question.\nMark A. May \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Thank you. why don\u2019t you if noticed any change and sign ups or conversions in the few weeks here since you\u2019ve rolled out the prime price increase for new customers and if you could maybe comment on the what may have contributed to the deceleration and year\u2013on-year our growth and media sales in North America. Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of prime, it\u2019s early but we are encouraged with what we see so far. Just over the last several weeks, our prime subscribers continue to grow week-over-week. New trials, the adoption of new trials again post the increase are growing very nicely. So those customers accepting new trials is growing very fast. We only have a few days of information related to conversion. And we are encouraged by what we see there. So overall we are very encouraged and the reason why is the customers we believe are responding to just a great service. And so we are continuously being reminded that for customers in terms of the offering we have in the physical side as well as the offerings that we have in the digital side as well. So we are very encouraged there. In terms of the North American media, we did see from a growth standpoint, it\u2019s 13%year-over-year for North American media that compares to 14% in Q1 of last year. It is down a little bit sequentially from Q4 \u2013 Q4 keep in mind we do have video games and video consoles in that number in Q4. And there is certainly number of different factors, but that certainly one that is impacting the Q4 numbers. And it\u2019s certainly seasonal as you would expect that there is some great launches of consoles in Q4 that are impacting that number.\nOperator:  We\u2019ll now turn to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas T. Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC:  Great. Thanks for taking the question. Tom, I was just hoping you could give us your view on units growth and how you think about that going forward. How important of a metrics it is because we\u2019re seeing somewhat of a decoupling here as revenue and gross profit reaccelerated, but units obviously (indiscernible) as media came down. Can you talk a little bit about that? Thank you. \nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure as you mentioned unit growth was actually decelerated a little bit from Q4 and also from last year with 23% year-over-year in Q1. One thing to keep in mind is that our web services business is growing at a faster rate. We don\u2019t incorporate any units from AWS in that metric. But overall, you\u2019re right we continue to \u2013 from a growth standpoint we had a small acceleration of growth from Q4 to Q1 from a revenue standpoint, again on local currency basis going from 22% to 23%, we are very pleased with the fundamentals that I talked about earlier that\u2019s impacting that growth rate. So again overall we are pleased and again we think that we see a nice growth rate, and third-party units as a percentage of total units is 40%, which was consistent with what we saw last year so, third-party growth continues to be very strong as well.\nOperator:  Brian Nowak, SIG has the next question.\nBrian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thanks. I have two. The first one, just Tom to go back to the unit question, even if we exclude North America and international other from gross profit. Gross profit growth held in there pretty steady at 28%. Just kind of curious, is there anything that we should think about of why gross profit growth and unit growth is decoupling? And is unit growth a really good way to measure the health of the business? And then the second one is on international media. One of the factors you guys have flagged in the past holding down international media is more limited local language content. Can you just help us better quantify the difference in English language digital content compared to foreign language? And what steps are you taking to improve that?\nThomas J. Szkutak:  In terms of the \u2013 I\u2019ll take the second part of the question first about International media, the growth rate was 4% in the quarter and as I\u2019ve talked about in prior quarters, certainly one of the things that\u2019s happening is we see a conversion from physical to digital. And for example in North-America we are now selling North-America media. We are now selling more digital units than physical units. So over the past twelve months we sold more digital units than physical units. We are not at that point yet in International and so certainly that\u2019s an opportunity for us as we look at growing International media. So again, it\u2019s certainly something that we are working very hard on and certainly a good opportunity for us. In terms of unit growth, it\u2019s certainly just one measure that we want to \u2013 that we\u2019ve thought has been helpful. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve continued to provide it. It is just one metric, we have many different metrics that we are sharing. But that much more I can add to that but again it\u2019s a metric, was there a third part of the question.\nBrian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP:  No I guess, just are there any other puts and takes we should think about in units as we go throughout the year where there are tough compares or easy compares in units from a digital unit perspective or anything?\nThomas J. Szkutak:  It\u2019s not that I can think of at the minute. But just keep in mind when you think about our revenue growth always be thinking about there\u2019s certainly a volume component. We have a third-party component, we have a mix component. We\u2019re continuously trading the lower prices for customers. All those factor into the revenue growth rates that you see into the revenue metrics that we provide to you.\nBrian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now hear from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.\nBrian J. Pitz \u2013 Jefferies LLC:  Great, thanks. Regarding fulfillment, does it make sense for you to bring some of the components in-house? We\u2019ve been hearing talk of your own fulfillment network. Can you make any comments on this? And just to follow-up on your digital units point, can you comment on any impact of recent shifts in music and video consumption to subscription based models, from download to own on your media business? Is that having any impact? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak:  In terms of fulfillment, there\u2019s not a lot I can comment on in terms of your specific question. What I would say though is we continue to work to be, as we have over the years, to become closer and closer to customers. And so, we\u2019ve certainly done that in a number of different ways. Just the footprint we have from a fulfillment capacity standpoint enables us to be closer to customers and getting great selection even closer to customers. So we continue to work. Certainly Prime was another way to get a faster delivery speed to customers and so we\u2019ll continue to work on our capabilities there to make it even better over time. In terms of the digital units question, I apologize. There\u2019s not a lot I can comment in terms of your specific question there.\nBrian J. Pitz \u2013 Jefferies LLC: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll move on to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Tom, we look back at your model and we go back to 2008 and 2009. In the middle of a pretty bad global recession, you were able to put up 7.3% and 7.4% operating margins in international. And now it looks like you\u2019re losing money and maybe for the whole year. Could you talk about some of the drivers that are driving the losses this quarter internationally? What the Company\u2019s patience for losses are internationally. And when you come out of this, how your business will be different and what your margin outlook is for the international profits? Thank you.\nTom A. Alberg:  Sure. In terms of what you\u2019re seeing in Q1, and you\u2019ve been seeing this certainly for a few year period here is we\u2019ve investing very heavily in international and we\u2019re doing that in a number of different ways. Certainly from a geographic standpoint, we continue to invest in new geographies, and Italy and Spain were certainly the most recent and you should assume that we\u2019re investing in those geographies. We continue to invest in China and certainly that\u2019s in investment mode. And then also as we\u2019ve continue to grow in international, we\u2019ve invested in terms of capacity, both fulfillment capacity, as well as infrastructure capacity to support those. So what you saw \u2013 you will see some certainly variation over time in the period that you\u2019re talking about. We certainly had particularly coming out of \u2013 going into late 2008 and also 2009, we had extra capacity globally. We still did continue to invest, but not near the rates that we\u2019re investing now and that\u2019s why you saw some results that you\u2019ve seen. But again one of the things that you see now in international but in our total results is continue to invest very heavily into the business because of the opportunities that we are seeing.\nJustin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now hear from Greg Melich with ISI Group.\nGreg Melich \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC:  Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a bit on the decision process that you went through when raising the Prime membership fee. I know you talked about potentially doing $20 to $40. What factors did you look at in deciding on the $20? And related to that, with the deleveraging of shipment costs happening a little bit, was weather an impact on that or is that just the business and how it\u2019s trending?\nThomas J. Szkutak:  There was a number of different factors that we have looked at in terms of when we look at the price increase, but the biggest one is we had build \u2013 we think we build a great service and we saw that the just particularly the transportation cost since its inception have grown dramatically, we just haven\u2019t done any price increase during that long time period, and that\u2019s really the big reason why we decides to do that. We\u2019ve launched the program with over a million items. And we have over 20 million items customers are using that service in addition to having the transportation cost being higher they are using that service more and that\u2019s really we applied to it. And it would be on that, there is a lot we can comment.\nGreg Melich \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: Just on the shipment costs deleveraging in the first quarter a little bit. Did weather or something else have an impact, or is that just the trend of the business given the growth rate of shipments?\nThomas J. Szkutak:  This many different factors that go into that and certainly, weather would have been one of those.\nOperator:  We\u2019ll move on to Ron Josey with JMP Securities.\nRon Victor Josey \u2013:  Hi guys, thanks for taking the question this is Andrew on for Ron. Quick question around streaming volumes in UK and Germany now that Lovefilm is bundled with Prime? Guys you have any comment?\nJMP Securities LLC:  Hi guys, thanks for taking the question this is Andrew on for Ron. Quick question around streaming volumes in UK and Germany now that Lovefilm is bundled with Prime? Guys you have any comment?\nThomas J. Szkutak:  Unfortunately it is probably a good question for future quarters it just so early and again what little data we have so far it\u2019s very encouraging but it is very early so I think that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a good question for future quarters.\nOperator:  We\u2019ll move to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\nHeath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Great thanks, obviously a lot of focus on pricing in AWS you are clearly still seeing accelerating growth despite those cuts, could you provide some context on the volume side of that equation whether it\u2019s just growth in customers or workload some way to sort of frame the other side of things outside of just pricing in AWS?\nThomas J. Szkutak:  It\u2019s a good question. And I think that something we can certainly work on and tried to be helpful the price change, the most recent price change is certain recent. And what we are commenting on is certainly the Q1 results but \u2013 that something that we\u2019ll think about and that would be helpful on that as we go forward. But certainly usage has been this is not something recent. Usage has been very, very strong. And as we\u2019ve continued to lower prices over time, this is the 42nd price decrease that we\u2019ve had and we\u2019ve had a great usage growth over time.\nHeath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And just on the AWS side, with the sort of nationalistic concerns that we\u2019re seeing around stored data, does that change at all the way that the AWS team is thinking about infrastructure needs for that business or the way that you might be thinking about CapEx?\nThomas J. Szkutak:  I think the best way to say it is, and hopefully this answers your question. The team focuses on many different aspects, but certainly the operational aspects of being up and running, being a very secure, reliable set of services, those are something the team is very focused on and spends a lot of time working on. And so beyond that, I\u2019m not sure I can add to it.\nHeath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald has the next question.\nYoussef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Yes. Thank you very much. Two quick questions please. First, the HBO deal seems like a seminal event for Prime video in terms of quality and probably the price bit as well. Is this the first of many potentially large deals you\u2019re intent on getting for the platform? Or was this more of an opportunistic transaction that just came your way? And second, just on the P&L, can you just clarify where that $60 million in investment gains came from, please?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. The answer to your second question, which is down below in other relates to a gain primarily from Living Social. They sold their Korean business and that\u2019s reflected in that line item. In terms of the content question, the way we think about it is this. Since we launched the service we\u2019ve continually added \u2013 tried to add great content and I think we\u2019ve been pretty successful in doing that. And this is just another contract that we\u2019ve launched into this multi-year to do that and we think it\u2019s great for customers. We\u2019re extremely excited to offer this to customers and we\u2019ll try to keep making the service even better over time.\nYoussef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities:  Is exclusive video an important consideration for you now?\nThomas J. Szkutak: There\u2019s a number of factors. Certainly we have a number of different arrangements where we have exclusive content and we think that\u2019s great for customers. We\u2019ve also supplemented with other content that\u2019s not exclusive. And we\u2019re obviously, as you know, we\u2019re working on original content as well. So that is exclusive. So those are the things that we\u2019re working on and we see the customer response to all of those and we like what we see.\nYoussef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thanks\nOperator:  Scott Tilghman with B. Riley has the next question.\nRonald Scott Tilghman \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Hi Tom, wanted to really ask two related questions. First, following up on the international discussion from before, I was wondering if you could prioritize where the investments are going on the international side between fulfillment, media build out, geography build out, et cetera? And then related, I haven\u2019t seen any discussion on what\u2019s happening on the domestic fulfillment build out this year. I was wondering if you could comment on that as well.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Yes, in terms of the priority, I\u2019m not sure what to add there, but I would say that we\u2019re investing heavily in China and we have been for some time and certainly that\u2019s a factor. We\u2019re investing in new geographies, most notably Italy and Spain. We\u2019re investing in, as I mentioned, fulfillment centers and infrastructure to support that growth. So, again, not a lot to add there. The other part of your question?\nRonald Scott Tilghman \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC: Well, let me ask you in a different way. If you look at pricing, if you look at infrastructure, if you look at geography, is there one bucket that tends to trump the others?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Again we\u2019ve been pretty consistent how we\u2019ve talked about it. Again, China is an issue. China is a big investment. In all of our geographies, not just international, we\u2019re investing on behalf of customers in terms of lowering prices. And so, that\u2019s having an impact, volume is having an impact. We continue to invest in fulfillment capacity not only for our retail customers, but also for third-parties on behalf of fulfillment by Amazon, sort of making investments there and the others that I mentioned.\nRonald Scott Tilghman \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC: Fair enough. And on domestic fulfillment?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Domestic fulfillment, as we have in past years, we\u2019ll continue to update you as we go throughout the year. I don\u2019t have any comments today given that we\u2019re just coming out of Q1, but we will be adding fulfillment capacity given the growth rates we\u2019re experiencing and we\u2019ll update you as we go.\nRonald Scott Tilghman \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from Eric Sheridan with UBS.\nEric J. Sheridan \u2013 UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. A question about your advertising business. There\u2019s been a lot of movement by Google to push PLAs as a product to sellers. I want to know longer term as you guys think about both advertising on Amazon, and also to give out advertising in a way that would allow sellers to bring traffic back to their own websites that might avail themselves of Amazon\u2019s advertising data and user data to help enable those sales. Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: I can\u2019t comment on what we might or might not do in the future, but the team has done a nice job from an advertising perspective and you can see those prominently on our various websites. We view it as another way certainly to help, be able to afford lower prices for customers and again the team has done a very nice job of monetizing those detailed pages to allow us to be able to do that.\nOperator: Moving on to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark S. Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC:  Thanks, Tom. Two questions, please. The international media you talked about, I guess the digitization catch-up or whatever of international media. Could you break that down a little bit further? Are there certain categories, i.e., books versus videos, versus music that one of those is dragging internationally? And what is it that needs to happen for that digital shift to occur? Do you need more rights? You just need more devices in the market? What\u2019s the drag there? And then, in terms of the operating income guidance you\u2019re very consistent how you guided the last couple of years. It seems like you\u2019re guiding for more of a sequential decline in operating income in June quarter than you have the last two years. Is that just a different type of seasonality to the business, or are there new near-term investments that you\u2019re making in this June quarter? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak:  In terms of the second part of the question, related to the guidance what\u2019s reflected in the Q2 guidance is many different factors, but we are investing. I\u2019ve mentioned a number of different investments that we\u2019re making in International which related to Q1, also relate to Q2. We are investing in content, we are investing in our web services business both from new services as well as pricing. So again, we are investing in a lot of different areas across the company. So I\u2019m sure there is a number that I\u2019m not mentioning. So again, we are investing, that\u2019s really which we are seeing in the range of guidance that we see in Q2. In terms of International media, we continue to make progress there on our conversion from physical to digital. But we\u2019re just not where we are in North America. And it\u2019s in many different categories and we\u2019ll continue to work on that. And certainly some other things that you see related to video in Europe, certainly trying to address that part of that. So again, we\u2019ll continue to work on the various pieces of that for our International business and look forward to doing that.\nMark S. Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator:  Deutsche Bank\u2019s Ross Sandler has the next question.\nRoss A. Sandler \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  Hey, guys. If you don\u2019t mind I\u2019ll beat the dead horse on the International question. But specifically around China, can you just give us an update on the overall strategy for China? Are the levels of investments going into the country accelerating or are they just stable? And then what kinds of milestones in terms of market share or customer adoption do you guys track to identify success or return on that investment? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In China, we are investing a lot and trying to grow the business there. We are certainly investing in fulfillment. We haven\u2019t been investing in our fulfillment network to get even closer to customers. We are doing a lot on the retail basics as we\u2019ve done in other geographies making sure that we have a great in stock availability. We\u2019re making sure that we have [had] a unique selection. So those are the, lot of the things that we\u2019ve done making sure that we have the right pricing in place on behalf of customers making sure that our service levels are where we need them to be. So those are the things that we\u2019d continue to work on in China. It\u2019s a very large opportunity and we are continuing to work hard. Is it a large investment? Yes it is. And that investment has certainly increased over the past several years.\nOperator:  We\u2019ll now hear from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company.\nColin A. Sebastian \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Thanks. First, just one clarification on the AWS question. Given the comments that customers would see hundreds of millions of dollars of savings in Q2 from the price cuts, I just want to understand or clarify if we should be expecting moderating growth rate in the other segments, at least temporarily? And then lastly just Amazon\u2019s position on the ability of ISPs to add a toll for fastlane network access. Is this a scenario a situation that would change the company\u2019s approach or strategy with regards to video or is this more of a non-factor for you guys? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the just clarification and just quote, he mentioned that customers will be saving hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several months alone, he didn\u2019t say specifically at the second quarter. So certainly that\u2019s impacting second quarter and it\u2019s reflected in the guidance that you are seeing there. But again we are very happy to do that on behalf of our AWS customers. We\u2019ve done many different price decreases over time and we think that\u2019s great on behalf of customers and we think our teams are and we are positioned very well in that business and we continue to invest in that given the large opportunity that we have there. In terms of the other question, there is not really a lot I can comment there.\nOperator:  And ladies and gentlemen unfortunately we only have time for one more question which will come from Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.\nKerry Rice \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC:  Thanks a lot. Just a couple questions. One on customer adds, you didn\u2019t add quite as many new customer accounts as you did in Q1 2013. And so I assume based on your comments that wasn\u2019t related to the price increase around Prime, and so I don\u2019t know if you can add any context there. And then the second question is just around mobile. Obviously, the mobilization throughout the world is an important trend and you guys haven\u2019t talked a lot about it. Wonder if you can give us any context around your strategy there or any metrics.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of Prime, again over the year-over-year, it is growing very rapidly and then also week-over-week as we look at the metrics over the last several weeks continues to grow week-over-week, so we\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing there. In terms of mobile, it\u2019s certainly a tailwind for our business. We have a number of different things that are working on mobile and we continue to make it easier and easier for customers to shop from a mobile perspective. Our traffic continues to increase from a mobile perspective. We are excited about what we see there. And we continue trying to find ways to make that even better from an experience standpoint for our customers. \nDave Fildes: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator:  And again ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.\nPhil Hardin: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, January 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-months operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principle repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principle repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million. Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue, compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue, compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 5.1%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international, and Amazon web services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million, compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share. Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%. Japan revenue grew 19%, and UK revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion. Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 [ph] million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, compared with $178 million in the prior year. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion. And inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter of 2015. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion, compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015. We are grateful to our customers and remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first, is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.\nPhil Hardin: Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from analyst Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Ju: Hey, thanks. So Brian, I think in the past you've given some indication as to what usage growth may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter. And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. We'll say we're - it's been very strong. And AWS revenue is on a, just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4. As far as pricing is concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years ago. And generally what we find is that price is important. But so is speed and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that were beneficial to them. I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015 and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel we have a lead in this space and we don't take it for granted and we want to serve customers better each year.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from analyst Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Helfstein: Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics in fourth quarter eCommerce, particularly in the US? Did we see more aggressive promotional activity and maybe talk about how you tried to work that to continue to drive the Prime number of members going forward? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Well, what I can say is our approach to pricing has not changed. And through Q4 [ph] we did everything we could to have the best prices available for customers and in stock in time for the holiday. Another dynamic of Q4 was that it was a huge FBA quarter, nearly 50% of our third party units were FBA and our third party units were also up to 47% of our paid units, up 400 basis points year-over-year. So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses and we were full. It was a very busy quarter and it did increase some of our variable costs as a result, primarily in the US, but a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded our - even our expectations.\nJason Helfstein: Perhaps how are you able to integrate that into holiday promotions?\nBrian Olsavsky: I'm sorry. You cut off there. Could you repeat your question?\nJason Helfstein: Sure. Just any additional color around Prime and how you were able to integrate that into holiday promotions?\nBrian Olsavsky: Nothing specific. I will say, you know, one interesting enhancement this year was our Prime Now service, which allowed people order in selected markets up until 11.59 on New Year, excuse me, Christmas Eve. So that was a valuable service to many late shoppers, last-minute shoppers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAram Rubinson: Hey. Thanks very much. Two questions both on the logistics side. It seems pretty clear that you guys are trafficking in some old world assets, like truck trailers and ship lanes and air fields. Can you help give us a sense as to maybe what we're trying to accomplish with that, if it's defensive to protect your service to your existing customers or if you're looking to maybe start new businesses with those assets?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Aram. Thanks for your question. I would say what we've found is in order to serve \u2013 properly serve our customers at peak. We've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners. That's not meant to replace them. And those carriers are just not - no longer able to handle all of our capacity that we need at peak. They have been and continue to be great partners. And we look forward to working with them in the future. It's just we've had to add some resources on our own. You mentioned trucks. The Amazon trucks, we did invest in those - this past year. We use those primarily for movement between our warehouses and our source centers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two. The first one is just on gross margins. I think they were down of about 200 basis points sequentially. It's the biggest fall in the fourth quarter in quite sometime. Anything you call out there, is the devices are more - sortation center, is anything pressuring gross margins we should think about in the fourth quarter? And then on the fulfillment line, you mentioned FBA being a big driver of the growth in the fulfillment costs. Anything else you would call out leading to incremental fulfillment costs, maybe India or something else? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: No. And again, keep in mind that the fulfillment as a percent of revenue is impacted by the calculation of FBA revenue being a net number as opposed to a full revenue number. But our fulfillment costs per unit actually decreased year-over-year. It just we are now shipping more and more of our, other demand out of our warehouses, because of the strength in retail and FBA. On gross margin, I would - first I'll caution you and say, we would encourage you to look at free cash flow, which was \u2013 grew at minimum of $4 billion on each of the metrics that we point out and our profit which was up 88% year-over-year. If you look sequentially, also keep in mind that in Q3 when it was up 500 basis points year-over-year, that was lapping the write-down of our Amazon phone [ph] inventory the prior year. So there is a little bit of noise in the Q3 number. But generally, again, we're happy with the ability to service customers, the reaction of customers in Q4, and the bottom line results that we had.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.\nColin Sebastian: Great, thanks. One follow-up and then another question. On the logistics and transportation side, I was curious if that's to date just to supplement some of the other carriers. But more broadly or longer term, is there an ambition from the services side to perhaps provide capacity to other companies. And then on AWS margins, I was just wondering if we should expect more leverage there going forward and whether Q1, whether that should demonstrate some seasonality versus what we've seen in terms of sequential growth in prior years? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me work backwards. We don't give guidance by segment. So we cannot really comment on AWS specifically in Q1. And the operational improvements, excuse me, the gross margin, operating margin year-over-year that we've seen in the AWS business has been heavily driven by operating efficiencies, both purchase reductions and purchase prices and also efficiency in driving greater utilization of the assets that we have. So we're very happy with that. Keep in mind that we did have a - although the year-over-year increase in capital expenditures and capital leases was not as great as we saw in 2013 to 2014, we did spend over $9 billion on those, on capital expenditures and capital lease obligations, up from prior year was, excuse me\u2026\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question\u2026\nBrian Olsavsky: Sorry, let me finish my answer to him, please. We grew up \u2013 we grew from in the $5 billion range in 2013 to $8.9 billion in 2014 and now over $9 billion in 2015.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Senna with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Senna: Hi. So lot of headlines around Amazon's activity at Sundance I just was hoping you could maybe expand once more on the video strategy and specifically are you seeing an inflection in Prime Video usage. And maybe just also on your streaming partners program, what the general reception is like? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. We're very thrilled with the customer response to Prime Video. Again, when Prime Video is used by our Prime members, it drives adoption and retention, higher free trial conversion rates, and higher renewal rates for subscribers. So what we were encouraged by in Q4 was that globally we doubled the number of \u2013 our Prime members doubled the number of viewing hours of the Prime Video year-over-year. And internationally, we had twice as member Prime members streaming year-over-year. So very encouraged by the pickup and the response of customers. The other comment I would say about video is we're very happy with the Amazon Studios content, in particular. We've had some great success in 2014 and 2015. As you probably know, Transparent has won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys, both for actors and for the show itself. Mozart in the Jungle just won two Golden Globe Awards. So very, very pleased with the critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios content and we've got a lot of new content coming out this year. Catastrophe Season 2, Bosch Season 2, we're all looking forward to. And in February, we will have Chi-Raq, our first original movie that we got to work with Spike Lee on, which won many critical, made many critics' best film list in 2015. That will be coming to Prime Video in February.\nPhil Hardin: Just to add, this is Phil. On the question about the streaming partners program, so that's our new over the top streaming subscription program for Prime Members. We think it's a really convenient way for them to access additional content, content sources like Showtime and Starz. And it's really early, so it's just out of the gate. But we've been very pleased with what we've seen so far.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney: Two things, please. Any callouts on the macro side? Occasionally you called things out, anything this time? And then can you talk a little bit about Amazon business, I know, there is a little bit of a line in the press release on it. I know you've had this for a couple of years. But any indications to materiality of that, the kind of momentum it's gaining, the kind of traction it's gaining? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. No macroeconomic comments. Again, we feel we're very encouraged by the customer response to our offerings in Q4. Amazon business, yes, in April you may remember we launched it as a marketplace with specific features and benefits for businesses. That - Amazon business now serves more than 200,000 businesses from small organizations to Fortune 500 companies. So it's still early, but we're encouraged and we think we're creating some value, a lot of value for our business customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMark May: Thanks. Brian, question on international retail business. I think you added well over a billion in revenue year-on-year in the quarter, but from a CSOI perspective, you really didn't see any improvement there. I'm sure there is, there are a lot of different things going on. I just wondered if you could unpack that a little bit and give us a sense of, you know, what profitability looks like maybe in some of your more mature, established countries and regions, relative to the investments you were making in other countries, so that we can kind of get a better picture of what's actually going on under the hood there? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. Thanks for your question. We are very pleased by the international growth, 22% FX neutral, was up 1000 basis points year-over-year. We saw that the - we told you the Prime growth, Prime membership growth of 50% in-- excuse me, 51% globally, 47% in the US means that the international Prime programs grew at a faster clip than that. So very pleased with the up-tick. We rolled out a lot of additional Prime features internationally as well this year, from FREE Same-Day to Prime Now to Prime Music and Prime Video in Japan, to name a few. So very happy with that. But in general, if I step back, our investments in national are twofold. First, there's the Prime platform and all the features that I just mentioned, including the fulfillment, adding more fulfillment resources to handle higher and higher retail volumes and very strong FBA program as well. And then the remainder - the biggest other investment area is obviously India. And we like \u2013 we continue to see, like what we see in India. In Q4 Amazon India was the top e-commerce site in India throughout the very busy diwali shopping season, including the shopping season, according to comScore. And sales by sellers in Q4 were greater than all of 2014 combined in Q4. So seeing great progress with downloads, innovations for sellers and customers alike. And we like the ramp there and we're continuing to invest in India.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Two things. Just first, on the North America EGM growth, if you could just talk about the 28% there and the decel on an easier comp and whether there's any particular factors within that we should be thinking about and perhaps if there was any weather and apparel impact there? And then second, last quarter, and I don't want to misquote you, but you said something along the lines of being able to invest as you'd like and also deliver good profit and that the pendulum wouldn't swing as far perhaps as it has in the past. Is that statement and thought still hold as you head into '16? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with EGM. So EGM growth, North America EGM growth of 28% was actually also the highest in the last 4 years. So we're happy with that. The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate, revenue growth rate. So sequentially last year, any North America EGM we dropped from 31% to 27%. This year, it's 35% to 28%. So there is always a - generally a sequential drop in Q4. But certainly very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well, total customer satisfaction. Your other question, investments. Yes. We continue to have healthy investments as we've stated across the globe. To step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find things - businesses that customers love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns, and are durable that can last for decades. We think Prime is that. We think marketplace is that. We think AWS is that. And we are constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria. So - but as we continue to invest, primarily in. As I said in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we are constantly looking for cost efficiencies and fixing variable productivity. I think a thing to think about is the investments will ebb and flow over time, but our focus on cost reductions and improvement on customer experience will be constant.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense, you know, as we look at the slowing growth in AWS, obviously still from an incredibly high level and still very strong growth there. But take - try and take that into context with the growth in margins that you keep seeing in that business to levels that certainly seem a lot higher than you would anticipate for an Amazon business. Is there any capacity constraint or management that, that's driving pricing strategy in AWS? We've heard the comments about the number of availability zones that are being launched this year, which is obviously about, a big part of driving incremental capacity in that business and just trying to balance those, think about how we should balance those three things?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We have - we just announced Korea as a region and we'll be adding five more regions in the next, in the future, in the near future, as we mentioned. CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures, particularly in AWS. And we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers. CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014 and grew even more to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. From the new regions, they are not the major driver in any way. Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth. But there is certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region. So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015. But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on, yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3. But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business. On a dollar basis, we continue to grow \u2013 we saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and, again, we continue to invent, now with our price, we continue to innovate on behalf of customers and see great customer response.\nHeath Terry: Sure, sure. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kerry Rice with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nKerry Rice: Thanks a lot. First question is if you can provide maybe some context around linearity within Q4, more as a, you know, compares to your expectations, obviously you have a ramp up into the holiday season, but was - did December tail off faster than expected or did the ramp up, did it spike higher than you expected? And then just on the follow-up, maybe can you add some context about how the mobile played a role in the holiday season for Amazon? Thanks.\nPhil Hardin: So in terms of - this is Phil. In terms of expectations, I think we were pleased with what we saw this Q4 and, you know, if you look at what we gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue. So no real callouts there. I think, what was your second part of your question? Oh, and mobile, we said for a long time continues to be a tailwind for the business. We're working very hard to make sure that it's very easy for customers to buy the things they want to buy and access, a lot of the features they\u2019ve grown accustomed to on the website. And so we're very focused on the convenience factor. And if you look at some of our new offerings like Prime Now that's available through a mobile app and very convenient for customers. As Brian's mentioned, allowed them to shop even up to Christmas Eve and then have their items delivered in two hours.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nCarlos Kirjner: Thank you. I have two. I want to go back to AWS margins. You talked briefly about purchasing an asset utilization. But do these explain the 800 bps on a year-on-year margin expansion? And are you seeing anything else? Like, is there any impact of scale driving leverage over fixed costs? Is there some benefit from revenue mix shift, like services like Aurora and Redshift growing faster than EC2 or is all the margin expansion due to purchasing and asset utilization? So that's the first question. And the second, I have a question about your streaming content expenses or cost of revenues to be more precise. Last year you told us they were $1.3 billion, but if you can give us a figure for '15. In lieu of that, can you comment on whether 4Q saw higher than usual costs for streaming content compared to other quarters in the year? Thank you.\nPhil Hardin: Carlos, this is Phil. So your question about the AWS margins, that business as they continued to learn and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to drive costs out of that business. So that's one of the primary drivers of the improvements that you see in margin year-over-year. There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars, but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world. As for the streaming content, we haven't given another update this year and haven't given any commentary on the profile quarter-to-quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Pitz: Thank you. You mentioned Amazon Dash in the press release. Can you give us some color around how you're viewing the traction there both with customers and with brands and devices? And then maybe any update on Twitch. How is traffic and user engagement been trending on that site? Thanks.\nPhil Hardin: This is Phil. So on the Dash Buttons, we're really excited about what we're delivering there. I think, as you saw in the release, there are some new devices that take advantage of the underlying service that we think will be really convenient for sellers and interesting for device makers. So we're excited about what we're building there. Don't have any stats for you today. On the Twitch side, we continue to let Twitch do what Twitch does best. And so don't have any updates on numbers there. But they continue to really engage customers and offer a really unique experience, which was one of the reasons we were attracted to them to start with.\nBrian Pitz: And maybe just quickly, end of year fulfillment and sortation centers?\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. I'll take that. So we ended the year at 123 fulfillment centers, up a net 14, and we have 23 sortation centers in the US, up four year-over-year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions.\nGene Munster: Hey, good afternoon. I want to just quickly revisit the margin pendulum question and some of your comments, as you mentioned that to kind of expect it to ebb and flow. Could you tell us if you expect it to ebb and flow, but moving higher or is ebb and flow just mean that, that it's kind of undetermined in 2016? And then second follow up is the Robotics, any update in terms of number of robots or how you see that expansion going forward? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, my comment on ebb and flow was more about the investment and also including capital expenditures and capital leases, so not around gross margins. And merely I was pointing out that, again, we've laid out all the invested areas where we're seeing heavy investment. We continue - we see continuation of that certainly into 2016 and beyond. There are quarter-to-quarter and even year-to-year fluctuations in some accounts, and some investment areas. But generally we're pretty transparent on where we're investing our dollars. And then against that backdrop, we are always looking for efficiency and the nice thing about growing the top line at such a high clip is we have a lot more areas for opportunity to save money year-over-year and we always look to do that.\nPhil Hardin: And this is Phil. On the Kiva question, the last update we've given is more than 30,000 robots. We continue to be really pleased with the program and like what it does in the warehouse, both from a density of storage, as well as from making the jobs easier for the associates who are picking packages, by bringing the packages actually to the associates. But no new numbers on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post: Thank you. Two questions. Was there any category mix impacts in the quarter on gross margins, that's just a quick one? And then secondly, as you look back at last year, you had some quarters where you really exceeded your guidance on the CSOI line. Maybe looking back or just looking forward, what are the types of things that causes you to come in at the high end versus maybe the low end when you look back or when you look forward? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. First, on guidance, we keep it pretty consistent process on how we look at guidance and how we value or how we estimate the near-term view of the business. I will point out that Q4 is obviously a very large quarter, the largest revenue quarter by far of the year. There's a lot of demand that comes in the last six weeks of the year as well. So very, very little visibility at the time of guidance when we do recall. So reason our best projections on a lot of fronts. We think it's a similar - we know it's a consistent process and there are times when we under run and sometimes we over run it.\nPhil Hardin: On the - this is Phil. On the category mix question, you know, obviously category mix does play a role in the gross margin. I would say, though, that we're much more focused on operating profit dollars and free cash flow dollars, as we've probably talked about before. The gross margins are impacted by first party versus third party mix, as well as AWS mix if you're looking at the total for the company. So we're much more focused on the dollars. And no specific categories we're calling out as a driver for gross margin because, again, we're much more focused on the profit dollars.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Vogel: Great. Thanks. Just wonder if you could give an update on the strategy around same-day shipping. How we should think about kind of further expansion of that and kind of what parameters do you guys use to determine what markets to go in? Is it density of the market? Is it proximity of your distribution facilities? Just some color on that would be great.\nBrian Olsavsky: So we deliver, really quickly, a couple of ways. One is the same-day that you've seen us rollout in number of markets here in the US. There is Prime Now and we're now in more than 25 metropolitan areas for Prime Now. And delivering for free in two hours is difficult and expensive, but customers love it. So we feel like this is the natural evolution of our delivery and we're happy to invest in that service. You know, we like what it does for Prime members. We like the convenience factor. And so we're taking a long-term approach and doing what we normally do, which is really focus on continuing to drive greater and greater efficiency.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So I wanted to ask little more about North American operating margins. Because I think they expanded just under 50 bps this quarter to 4.7%. And that compares to an average of 200 basis points, thereabouts, expansion of the prior three quarters. So I'm just wondering if in 4Q maybe higher FBAs cost or something else in there that led to maybe an expansion not as great as we saw in prior quarters. And then following up on the Prime Now question, just now, I'm wondering how hour-delivery or two-hour delivery has changed customer perception of just delivery overall? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Yes, again, I'll point out that the demand for FBA services was very high, nearly 50% of our third party units, again, were FBA. And the demand for space and services was very large by our seller base, which was great from a lot of standpoints, but did exceed our expectations. But did make our warehouses rather full and did cause us to incur some additional variable costs in the US. And there is also the dynamic that we were fulfilling more of these units ourselves at our warehouses because of the FBA growth and the retail growth.\nPhil Hardin: On the speed of delivery, this is Phil, you know, all I can say is the customers love the service. It's very convenient, and it gives them flexibility and the ability to get products really quickly. I don't know if there is any big trends we are ready to call out at this point, but they seem to really, really like it. So we're encouraged by that. We're excited to invest in it and excited with what we can do for our Prime members.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nNeil Doshi: Great. Two questions, please. And one, it seems like the Echo did perform well. Can you talk more broadly about your Internet of Things ambitions and kind of how Echo plays into that strategy? And then secondly, just wanted to know a little bit more about restaurant delivery. It seems a little bit outside of the wheelhouse. What's the impetus behind doing more in terms of food delivery and what are your ambitions there? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: So on the Echo, we like what - how Echo has done. We're really excited about the ecosystem and some of the skills that are being added to Echo, as well as some of the other devices that are taking advantage of Alexa, which is kind of the brains behind Echo. So we like our device business in general. As you probably saw from the press release, we had a good Q4, where we did almost doubled, or double what we did last year. So very excited about the devices. We like that they pump more energy into Prime and really the whole ecosystem. Not sure on the Internet of Things, but it's very exciting for devices standpoint. And the brains of Echo are in the AWS cloud. And so, Echo gets new capabilities all the time as Alexa gets better and better. On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for our Prime members. This is tied in with the Prime Now offering in a handful of cities at this point. And so we have the delivery people going out and making the deliveries in the neighborhoods. And so this is one more really valuable convenient service we can offer for our Prime customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Blackledge: Great, thanks. Two questions. First one, shipping costs were higher than we expected. I think it was 12.5% of net revenue versus 11% last year. Just any color on the higher shipping costs? And is that percentage of net revenue a new normal as we are in 2016 now and as we look out? And then the second question on Prime Now, in 25 markets globally, how should we think about the total number of markets that - additional markets you can enter with the Prime Now offering in 2016? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. As you say, net shipping margin was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Again, this is all tied in with the increase in FBA growth and the demand from Prime members. We're shipping more units \u2013 more of our units, so this ripples through our ship cost per unit, and again, the calculation of ship costs as margin is a percent of revenue and that is impacted by the denominator effect on the FBA sales, being booked at a net revenue.\nPhil Hardin: Related to your Prime Now question, this is Phil, we're in more than 25 metropolitan locations. It's - if you've been watching, this rollout's really happened in the last year. So it's been a pretty rapid rollout. And we're excited to bring it to more places. We don't have a target for you today, but we are working hard to bring it to more and more places. We're outside the US now in a handful of countries in the UK and Japan, and Italy and working to expand. So it's a program we're really excited about and we're happy to bring it to more customers.\nPhil Hardin: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2015, "date": "2015-10-23 00:07:07", "content": "Executives: Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations Brian T.

LLC\nOperator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 22, 2015 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 72% to $9.8 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $5.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow, less lease principal repayments was $3.1 billion, up from an outflow of $99 million. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and capital acquired under capital leases was $637 million, up from an outflow of $2.3 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.4 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 489 million shares compared with 481 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $25.4 billion, or 30% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 294 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 272 million, up from approximately 244 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide seller units represented 46% of paid units, up from 42% in the comparable prior-year period. Now, I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.8 billion or 66.1% of revenue, compared with 71.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $7.6 billion, or 30.1% of sales, up approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.1 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 12.4%. Tech and content was $2.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue, compared with 10.8%. Marketing was $1.2 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 4.7%. Now, I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 28% to $15 billion, or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Media revenue grew 8% to $3 billion, or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 35% to $11.8 billion. EGM now represents 79% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income was $528 million, a 3.5% operating margin, compared to a loss of $60 million in the prior-year period. North America segment operating income includes $11 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. In the International segment, revenue increased 7% to $8.3 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 24%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $2.3 billion, or increased 6% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 14% to $5.9 billion, or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 71% of International revenues. International segment operating loss was $56 million compared to a loss of $174 million in the prior-year period. International segment operating loss includes $64 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 78% to $2.1 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $521 million, a 25% operating margin, compared to $98 million in the prior-year period. AWS segment operating income includes $78 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $993 million or 3.9% of revenue, up approximately 460 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $25 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $406 million, compared to a loss of $544 million in the prior-year period. Our income tax expense was $161 million. GAAP net income was $79 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to the net loss of $437 million or a loss of $0.95 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $7.5 billion year-over-year to $14.4 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $9 billion, and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 22% to $14.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 79 from 74 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as a global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we've described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effects on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q4 2015, we expect net sales of between $33.5 billion and $36.75 billion, or growth of between 14% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 340 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion compared to $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $620 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $700 million and $1.9 billion compared to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter 2014. We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Our first question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed. Your line is live.\nScott W. Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question, Brian, International retail growth continues to improve, and I was wondering if you can just talk through some of the dynamics there, understanding that consumption tax in Japan comped, you have some newer markets where you have physical infrastructure now in Europe, and then also the dynamics in India and China as contributors. And then secondly, maybe if you could just, given how profitable AWS has become, if you could give a framework for thinking about the long-term profitability of that business. Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Scott. Thanks for your questions. On the International, yes, you're right. First of all, the FX neutral growth of 24% year-over-year was up 200 basis points versus Q2 and up 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Some of that is due to the comping of the JP consumption tax increase in April of last year, which we said last year impacted Q2 and Q3 and not really impacted Q4. So we're seeing the last of that on the comp. And the impact of Prime Day globally we estimated at about 200 basis points, and we saw a pickup in both. I'll remind you that Prime Day was a global event, so we saw that is International as well, and it was a great event for \u2013 a great day for customers, Amazon and sellers alike. But the base International growth is really being driven by Prime adoption, greater selection, greater Prime selection, including FBA. So it's essentially the same playbook at the U.S., the additional Prime features. We launched a Prime Now location in the UK this quarter. Not materially going to impact the entire continent, but it's a good start. So we like the trends in International, and they mirror many of the same things we see in North America. On AWS, I don't remember your question, business model there. Yeah, let me talk about margin. It was up sequentially from Q2, from 21.4% to 25%. We're continuing to see great acceleration in the pace of innovation. We've launched 530 new significant features this year, which is more than last year already. We continue to lower prices. We've lowered prices eight times since a rather large price cut in April of 2014, excuse me, April of 2014. And we like that the customers are really responding. They like the speed and agility that AWS provides them. They like the new features that we launched, many of which are also enable them to lower their cost of infrastructure. Amazon Aurora, one-tenth the price of other high-end commercial databases, a new storage class of Amazon S3, QuickSight, also very effective and cost-effective products for our customers. So like AWS, the model remains early days and we enjoy leading this business and customers responded well and we believe we are adding new services and features at a rate faster than many others. But the growth rates and margins will certainly remain lumpy and bumpy as we go forward. But we're very encouraged by the business, and so are our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is live.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hello? Can you hear me?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. A question hopefully hasn't been asked already is around AWS. Margins were obviously quite strong in the quarter. Can you speak to the sustainability of the margin improvement that we've seen there, and what is your long-term expectations for profit margins for this business? And if you could give us a sense of what CapEx for this segment of the business looked like in the quarter, and the rate of growth there would be helpful. And then secondly, your employee adds were fairly strong in the quarter as well. I wonder if you could call out any particular areas of \u2013 within the business where you're strengthening your hiring efforts. Thanks.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: So this is Phil. I'll take the AWS portion. So I'll echo what Brian said earlier. This is a young and rapidly growing business, and as you've seen looking backwards, certainly growth rates and margins and capital expenditure timing can be bumpy. We're taking a very long-term view on this business. We're excited about the potential there, and really the team's focused on just keeping their heads down and continuing to accelerate the pace of innovation to try to continue to grow the functionality gap we think we offer. So a lot of hard work going on there. But again, we're taking a long-term view on the business and interested in helping customers as much as possible in that space. On the CapEx, again, we're focused on the ability to drive efficiencies across all of Amazon, but we're also certainly investing in growth. And so, on the AWS side, we've got investment going on around the world, certainly additional servers to support the strong growth we have. And some of the expense for things like data centers or new regions can be a little lumpy, and we've mentioned a couple of new regions we're working on throughout the world. So that's going on as well.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Mark, on your head count question, you're right. Headcount was up 49% year-over-year, which is higher than Q2 \u2013 we saw in Q2. This is going to be primarily in our ops area. If you exclude ops-related employees, our head count's growing actually slower than our FX neutral growth rate of 30%. So, what's going on in ops is we've added 14 net fulfillment centers this year, bringing the total to 123 globally. We've added four sort centers in the U.S., bringing U.S. footprint to 23. We're staffing earlier in those locations, we're in good shape for the holidays and ready to go. The other issue is there, the other reason is that we are also doing a lot of conversion of temp workers to full-time workers purposefully. There is a metric employment of full-time hires. So it is a little bit higher due to that program.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I'm tempted to ask about the long-term margins for AWS, but I won't. Could you talk about two areas? One, EGM growth in North America. It's accelerated really strongly. Any color behind what's \u2013 any particular categories that are driving that? And secondly, you've made some public comments in the last eight months about some, on the retail side, about investments internationally, particularly in India. Could you just refresh us on what kind of levels of spend you're interested in targeting in that market, and then maybe as part of that, any comments on China and how well you think you're doing there now. Thanks a lot.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. On EGM growth, I won't call out any particular categories, but it is a direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection, both our retail selection and also our third party, particularly FBA which is also Prime eligible and then just the responsiveness of our customers, especially our Prime customers to the EGM product line. So, we're very encouraged with EGM growth. And on India, I will not \u2013 excuse me \u2013 I won't give specific dollar numbers around investment, but I can give you an update on India. We're really encouraged with what we are seeing, both on the customer side and the seller side. On the customer side \u2013 excuse me, active customer accounts are up 230% year-over-year. We are in the middle of the Diwali season that is going really well. Sales are 4x what they were last year. So customers are responding greatly this year. We continue to invest. We've been adding products at a rate of 40,000 products per day so far this year. And just as big as the number of sellers, the sellers, the number of sellers has grown more than 250% year-over-year, 90% of those sellers are using our logistics and warehouse services. And as a result, we've tripled our fulfillment capacity year-over-year. So we are very encouraged, as I said last quarter in India, and continue to invest there very heavily.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Mark, I think you asked about China as well, this is Phil. So we're continuing to work on some of the items we've been talking about for a couple of quarters now. So the team had some interesting ideas, really focused on making Amazon a trusted conduit for Chinese customers to access, authentic international branded products, and things that customers can't get. I think Amazon Global Store continues to expand the selection there. We added about another 400,000 items to that store this quarter and continue to focus on using our global network of vendors to be able to get those products to customers. We continue to test store on Tmall as well. The team has some other ideas, but that's what we're talking about so far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS Investment Research.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Can you call out in terms of the 3P business what you're seeing in terms of third party sellers maybe needing to make more and more of their goods Prime eligible? What the economics of that might be in terms of creating a tailwind for the business, and how we should think about that evolving over the next couple of years. Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Eric. What I can tell you is the 3P percent of revenue continues to grow, we are now up to 46% of paid units, which is up 400 basis points year-over-year, and 100 basis points sequentially of Q2. We feel that Prime and FBA are \u2013 reinforce each other. They're inextricably linked. FBA as Prime selection and Prime growth attracts more FBA sellers. So, we have seen growth in FBA, it increases our Prime fast track eligible selection which we like and customers like. So, we like what we see on the third party side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you. We did see the acceleration in EGM. Just wondering if some of the local delivery and Prime Now is driving that acceleration. Is that having a big impact on your business? And down the road, do you think the delivery infrastructure will be valuable in maybe delivering third party and other units? Thank you.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil. So it's still pretty early for a lot of the really expedited delivery options. We've been working on our network for about 20 years to be able to enable some of the really fast delivery with things like Prime Now. But at this point, we're in a relatively small list of cities, but it's expanding pretty fast. I think we launched a couple more Prime Now cities just today, so that brings us up to about 17 across the globe. On the next day or same day, here in the U.S., we continue to expand that as well, but we think that those fast options add us to the consideration set of a customer's purchase on some purchases that we might not otherwise be included in. But at this point, we're still working on that and kind of getting it up to speed. So nothing specific to call out on that. On the other part of your question, we continue to work on the network around the world, but I can't respond to any of the rumors and speculation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Peck with SunTrust.\nKunal Madhukar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. This is Kunal for Bob. Quick question on India. Is there any change or any indication that there might be a change in the regulatory framework that would allow you to go direct?\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil. I don't know that we have anything to comment on on that.\nKunal Madhukar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask the most frequent investor question and concern that we get is when will Amazon flip back to its heavier spending and investment ways from 2014 and earlier? So I just wanted to ask, is that a legitimate question do you think or are you now at a point of scale and market share and maturity that you can sustainably manage the heavy investment while still delivering material profit? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, thanks, Doug. Well, I will point out that this quarter showed a lot of innovation, a lot of new products and features and a lot of investment. We've already talked about India but domestically we are, globally, we are investing very heavily in our Prime platform, both in North America and International and that includes video content and original content, Prime Music. Phil just said the Prime Now has been expanded to 14 metro areas. We've had same-day delivery now in 16 metro areas. We've built 14 new fulfillment centers. We've launched multiple devices including e-readers, tablets that are priced under $50, Echo, Dash Button. So there is a lot of investment going on and there will be continued, especially related to Prime. And on the AWS side, as I said, we have 530 new features so far this year. So innovation and investment will continue and can be lumpy. I hate to use that word again, but could be lumpy over time. The other dynamic in our company though is definitely working on cost reductions and efficiency. And I think you see a lot of that in this quarter's P&L and in our capital efficiency, both in the warehouse world and also in infrastructure. So we will continue to work on costs. The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well. So I would say it's not as much of pendulum as maybe it's been portrayed. It's more of a constant. The investment will, it sometimes ebbs and flows, but the cost reductions will be a constant presence and the increase in customer experience and shortening the time to delivery and making the customer experience better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. You guys have had the Kindle Store in Brazil since December of 2012. Just curious about the learnings around that and kind of what benchmarks are you analyzing as you kind of try to determine whether or not to invest further in a larger Brazil store? And then the second one, just curious for comments on International Prime sub growth. It sounds like Prime subs are growing really well. I think a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned how they're growing over 50%. Is that still the case? And if so, what's driving that faster International Prime sub-growth?\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: So, on the Brazil side \u2013 this is Phil \u2013 we've had the Kindle Store in Brazil for a while. I think we look at all of our investments with an eye towards trying to maximize long-term free cash flow at strong returns on invested capital. So that's across the board. That's kind of the criteria we're using, making sure we're building things that customers love that can have attractive financial returns over time, and can persist for a long time. And if they work, can be big. And so, that's the metrics we're using. There's nothing specific to call out to Brazil though.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And this is Brian. We're not going to update our Prime subscription growth beyond what we said last year at the end of last year, which last year in a year when we raised prices early in 2014. The global growth rate was 53% and North America growth rate was 50%. So, by default, the International growth rate was higher. We like the adoption of Prime internationally. It's helped by additional selection that's available for fast track shipment, including FBA. So that flywheel is working. We've also launched video benefits most recently in Japan, but we have them in the U.K. and Germany. We continue to launch other Prime benefits, Amazon Pantry in Japan and Germany this quarter. We launch Prime Now in the U.K. So, it's very similar to the U.S. story, potentially time lagged a bit, but we are seeing the same customer adoption and impact on growth rates.\nOperator: Our next call, caller, it's from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please proceed.\nCarlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have two questions. So you have told us that you have tens of millions of Prime users that you are investing heavily in Prime. Now, at this scale I know with the 50% plus growth rates that you just mentioned, if you roll the clock two or three years, one can see Prime penetration in markets like the U.S. starting to saturate as there are just so many homes in the country. How should we think about the level of investment in Prime once you have reached full penetration? Are there components that are due primarily to customer acquisition, and what's the right way to think about that? And secondly, what are the economic drivers that justify the business case for Prime Now? I don't expect you to give us any numbers, I've learned that in the last few years. But what are the components of the customer lifecycle value calculation or whatever calculation that you make to justify someone dropping a box with a, I don't know, $15 order to a customer? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Thank you, Carlos. First on, classify as Prime demographics. So yes, we still think there's a lot of people in the country who are not Prime members. And we're anxious to have them try it and sign up and join. The other thing that we see is that with our vast offering of selection and faster and faster shipping programs, we have more competitive offering for many things that they buy. So there's a share of wallet element to it as well over time that we are looking to be more useful to customers all the time. On your comment about the economic drivers of Prime Now, what I'll say is customers really value it. It's not our entire selection, it's tens of thousands of items that they may need on a daily basis. We think it's an interesting part of the selection offer for Prime and it's, in many ways, something that we can do that others can't, because it's a natural evolution of our 20-year effort to grow our fulfillment center network and our scale quite frankly makes it possible to even offer this to customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Doshi with Mizuho Securities.\nNeil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Can you talk a little bit more about India and what's kind of the opportunity there that you see, there's a tremendous amount of \u2013 tremendous middle class there. But the distribution can be very challenging. So is that an area where we could see Amazon really building out the last mile? And then there's been some reports of an Amazon potentially trying to close the gap in terms of delivery and deliver sooner. On the grocery side, what's the impetus there? And can we see how the recent markets have been trending on the grocery side that you've launched recently? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'll take the India question. So again, India is a different market and does not have a lot of the same ready fulfillment options that some other countries did. We see that as an opportunity, an opportunity that we can build and we can bring to sellers. And as I believe I already mentioned, we like what we see. We're very encouraged. Customer accounts, active customer accounts are up 230% year-over-year and sellers \u2013 number of sellers is up 250% year-over-year. 90% of those sellers use our logistics and warehouse services, as you mentioned, which has caused us to triple our fulfillment capacity. And we're happy to do so. We like what we see in India. We think we have \u2013 we're attractive both to customers and to sellers and we like our position.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil. So, on the grocery side, for fresh we're in a handful of metropolitan areas here in the U.S. It's been a relatively measured rollout by Amazon standards. We continue to work on the customer experience and making sure we're really delivering a quality experience for shoppers. And we're also working on the economics. And so we continue to work on that, but not much new to add right now.\nOperator: Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Patrick Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense how some of the recent announcements from FedEx and UPS about pricing during the holidays and the structure of some of the third party relationships might impact you? And given the investments that you've made in your own fulfillment infrastructure, how much of a competitive advantage you feel like you've got during the holiday season as other retailers that are more directly exposed to these changes have to deal with it.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No comment on the pricing. I would say that we have 23 sort centers, which allows us to control a lot more of our shipments for longer. But we certainly value our relationships with USPS, FedEx, UPS and other global carriers. So \u2013 and we're looking forward to a great holiday season.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.\nAaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Hi, guys. Just quickly on, if you can talk about some of the more experimental projects you work on. I guess the travel business you're kind of in again for a few months and got out of, also maybe just with restaurants, providing restaurant delivery. How do you view these services? They're not necessarily core to what you do. Obviously, you can provide those services, but how should we think about these types of investments longer term? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So on destinations, we're constantly trying new things and testing and measuring and iterating here at Amazon. We learned a lot, but we've discontinued that. On the restaurant delivery, we've had it for a couple months here in Seattle and recently announced it in Portland. It fits very well with Prime Now. So at this point, it's pretty small, but something we're excited to do for customers. We think it will be helpful for them, and we're happy to take advantage of some of the competencies we've built with Prime Now and with our fulfillment network so far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies & Company.\nBrian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Some questions on video. Any color such as engagement on the recent launch of video products in Japan, including the Fire TV, the Fire TV Stick, and Prime Video? And also, any general updates on your video content strategy or view on standalone streaming separate from Prime. Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I'll take that one. This is Brian. So no specific callouts in Japan. I would say that we are still very bullish on our Prime Instant Video, especially our new original content we've created. We think it's being critically acclaimed and also a big hit with customers. Man in the High Castle is coming out shortly, as is the second season of Transparent which won Emmys this year. So we're really excited about the creative team we've assembled and the products that they've been able to bring to Prime customers. And we still like the customer reaction. Free trial conversion rates are higher when Prime members stream, and they also renew at a higher rate their annual subscriptions. So, again, that's very important to us as well and we're very happy with the results.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equities Research.\nBen Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, guys. So Prime has done remarkably well with folks willing to pay $99 up front. But do you expect to have different offerings for different cohorts? In other words, right now, Prime is sort of a one-size-fits-all model. Could we see different pricing models for different demographics in the future? And then separately, can you also talk about how shipping leverage changes during the holiday season when shoppers tend to order more items per transaction? Thanks.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Sure. So this is Phil. On the Prime pricing, we do have a few different programs for different demographics today with programs like Prime Student or Prime Family, which we're very excited about. Can't speculate as to what we'd do in the future, but Prime is a program that's really important for us, and we're working hard every day to continue to build selection there and to continue to make Prime better. And so hopefully, you see that in the list of things we've launched recently and the continued cadence of making the services we have better. We just added a lot of new music in our Prime Music program. And as Brian mentioned, some of the upcoming programming should be pretty good in the fall. The Man in the High Castle was actually our most-watched pilot, so we're excited about that one as well. So continuing to work on Prime. On the shipping side, I would say it's a difficult equation. Yes, order size can go up, but we ship a lot of toys and bigger items. So it's hard to predict what that looks like. But having the density, having the sort centers has certainly helped our cost structure in that area and having inventory closer to our customers.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks. So Brian, it seems like you guys are rolling out Prime Now as well as product verticals internationally fairly quickly, especially if you measure it versus the pace of rollout for Fresh or your other international older territories. So am I reading too much into this, or have guys put in place different processes to iterate more quickly? And second, I think you've disclosed that as of the end of 2014, a little less than 10% of your fulfillment centers are outfitted with Kiva. So I guess are all of your other fulfillment centers on a go-forward basis going to have Kiva? If not, why not? And given the pickup and presumably the volume throughput there, does this mean you can slow down the pacing of your build-out there? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, sure. On Prime Now, it is our intent to roll out benefits and functionality globally as quickly as possible. I think we're able to do that with Prime Now and get to the UK faster. We're happy with that. It's not necessarily common on AmazonFresh. They're just, they're different businesses. So we're happy with the launch in the UK and the team did a great job to get that launch in a timely manner. On Kiva, we are up to 30,000 bots at the end of Q3, and they're in 13 fulfillment centers. At the end of 2014, we had 15,000 bots, so we've doubled that amount and they were in 10 warehouses. So our intent is to use that more widely and stay tuned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.\nRon Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just real quickly on paid unit growth, accelerated 26% this year. I realize it's easier comps, but anything significantly higher or anything that happened this quarter? I know Prime Day could be it, but wondering if that was the reason. And then on AWS usage, just wondering if you can give an update on usage. I believe last quarter you mentioned usage was growing faster than revenue. I wonder if that's the same case this quarter. Thank you.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: So this is Phil. On the unit side, you did see units move at a rate that's highly correlated with revenue there. Keep in mind, AWS and some of the other rental-type offerings don't generate units, so we don't count those. But we did see, certainly saw some additional units as a result of Prime Day. And on a longer-term bigger basis, the continued growth of Prime, the continued selection expansion, is helping with the unit's growth there. Sorry, was there a second part of your question?\nRon Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC: It was just on AWS unit growth. I think last quarter, you said it was growing faster than revenue. I'm wondering if that's still the case here.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: We continue to see really, yeah, sorry. We continue to see really strong usage growth across the board, and it's coming from customers of all sizes. We also have recently announced that Aurora, which is our new database software, is our fastest-growing service ever. So for a long time, we talked about Redshift, and Aurora has now outpaced that. So we're very excited about what we're seeing there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nYoussef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, with the courts striking down the Safe Harbor provision between the U.S. and the EU, how do you see the changes to European data storage requirement affecting AWS potentially? And on the Kiva, a question asked earlier, can you just maybe help us understand the capital intensity of an FC using Kiva versus one that's not? Thank you.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: So, this is Phil. I'll take the Safe Harbor question with AWS. With our EU-approved AWS data protection agreement and model clauses we have in place, AWS customers can keep running their global operations using AWS and be in compliance with the e-law. I think your second question was about the capital intensity of Kiva.\nYoussef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Yeah, Kiva, yeah right.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Yeah, I'm going to be vague on the scale of it, but their capital intensity is offset by their density and throughput. So it's a bit of an investment that has implications for a lot of elements to your cost structure, but we're very happy with Kiva. We think it's a great, pairing our associates with Kiva robots to do some of the hauling of products within the warehouse has been a great innovation for us. We think it makes the warehouse jobs better and I think it makes our warehouses more productive.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.\nJohn Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, great. Thanks. Two questions. So first, our data suggest that a U.S. Prime sub growth is growing very rapidly at scale. Just wondering where you think the U.S. Prime sub base is right now on the adoption curve. And then the second question is North America and EGM growth accelerating again this quarter. We're assuming growth is being driven in part by categories like apparel and consumables versus perhaps some more mature category like electronics. So the questions are, with a vertical mix changing, how should we think about the impact of margins or some of the newer and faster growing categories, structurally higher margins for Amazon than the more mature categories? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I would say \u2013 can't get into too much detail on the components of EGM profitability. I would say that we're seeing strong growth across all of our EGM categories. And we have great teams that are chasing a lot of different product lines and working with vendors to get more selection on site, both retail and also third party. So still a lot of room there. On the Prime sub growth, we're not updating the statistics. We are very happy with the growth, not only in participation, but also purchases and retention and we had a very successful Prime Day in July that we're really happy. It was a great event for customers and sellers. That's all I have on that.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: All right. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2015, "date": "2015-07-23 22:27:06", "content": "Executives: Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations Brian T.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Hello. And welcome to our Q2 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO who will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Phil. I will begin comments on our second-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance releases. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.61 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. The increase in capital expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital was 17% up from 6%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. Combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 488 million shares compared with 480 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign-exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 22%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 285 million. Excluding customers who only had three orders in the preceding 12 month period worldwide active customers were approximately 265 million up from approximately 237 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide seller units represented 45% of paid units, up from 41% in the comparable prior year period. Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.16 billion or 65.4% of revenue compared with 69.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.95 billion or 29.9% of sales, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.74 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.8%. Tech and content was $2.70 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 10.4%. Marketing was $1.1 billion or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.7%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International, and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate two segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $13.8 billion. Media revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.99 billion or 32% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM now represents 80% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 113% to $703 million a 5.1% operating margin. Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, North America segment operating income increased 111%. In the International segment revenue increased 3% to $7.56 billion. Excluding the $1.37 billion year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM now represents 72% of International revenues. International segment operating loss was $19 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $89 million of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange. In the Amazon Web Services segment revenue increased 81% to $1.82 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to $391 million, a 21.4% operating margin. Excluding the $71 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, AWS segment operating income increased 314%. Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange, CSOI increased 168%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income include stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP Operating income was $464 million compared to a loss of $15 million in the prior year period. Our income tax expense was $266 million. GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $126 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $6.02 billion year-over-year to $14 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $7.47 billion and inventory turns were 8.9 turns down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $12.39 billion and accounts payable days increased to 74 from 71 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't include additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and if foreign-exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q3 2015 we expect net sales of between $23.3 billion and $25.5 billion, or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between $480 million loss and $70 million of income compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $580 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $650 million, compared to a $136 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our first question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is live.\nMark May - Citi Investment Research: Thanks for taking my questions. You clearly had a lot of things working well in the quarter, but maybe just focusing in on AWS, which seems to be quickly emerging as kid of your largest contributor to operating income. Can you maybe provide a little more color on what drove the acceleration and just the overall growth in the business? If you could talk a little bit about the addition of new customers versus average spend per customer and I think in the past you've talked about what unit growth was for AWS? And in the press release you talked about expanding AWS into some new International markets. Can you give us a feel for how much of AWS' business today is domestic and what kind of opportunity you have there to expand AWS outside the U.S.?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Mark. Thanks for your question. We will not be providing the granular customer detail unfortunately but we will say the growth of 81% was up 49% in Q1. You remember that we are lapping a number of large price decreases in Q2 of last year, so it was somewhat expected but a very strong quarter in AWS. We did announce a region in India. The other thing to mention is that we continue to see very strong usage of growth that's outpacing the revenue growth of 81% obviously. And so, we're really excited about it. From a distribution of customers, it is a global business. We have regions spread throughout the world; we have 11 regions at this point and have announced plans to launch a region in India in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed; your line is live.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you for taking the question. There has been some recent press reports talking about investments in India. I wanted to know \u2013 you've talked a little bit about that market in the past \u2013 whether there was any update there in terms of how you think about approaching the market and the level of investments that might be needed to compete in the market? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly Eric. What I can say about India is when we see a positive surprise we double down on it. That's kind of our policy, and India is that kind of surprise. So we're very happy, very encouraged early on with what we've seen in the ramping of the business, the level of invention going on for both customers and sellers. We are over $25 million or excuse me, 25 million names (14:02) which is the largest online store in India. And we continue to improve pricing and fast delivery so were super excited about India. I will not get into specific investment levels right now but we continue to ramp up our investment there.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you. A couple of questions here. We followed this coming for a long time and profits seem to move around quite a bit year-over-year and year against year. And just wondering how you think about that? Is that just the nature of your big bets and that's just going to continue or is there a way to kind of smooth that out? And then secondly, in AWS it does seem like pricing competition has come down and we've been to a lot of your events and it seems like you're emphasizing pricing a little less to your customers. Can you talk at all about the pricing environment in cloud? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure, let me start with that second question. So, as Phil mentioned, we are seeing continued increases in usage, both sequentially and year-over-year. We are also seeing a great efficiency in the business on a cost basis. Innovation is accelerating, not decelerating. We had over 350 significant new features and services and we believe that's what resonates with customers. While pricing is certainly a factor we don't believe it's always the primary factor; in fact what we hear from our customers is that the ability to move faster and more agiley is what they value. I'm sorry the first party your question was?\nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: I was asking about just how the profitability kind of really moves pretty big swings year-over-year? Is that the nature of your just big bets and that can continue or is there a way to kind of smooth that out going forward? How do you think about that?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes sure. Well here's how I think about it. We have two things, at least two things going on. We are continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we are in, but we are also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Marketplace Prime and AWS. If you saw our shareholder letter this year, I think Jeff Bezos put it really well. He said we're going to look for things that are important to customers, customers love them, businesses that can grow to be a large size that can generate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades. So we will continue to invest in the businesses we think fit that profile and we're always looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that profile. So as far as lumpiness, admittedly it is lumpy and we will continue to work on both those tracks going forward.\nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks. I don't know if Tom's listening in. That's a great exit on his part. On International retail you guys had nice acceleration there. Could you give us a little more of the why behind that? Why would International revenue grow, particularly in EGM, accelerate pretty materially. And is that the impact \u2013 it's one thesis \u2013 is that the impact of kind of the buildup of Prime in International markets and also in the U.S. too, but more spend per Prime customers as they go through this evolution that is just kind of layering on? Is that what it is? What is causing that acceleration? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly. We saw good acceleration in both North America and International this quarter. North America was up 200 basis points sequentially and International was up 800 basis points and half of that you remember we've spoken about the impact of the Japanese consumption tax that was instituted last \u2013 April 1 of 2014. It had a measurable impact on our run rate, our growth rate last year particularly Q2. And so we are lapping that, which sequentially makes up half of the 800 basis points sequential gain. But independent of that, yes, you're right; Prime membership continues to grow. Faster outside, data that we gave at the end of the year. It's growing faster outside the U.S. than it is in the U.S. and we are happy with both growth rates quite frankly. So I would say the Prime membership to Prime flywheel, the additional benefits we are adding to Prime, not only in North America but also Internationally, and additional selection both retail and FBA which feeds the Prime flywheel.\nMark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on the North America retail profitability was up nicely. Can you just talk to some of the drivers of that? Is it more top-line and more Prime subs coming on or is it more on the logistics side and what's driving the North America improving profitability? And then on the International profitability, is there any way you can help us understand the profitability of the more mature International markets like U.K. and Germany relative to the U.S. at this point?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So let me start with North America. 5.1% operating margin was up from 3.9% in Q1 and 3% last Q2. You hit a nail on the head. A lot of it is the top-line growth, but it's also a lot of the efficiency we're seeing, particularly on the fulfillment and marketing lines, which for the whole company were flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis. So we are getting very good top-line growth. A lot of that is fueled by Prime adoption and we are dropping a lot of it to the bottom line with many of the efficiency projects. In International we have not split countries out. What I can say is that if you adjust for foreign exchange the operating margin is up slightly both sequentially and year-over-year. What you're seeing there is also obviously colored by our investment our increased investment in India based on the momentum and the success we've been seeing there so far.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two things I wanted to ask, First on Prime Day. Brian, if you could give a little more color there on the early takeaways that you have and then also perhaps more importantly how you think that sets Amazon up for the back-to-school season and then also the holidays later in the year? And then also can you just comment on the head count, which I believe is up 18,000 or so sequentially, which I believe is the biggest number that you've ever added in a quarter. Is there anything in particular that stands out there, or just more fulfillment centers, more geography expansion as well? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me start with that second question first. Yes, head count was up 38% year-over-year. The vast majority of that is in operations where we are adding people for our new FCs and call centers. We continue to look for smart, innovative people who want to build on behalf of customers and \u2013 but this particular quarter is colored a bit by the operations growth. If you look at Prime Day, we're thrilled with the results of Prime Day. It surpassed all of our expectations. Any metric we look at, everything was a huge success. Customers save millions. New Prime members signed up in higher rates than we've ever seen. People bought more devices than on any other day. So, it's a great success. My hats off to operations team and all the people who worked on that because it was Christmas in July quite frankly, a bigger day than Black Friday, as we've said and orders increased 266% year-over-year. I'll also point out that worldwide FBA unit growth approached 300%, so not only was it a great day for Amazon, it was also a great day for our sellers which is great. So while not breaking out the impact of Prime Day specifically, it's incorporated into our guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.\nCarlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. I may be delusional, but if I add your capital leases and CapEx that suggests that AWS capital intensity is at least 80% if not much higher. What gives you confidence that if AWS continues to grow so fast and consuming so much capital two years out you'll be able to fund its growth from the retail business. And secondly, can you help me understand why you are not ruling out Prime Now and Fresh faster? What specifically are the bottlenecks there? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me start with that second one. Prime Now you said, and Amazon Fresh. We are working very quickly on Prime Now. We've now expanded to nine cities, three more in the quarter including our first International city in London. So, we're moving quick, but we'd always like to move quicker obviously. On AWS I think your question was more around the ability to fund AWS? No comment specifically on that. We do realize it's a capital-intensive business and we have modeling that shows it's going to be a very \u2013 it is a very good business for us and that's what we aim for as long-term return on invested capital and free cash flow. So, we're certainly cognizant of the capital part of the calculation, so not much more I can add on that, Carlos.\nCarlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks, guys. I'm wondering if you can touch a little bit more on AWS margins. Is there a level particularly when you've been able to maintain pricing strength the way you have been, where you feel like margins start to become and that the leverage you have there start to become a catalyst for lowering prices? Or is that purely a competitive decision? And as you think about sort of AWS longer-term, is there a framework or structure that you use to think about where margins in that business should be?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Thanks for your question Heath. I will point out that we have continued to lower prices. We've had multiple price cuts this year. We are now up to 49 since launch in 2006, so it is a fundamental part of our business model. So is innovation. As I said, we have over 350 new features and services \u2013 also significant features and services that have launched this year. And as we were just talking with Carlos, the capital investment is very large as well, so we continue to fund it. And we are super excited with the customer reception that we are getting and the feedback we get from large customers so we are thrilled with the business. And price reductions are part of that model. And again, as I said earlier, we're in the long haul. We're in this for the long haul. We are looking for return on invested capital, free cash flow, and happy customers in the space.\nHeath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. I really appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nYoussef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you. I guess, another question on AWS if I may. So, I want to go back to something that you said, Brian. You said that you've seen greater efficiency in the business from a cost standpoint. I was wondering if you can maybe parse that out a little more for us. Were you referring to OpEx or CapEx? And if you're referring to CapEx as well, do you feel you that you have reached escape velocity that should allow CapEx as a percentage of revenues, pricing aside, to now allow you for a constant decline in that metric, CapEx as a percentage of revenue for that that particular business? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: What I can tell you is we have seen great efficiency on the cost side, the cost to generate the capacity for AWS. I will also say that Amazon is one of the primary large customers of AWS so we see it in the consumer side of the business as well, although that's not included in AWS revenue. It's an inter-company relationship. So, we get a double whammy there. We are getting great efficiency from our external AWS business but also from our own use of AWS services.\nYoussef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.\nRon V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up on Heath's question, just on the price reductions. Brian, you said earlier in the year, can you just compare the reductions earlier this year versus the ones across the board and from last year in 2Q 2014? And then a follow up just on the third-party units I think you mentioned third-party units are now 45% or maybe 47% of total units. Is there a natural limit there or it doesn't matter as long as the customer experience through FBA is seamless? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey Ron. So, I'll comment on the units first. We are really following the model of giving our customers as many choices as possible and letting them choose whether they want to buy first-party or third-party and I think we're working really hard to make sellers succeed on the platform. Brian touched on the success that our FDA sellers had with Prime Day, but we see FBA as a tailwind for third-party business in general. When we surveyed those sellers in the past, in 2014 about 71% of sellers saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program. So we are really happy with what that's doing for third-party business. We're working really hard to give customers as many options as possible and allowing them to choose. And we don't really have a specific target there. It all comes down to customer choice. On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving costs out of the business and you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS. We've also lowered prices for customers 49 times since launch and so it can be lumpy, but over the long haul that's the model we follow.\nRon V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Vogel with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you. Just a question on the content side, is there any update on how engaged folks use the video side of Prime and their shopping behavior, number one. And number two, just any update on sort of your plans for growth on the content cost side? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. On the engagement of the Prime customers, excuse me PIV customers, we have seen buying habits that look like normal Prime customers or other Prime customers from the group that comes in through the digital pipelines, but we do also see a higher pickup in retention rates and free trial conversions. So we're very happy with the linkage between our digital offerings in the Prime customer base. On the content side, I will say that one of the factors in the sequential guidance Q2 to Q3 being lower, is two things. What we are talking about is the fulfillment center \u2013 additional fulfillment center costs that we see this time every year as we get ready for Q4 but also additional step-up in content spend, where we spend a lot of our content in Q3. You will see extensions of a lot of the successful shows that we've had so far this year. A new pilot season including Man in the High Castle and Hand of God so stay tuned for that \u2013 or seasons of Man in the High Castle and Hand of God.\nPaul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nEugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good afternoon, and congratulations. I just want to follow up on a previous question. In past calls you talked about an increased focus on productivity. Is that still a focus of yours? And separately, any thoughts in terms of how robotics are impacting \u2013 any updates in terms of number of robots in fulfillment centers? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure thing. Thanks for your questions, Gene. On robotics first, we don't have any new numbers to share with you, but we're super excited with the progress of that business. We had very high expectations for Amazon Robotics and its impact on our warehouse cost structure and we have been very pleasantly surprised by the job being done on that by that team. So that's looking great. Efficiency, yes. As we've talked about in the last few calls we have even more emphasis on variable and fixed productivity. I think that's evident in the Q2 results that you've just seen. To give you a little more color on that, I would say what does that look like? We have defect reduction and process improvements are probably something we've always done and worked on, both to lower our cost but also to improve the customer experience and also the seller and vendor experience. We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people, which we think it's more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate, especially as we insert machine learning into the decisions. As I said earlier we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business on the Amazon site as well. We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our fulfillment centers and the throughput of the fulfillment centers, and just generally getting inventory closer to customers as we add and expand warehouses in the sort centers that we added primarily last year. All have helped our cost structure, so just a little more color on maybe some specifics on the efficiency area.\nEugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies & Company.\nBrian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks. Now halfway through 2015, any update or insights on your fulfillment center build-out plans for the year? If you can't disclose that, can you maybe just give us a general sense of focus and strategy? How should would be thinking about domestic versus International? As well as sortation versus traditional? What's kind of the path to build that over the next 6, 12, 18 months? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So we ended the year last year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and 19 U.S. sort centers. And typically we're looking at what the demand would be for peak as we figure out what we need; so still a little early in the year to comment on that, but in the past we've given an update sometime around Q3 on that. But continuing to build as we have demand. And like Brian said, we like to be close to customers and benefit from having inventory close to customers as well. So like I said, a little early for the update at this point but something we're looking at and something the team's working really hard on.\nBrian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research.\nColin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks and congrats on the great quarter. In the Retail business obviously a lot of variables driving growth there, we're seeing higher Prime membership levels for one, but I wonder how much of that growth you can also break down by some other factors; for example, we're seeing a notable increase in selection across longer tail categories? And then secondly, in the press release, no mention of Fire Phone. I think almost every other product was mentioned. Can we just chalk that one up now to a learning experience and an example of where Amazon is showing some discipline around investments? Or how should we think about that? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So I'll start with the Fire Phone question. We have a policy of not commenting on our roadmap, so can't give you anything there. We obviously do learn from everything we do and value the feedback we get from customers, but nothing to share at this point. In terms of growth, we continue to see selection as a strong driver of growth. Prime is obviously very important as well; we really haven't teased those apart. FBA becomes very important as well and we've talked about some of the tailwinds we see there, and sort of the linkage between marketplace and Prime that FBA provides. So all those things are going on. As you're seeing EGM strength across a lot of the categories there, there was no single category we're really calling out, but continue to see good selection growth and good Prime growth as well.\nColin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys. So, Brian, I know you guys don't like to provide guidance beyond the next quarter but philosophically if we go back a few quarters you've characterized 2015 as a year where you believe that some of the heavier investments made in prior years should start to benefit and pay off. And we're see \u2013 we're clearly seeing that in AWS and in North America retail and it looks like you're still investing heavily on International retail. So if we kind of look out 2016, 2017, is there any high-level philosophical commentary about whether you see next year as another year of these types of trends that you're seeing now? Or are there any bigger investment areas particularly in the retail business that you might be looking to take advantage of?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks for your question. I can't forecast into the future on that but I will reiterate the investments we have going on right now which again, we're looking to invest to strengthen the Prime platform. That includes video content including Amazon Originals, Prime Music, Prime Now. We have robust device business including the launch of a new Paperwhite Fire TV Echo with general availability and numerous other products that we're very excited about. That roadmap, we know that those devices drive customer engagement and sales. We build fulfillment centers so that we can add selection and we can add FBA partners. And we had things like same-day delivery which we talked about. On the AWS side we continue to invest in that infrastructure. We talked about opening, announcing the region in India so there's expansion there as well. Future expansion, services expansion Internationally very similar to the U.S. on a number of the Prime fronts but also the investment in India. And then a few other things you may have seen in our press release today, the launch of Mexico which we are excited about and Amazon business. So lots of \u2013 as I said, lots of investment in front of us. But we operate in two paths. We are definitely working for operational efficiencies in the business that we're in. We're investing wisely in things that we think are big and important. And it's not a static activity. We continue to evaluate those investments, take into account what customer response is and make changes. So I think you can look forward to the continuation of that into the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.\nKerry Rice - Needham & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. You've talked a lot about operational efficiencies. I know you guys have partnered with the post office and deliveries. Can you talk a little bit about how that is potentially benefiting and maybe the longer-term strategy with the post office? And then, you guys haven't necessarily broken this out, but I think you do generate a fair amount of revenue from advertising. I think that's in the other category. Is there anything that you can provide on advertising revenue? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So I'll start with the first part of that question. We definitely are delivering a lot of packages with the post office. I think most notably they did a lot of the Sunday delivery that you saw when we started launching Sunday delivery. So we try lots of things for fulfillment. We're constantly working to provide the best experience to customers and be as efficient as possible. And so we're happy with all the partners we have and continue to work with them to provide the best experience possible. For advertising, I would remind you that certain parts of the advertising roll up into other. Some actually roll up to EGM and media, as well. So it's a business we're really excited about. We're taking a customer centric approach as we build that to make sure we're providing engaging business, engaging adds to customers and making sure we keep the customer front of mind. And it's a business that the team is excited about and working hard on.\nKerry Rice - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse.\nSteve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Thanks. Brian, just to follow-up on the India question earlier. I mean, o my knowledge foreign e-commerce operators such as yourself are not allowed to have first-party retail operations. But given that fulfillment enhance customer service has always been a high focus item for you guys. What steps have you taken in the country to make sure that the consumer experience there is as good if not better for the inventory on which you have no direct control? And secondarily, similar to China, you have a pretty large population base and Internet penetration growing that's probably comparable to what was the case when you add JOYO \u2013 when you acquired JOYO. So can you provide any color on how the general operating environments are the same or different? And do you expect your growth trajectory there to be similar to what you saw in China? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So, your first question was about the infrastructure and how we're managing the customer experience in India. So FBA, Easy Ship and some of those programs are important to us. They're very valuable for sellers to make it easy for the seller to get their goods to the customer. They're great from a customer experience standpoint because we can do what we do best with the logistics. And so there is a lot of investment and a lot of efforts going on that front. I would say that India and China are totally different. And I think as Brian mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the success we've seen there so far. And so very happy with the trajectory we're on there and excited to be investing and have the opportunities we do at that point.\nSteve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.\nJohn R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. It appears that Amazon is growing its share of household budget driven by many factors, Prime growth and strong growth in large verticals like apparel among others. Specifically on apparel, I'm just wondering how you view the breadth of Amazon's apparel offering. Any color on that segment's performance in the second quarter. And how do you view Amazon's apparel opportunity going forward? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Thanks for your question. We have not broken out specifically apparel, but we're super excited about that business. It's growing very well. We like our position in it. We think our website is very tuned to selling online. So we're very happy with that. It is a big business for us, not only in North America but also Internationally. You mentioned a couple other consumables categories. I will say we are very happy in our consumables and hard lines categories, as well. We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime Pantry and Subscribe and Save and others. So, very happy with the EGM business as a whole.\nJohn R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks.\nOperator: And your final question comes from Scott Tilghman with B. Riley.\nScott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks. I wanted to just follow up on a couple things. Three quick questions, first off on International I was wondering if you could compare and contrast relative performance of media and EGM? You're moving in different directions. Second, there have been a couple questions about shipping but most notable is that we had a couple price increases from the majors hit at the beginning of the year and it seems like you're costs are coming down. I was wondering if you could comment on that. And then third, just following up on Brian's question around the FCs. I was wondering how many of the facilities lend themselves to expansion rather than having to put up a new facility? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Let me start with the first question on International media and EGM. I think we are seeing similar trends in both geographies, those segments that EGM growth is very strong media growth has been consistent for the last four quarters. We do like the work being done by media teams. There's a lot of pipeline of invention: things like Prime Instant Video, Prime Music; all feed the Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will. They work great with our devices by the way. They drive other non-media sales. They are very tied together, although certainly the EGM is outpacing the media segment or media businesses right now. On transportation costs, not a lot to add there. Again, the combination of doing our own shipping and using third-party carriers so the rate increases are staged and we see those quite frequently, so nothing to add there. On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think we are looking to always get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have and as we need new facilities we place them closer and closer to customers so that can have its benefits as well, but not much more to add on that one.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations web site at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2015, "date": "2015-04-23 22:55:04", "content": "Executives: Phil Hardin - Director of Investor Relations Tom Szkutak - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President Brian Olsavsky - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Global Consumer Business\nAnalysts: Brian Pitz - Jefferies and Company Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley Colin Sebastian - Robert Baird Mark May - Citi Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets Justin Post - Merrill Lynch Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray Robert Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer Mark Miller - William Blair and Company Ron Josey - JMP Securities\nOperator: Greetings. Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.\nPhil Hardin: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 23rd, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. In addition, the release includes historical financial results of our North America, International, and Amazon Web Services reportable segments for 2014 and 2013. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 47% to $7.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we included a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash into capital and finance leases. Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.68 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 14%, up from 9%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares, compared with 476 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 15% to $22.72 billion or 22%, excluding $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Active customer accounts was approximately 278 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12 month period, worldwide active customers were approximately $260 million, up from approximately $230 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 44% of paid units. Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.40 billion or 67.8% of revenue, compared with 71.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.62 billion or 29.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.67 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $2.52 billion or 11.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $1.05 billion or 4.6% of revenue compared with 4.3%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. Beginning in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services. In addition we have provided historical results for these segments for 2014 and 2013 with our earnings release filing today. Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $13.41 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.97 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.25 billion, representing 76% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 79% to $517 million, a 3.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 77%. In the international segment, revenue decreased 2% to $7.74 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.32 billion or increased 2%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 4% to $5.38 billion or 21%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 69% of international revenues. International segment operating loss was $76 million, compared to a loss of $33 million in the prior year period. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating loss was $78 million. In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 49% to $1.57 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 8% to $265 million, a 16.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS segment operating income decreased 13%. Consolidated segment operating income increased 41% to $706 million or 3.1% of revenue, up approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 45%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $255 million compared to $146 million in the prior year period. Our income tax expense was $71 million. GAAP net loss was $57 million or negative $0.12 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $108 million and $0.23 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $5.12 billion year-over-year to $13.78 billion. Inventory increased 10% to $7.37 billion and inventory turns were 8.8, down from 9.1 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 13% to $11.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 70 from 68 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q2, 2015 we expect net sales of between $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion or growth of between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 750 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and a positive $50 million of income, compared to $15 million loss in second quarter 2014. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $650 million, compared to $404 million in the second quarter of 2014. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.\nPhil Hardin: Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed. Your line is live.\nBrian Pitz: Thank you. Can you share with us any updated metrics for Prime Now, how sticky is it in terms of repeat customers, average order value or other details? And also any update on your fulfillments center plans for the year, if you can disclose specific numbers, maybe you could just qualitatively tell us your focus either domestic versus international or sortation versus traditional FC build out? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Sure. On Prime Now, we don\u2019t have specific metrics we want to share today. But we have expanded to seven cities with more on the way. Customers are really enjoying the one hour and two delivery of tens of thousands of daily essential products. So the response has been great. We will point out that our operations network that was \u2013 has been building for the last 20 years helps make Prime Now a viable proposition for us and scale makes a possible. So really so far customer responses are great.\nBrian Olsavsky: And Brian on FCs, you know, as we've done prior years, it\u2019s early in the year and as we progress through the year we'll give you some updates on how many. But as a reminder we ended the year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and we'll update you as we go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Thanks for the new disclosure guys, really helpful. I guess, just speaking, you know, now a little bit we all understand the investments you are guys are making on international, retail, and maybe with our margins been declining. Can you give us a little color on what's driving up the North America retail segment margin and I guess in the context of that, just talk about the impact that Prime is having on the retail margin for both North America and International? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. So North America operating margin up a 120 basis points year-over-year to 3.9%. Lot of good cost efficiency, but again we're continuing to invest so actively as we build the Prime platform and that we have customers. So you'll see lot of invention definitely to see the Prime platform, which things like Video Content, Prime Music, as we talk about Prime Now devices that will continue to build fulfillment centers for selection and expansion in FBA. So that\u2019s \u2013 its generally what's driving the operating margin in North America.\nTom Szkutak: And just to add on to that, we're \u2013 we gave metrics last quarter about Prime. It\u2019s growing very fast. As Brian said, we're feeding the platform and certainly common thing with category expansion, new FCs, original content, Prime Instant Video devices, Prime Now. The common theme is they are all really intertwined with Prime and inextricably to our consumer business in Prime. So it\u2019s just we're happy to do it. And the last quarter we gave an indication of the growth rates after being added for 10 year. So we're super excited to have the platform and to continue to invest in it.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys talk a little bit more just about the international business and kind of the key initiatives here in terms of getting the growth to reaccelerate some of these levels? And then also perhaps little bit more on your strategy. In China how you are thinking about the cost structure there, relative to previous years and some of the key ways you might be able to rationalize things there? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, let me start with China. So, I think you'll see a lot invention, you're seeing a lot of invention from us in China right now. Amazon is trusted source of authentic [ph] international products and that\u2019s really what we're doubling down on now with a Amazon global store on our own site, which gives Chinese customers access to over 1 million Amazon products globally. And then the team of flagship store for international brands which you've heard about giving thousands of direct imported products access to \u2013 customer\u2019s access to these products and those happen to be stocked and ready to ship from our fulfillment centers in China. So that\u2019s an added benefit. 25% of those are exclusive \u2013 over 25% of those exclusives to Amazon. So we continue to be selective in our investments there, but we're taking the long-term view and we have hopes for the new initiatives along the global \u2013 with the global store and the team of flagship store.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of the growth for total international, just maybe some comments first about the current quarter and then I'll elaborate little bit further. But the growth was down 2% on a dollar basis, up 14% on local currency basis. So we did see a little bit of improvement in terms of growth rate acceleration versus last couple of quarters. And in addition to the things that Brian mentioned earlier about the Prime platform, that\u2019s something that we're doing globally. And so we're certainly \u2013 all those things we're working on globally. So those are things that at least in most geographies we have today. One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1 we talked about in April 1st there was a consumption tax increase in Japan. We had some \u2013we think some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that in Q1 of this year. So it\u2019s a headwind if you think about it for Q1. But we're looking \u2013 we think there is still a big opportunity, as we mentioned last call, big opportunity with Prime. Prime is growing at a faster rate. We think there is still a great opportunity to add unique selection to \u2013 for category expansion. And again, so we're going to continue feed the Prime platform as we talked about, continue to add selection in a lot of categories. We're also very excited about India, if you take a look at our results for \u2013 from an operating profit standpoint, you see that it was approximately negative 76 million on a dollar basis. If you back out exchange that\u2019s approximately breakeven, included in there we certainly have a sizeable step up in investment in India. And we're super excited from what we see there right now. We think its very big opportunity and we're investing appropriately for that big opportunity. So those are some of things that we're working on and we think there \u2013 we still have a lot of opportunity there moving forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the new inter US [ph] disclosure. Can you just help us on accounting question. The AWS data center costs related to the core e-commerce business, are those being allocated to North America and International, are those being fully embedded into the AWS segment? And then a second question goes back to China. I guess any early learnings from the team of [ph] partnership and whether you have any thoughts or potentially a lower capital intensive grow strategy in China?\nTom Szkutak: To answer you first question, yes, they are, the associated infrastructure cost to run our North America and International consumer business those costs, those infrastructure costs are being allocated to those segments. The second question in terms of China, its early, we're liking \u2013 certainly some of things that we're seeing there, but there is not a lot I can add to that at this stage.\nBrian Nowak: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thanks. Maybe just another follow up on the new segment disclosures. Thanks for breaking it out. You know if we assume that the advertising segment is reasonably profitable than the implication is then that the core retail business is very modestly profitable close to breakeven. And just wondering what the thought process and strategy is behind that. If in a sense there is some subsidy to the retail side being used as you build market share in the core business? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Yes, I think the best way to think about it is, we certainly have an advertising part of our North American consume segments. But the way you should think about it is, we are making some great investments for the long-term and that\u2019s really what's reflected in the operating results that you are seeing in terms of \u2013 so it is certainly impacting the operating margins both for North American and International. So it\u2019s the things that we \u2013 both Brian and I talked about that we're doing globally to support Prime platform all of those things that we mentioned, video content, original content, Prime Now, category expansion, investing on behalf of FBA, which also helps Prime devices. Those are all intertwined and certainly part of that. And then some of the things outside of that are more specifically related to International in addition to those are some of geographic stuff that we talked about. So I think you should think about it that way that certainly think its big opportunity and again, one of the reasons I want to give you an update, last quarter on Prime growth and you can see that that\u2019s going very well. And so we're feeding that and that\u2019s what we have been doing and that\u2019s what you see also and certainly results that you are seeing today.\nColin Sebastian: Very helpful. Thanks very much.\nTom Szkutak: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.\nMark May: Thanks for taking my questions. On the international revenue I believe there is probably \u2013 there's a real distinction here between some of your more established countries and some of your more emerging countries. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about for Germany and the UK and Japan and some of the more established markets, what the profit profile of those markets look like and just how much of the international segment results are being \u2013 losses being held back by a handful of the more emerging markets. And then a question on AWS pricing. It seemed like the pricing environment was pretty competitive last year. What are you seeing in the market this year and what are your expectations going forward? Are you expecting a bit more of a stable pricing environment? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Yes, in terms of International, we're not breaking out individual country results. The one thing that could mentioned around from a country perspective was India in terms of which \u2013 it certainly stepped up our investment. And if you look at it year-over-year, so that\u2019s certainly reflected in the numbers that you are seeing. In terms of AWS, we've had 48 price decreases since inception. The team is doing a terrific job in terms of working on behalf of customers to pass on savings as they see it. But in terms of any comment on what to expect going forward there is not really much to add there.\nBrian Olsavsky: Its probably is worth adding that, although prices are factor, the primary factor for customers choosing with AWS is really around their ability to move quickly and to be nimble and agile. And so we're very pleased with the kind of continued adoption and usage growth we've seen and obviously the benefits of AWS around their ability \u2013 customers ability to be nimble as a primary factor there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.\nCarlos Kirjner: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. My first question is about the profitability of the North America segment. You mentioned a few minutes ago that investments in Prime were part of the \u2013 most of the explanation for what is a relatively low 3.9% margin in North America. Which are much lower than the 5% to 6% EBIT margin that [indiscernible] retailer books? Despite a large benefit of booking repeat net. Here's the question. Prime is not new in North America. You probably have tens of millions of Prime users in the US, 30, 40, 50 million. Yet margins are still low. What gives you confidence that the investments that you are making will pay off? Second question on AWS, if you look at expenses like R&D, perhaps even the fixed component of marketing and sales, which presumably one day will be really fixed, are this still growing significantly? In other words, is there room for significant margin expansion at some point in the future when AWS, I don\u2019t know 2 to 5 or 10 times its current size or do you expect the need to scale up at the same rate as revenues? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: In terms of your first question, specifically related to North America, one of the \u2013 our comments we made last quarter that we disclosed was, we disclosed the growth rate globally, as well as the growth rate in the US. And the growth rate in US after 10 years is up 50%, it was 50% year-over-year. And so 2014 versus 2013 in terms of Prime membership and that\u2019s after a price increase on Prime from 79 to 99. And so, it gives you a feel for the work that we put into Prime to make that experience great for customers and the value that we are giving them. So again, given that growth. And so, that\u2019s what \u2013 that\u2019s certainly one of the things that gives us comfort, but when we look at the individual pieces we like what we see, so in other words, some of the investments we're making, I think as we've talked about in the past, I'll give one example would be video content, both original and license content. We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers and what we've seen and to date is was certainly still an investment for us, its certainly impacting our operating results, but we like what we see. We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline if you will for video content. They convert it at a higher rate. We see \u2013 we have a great retention of Prime members, but those who scream actually, we retain those at a higher rate and we bring in new customers through our video pipeline. The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipeline. So in other words, they are buying very good from a physical product standpoint, as well as digital. So they are buying a diverse set of products. So in other words, this video content that we're spending is helping us customers who buy consumable from us, they will buy clothing from us, they will buy shoes from us, they will buy electronics, they will buy media items. So that\u2019s what we're seeing and so again it\u2019s some of these things are very early. We'll have to over time how efficient they are, but each period we go we keep the data that we see we're encouraged. And so that\u2019s just one example. But that\u2019s why we're investing a lot in Prime and we think it\u2019s a great \u2013 the Prime platform if you will, and we think it\u2019s a great opportunity and again as I mentioned earlier all these things we're investing in are very intertwined.\nBrian Olsavsky: And Carlos, I think you had a question about AWS. From our perspective its business that\u2019s still really in day one. A lot of potential innovation in front of us we believe. And so you can see we're putting a lot of CapEx obviously there and including capital leases and we think over time we will be able to generate significant free cash flow with stronger ROICs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. Thanks. I want to go back on North America retail margins and just I want to try to figure out, I know you're not going to go, where they could go, but if we look in the past, I assume that if the base o2014 and in full year 2013 was probably depressed for North American retail margins, North American segment margins and if we look back five or six years, it's probable that that was running at kind of mid to high single digits CSOI margins. Kind of similar to the incremental margins you just reported for that segment 8.7%. So I guess the big question I want to ask is, is there a structural change in the North American retail business over the next \u2013 this year and the next couple years versus what you had call it in 2004 to 2009 when the margins were \u2013 I think were pretty clearly higher and now you're going to be recovering to those levels. That's what I'm trying to get at. Any color would be great? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Yes, the \u2013 thanks for the question Mark. Just in terms of going forward, we're not giving any specific guidance, beyond the current quarter. So I can't predict for you what could happen. But what you mentioned is, and some of the periods you were describing as you mentioned what our business look like, several years ago when we Prime was nascent and we were early \u2013 a bit earlier business. And so we go through different cycles. We're certainly still investing very heavily. That being said, we \u2013 as I mentioned last quarter, we're spending time on making sure that we get productivity. So we're working on both investing heavily in the business, we're working on fixed and variable productivity in other areas, putting a lot more energy into it. That\u2019s what's helping us with the improvement that Prime mentioned in terms of operating margins year-over-year, it\u2019s a number of different aspects, but certainly mix of business and some productivity is certainly impacting that. But again we think there is opportunities to improve margins over time, you'll have to stay tuned on that to see what it looks like. But we certainly as you can see from not only results, but some of the data points that we've given over the last several quarters we are investing heavily in the business, again, because we like what we see and Prime growing so dramatically globally after being in it for long time and we think that that\u2019s a great platform to feed.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Hey, couple of questions on margins. First on AWS a think those are higher than most of us were thinking. Appreciate the disclosure. What is driving your margin versus your pricing decision? How do you think about passenger cost efficiencies or potential margin growth through your customers. And then secondly on international margins you know, clearly below history, below the US, what kind of things need to happen to get those at least to where the US is today much less back to where they were six or seven years ago? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Justin I'll take the AWS portion of the question first. So our model over the long-term really has been to innovate and to use our scale and position to be able to pass savings along to customers. And so we've had 48 price decreases since we launched. As I talked about earlier, that\u2019s one factor customers save a lot of money, but the primary motivator is really around the innovation that AWS enables and the ability for developers to move really quickly.\nBrian Olsavsky: And in terms of international, again as you mentioned Justin, we are investing a lot right now which impacts the margins there again ex-exchange think of it as approximately breakeven for the quarter. And so again, we're continuing to invest. We're investing in all the things that we talked about related to the platform, continue invest in some emerging geographies, most notably certainly India with the step up given the experience we have. And so we are optimistic over time. We have a lot to do there, we think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. And so that\u2019s what we're doing, but we're excited about the opportunity and that\u2019s why you see the results that you're seeing there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the run rate of CapEx and capital lease obligations in the quarter as any sort of indication for full-year and the trajectory of investment in fulfillment and data centers. And then just on the question of a Prime and Prime Video, as we think about the way that media growth is trending now, is there a point where you start to think of allocating Prime, some of those Prime revenues to media to account for the \u2013 as Prime Video usage increases?\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, in terms of the CapEx question, there is certainly two pieces of that, there is the consumer, the North American, International piece, is a number pieces, but certainly two largest pieces which certainly be the CapEx associated with fulfillment and the second would be infrastructure. And again it\u2019s for AWS versus North America, and International. I'll take the North America and International first. We're seeing good growth and year-over-year in terms of overall unit growth, in terms of revenue growth, certainly ex-exchange, as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s early in the year. So we do every year we'll continue to monitor the growth there. We're making plans for the rest of the year and we'll get back to you as we progress throughout the year in terms of what fulfillment capacity will need to support that growth this year. In terms of web services, it\u2019s obviously growing extremely fast. We saw some acceleration of growth from a revenue perspective. Over the last few quarters here, usage is growing faster than that, so we will be deploying more capital as we go there. In terms of the amounts, specific amounts, we're not giving guidance on that today and one of the reasons it is growing so fast that we wan to make sure we put the right amount of capital in place and the teams has done a great job doing all the planning and the execution around that, so that\u2019s what we're doing there. In terms of media, I am not fully sure I understood the question, but as it relates to I think its video, could you repeat the part of that\u2026\nHeath Terry: Right. Was just getting a sense of as video becomes such a \u2013 becomes a bigger part of the Prime value proposition, do you start to allocate some of the annual revenues from Prime more directly into that media segment. Because of the level of usage associated with Prime Video versus the shipping benefits of Prime?\nTom Szkutak: Heath, we do allocate some Prime to account for the video.\nHeath Terry: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster: Good afternoon. Could you talk little bit about the focus on the same day and same hour and specifically about the incremental investments and just some context to how big of those investments are and separately is what the strategic advantages, there is something ultimately obviously to improve the experience. But do you see in any of your data that this opens you up to be more competitive with traditional retailers? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Yes, I'll take that one. We certainly as I said earlier, we see this as a natural extension of our existing infrastructure investments we've \u2013 the 109 fulfillment centers, again very close to customers. It allows us and locks for a same day and next-day deliveries. And to its extreme one hour and two hour deliveries as you've seen with Prime now. So we're not forecasting or giving much more on that, but we definitely see it as a valuable customer\u2019s proposition, customers and braced it. Again, smaller number of azans [ph] ten to thousands of azans are available for one, two hour delivery and generally in the category, essential products that you would need in short time period.\nBrian Olsavsky: And one thing I would add to that as Brian mentioned, earlier as well, we are in seven cities today and there would be more to come. We haven\u2019t said how many, but you should be definitely expecting more to come and we're excited to do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Peck with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.\nRobert Peck: Yes, thank you. I was wondering Tom, could you give us an update on your retail store strategy. Should we expect stores to open up across the US or is that limited to China, New York. And that number two, India has come up a couple of times on the call today. China had several structural challenges based on the market there. I was curious if you could differentiate what you are seeing that's different in India versus the China challenges? Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: Yes, in terms of our consumer business, we love the business that we have today. We love \u2013 we think there is a great opportunity to do that to continue to expand the existing business that we have. In terms of other things we have long standing practice of not talking about what we might or might not do there. In terms of the second part India, and China could you repeat that part, I am sorry?\nRobert Peck: Sure. So you talked about India a couple of times today on the call. Obviously it's big area of investment focus for the company. China has some structural challenges based on how the marketplace is. I was wondering if you could differentiate what you are seeing in India that makes you optimistic there versus some of the challenges you faced in China?\nTom Szkutak: Yes. Thank you for the question. They are very different, you'll see the growth rate in India is very rapid. We talked about last year and its increasing investment. I think the biggest differences there focused on sellers and the connection of sellers. A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers all across India to succeed and grow their online businesses, you'll see from our press release that we've launched a new apps for that. So that helps them manage our inventory better and also respond to customer inquires. So that\u2019s probably the biggest difference that we see between India and China. But and still very, very early on in India.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. So can you talk about how the impact on available third-party SKUs impacts the business, particular in Europe and ultimately what you could do to drive more SKUs through the platform, whether it's lowering third-party rates or is it other factors to try to get more SKUs on their after a third-party?. Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: We spent a tremendous amount of time on our seller business over the years and trying to improve both the experience for sellers, as well as customers. And we've done a lot of interesting things to help sellers and that\u2019s why you see the results that we're seeing today 44% of our units today, as of this quarter, our third party units, that\u2019s up about 400 basis points from last year. Certainly one of the things that we've talked about its most, that\u2019s notable is fulfillment by Amazon. And so the benefit for sellers is they get to take advantage of our multi newer fulfillment network globally, we have a 109 fulfillment centers globally, as well as our customers get to take advantage of that as prime numbers where we offer in those geography. So it\u2019s really a great benefit for sellers, its good for sellers, its good for customers and we believe good for share owners too. So again, we're very excited, number of different things we're working on, but certainly one of the drivers along with all of the things that I mentioned is certainly FBA is very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair and Company\nMark Miller: Hi, good afternoon. Looking at the service sales less the AWS revenues you've got a $4 billion in fees mostly coming from the marketplace off a strong mid-30%. Help us think about the cost that go against those marketplace fees and specifically within fulfillment if you could help us understand how much of the cost is going against 3P are basically FBA fulfillment, perhaps percent of units part of the FC's that are going to 3P?\nTom Szkutak: So Mark, I can't comment on the derive number, but I can say that FBA continues to grow really well, it\u2019s become a bigger and bigger part of our third party mix over the years. I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it was more than 40% of our third party units. Obviously in the fulfillment line there is cost associated with that as well, as our other third party units as well I think like payment processing and other cost that we incur. So I don\u2019t know if there is much more we can say about that.\nMark Miller: If I can insert a second question, given the upside and profitability in the first quarter, the guidance for the second quarter quite a bit lower. What are the factors you see that are negatives or I guess otherwise people can I think you are sandbagging? Thanks.\nTom Szkutak: Let's take a look at the guidance that we gave, again, we gave as we have in previous quarters, we gave the wide range and from a consolidate segment operating standpoint we gave a 100 to 650, the implied margin at the lower end, the higher end is approximately 50 basis points upwards to 2.9%. This quarter in Q1 we were up 60 basis points year-over-year in total at the upper end of that forecast implied would be up 80 basis points, so again, that\u2019s the range and we think its appropriate range for Q2.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to margins a little bit more on AWS. As a look at the seasonality, I'm wondering if there's any seasonality in margins because it looks like margins 2Q and 3Q came in sub 10% versus mid teens in 4Q and 1Q and then sort of looking at it a different way, maybe given the different profitability into 2Q of last year, did that have any impact on the pricing cuts in April?. Thanks very much.\nTom Szkutak: So, let's start with the increase you saw sequentially in margin from Q2 or Q3 to Q4 of 2014, so revenue grew by about 21.5% sequentially and expense grew by around 10% so obviously we were growing faster in top line and expenses. Over the long-term improvements and efficiency and innovation allow us to drive that kind of cost out of the business. I mean there is certainly was an impact with pricing changes and you probably saw some of that in Q2 as well, but over the long-term that\u2019s the model we follow.\nRon Josey: Great. Thank you.\nTom Szkutak: And with that, thank you joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}], "2017": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2016, "date": "2017-02-02 22:03:14", "content": "Executives: Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor relations, Darin Manney. Please, go ahead.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2017 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And just briefly before we move to questions, I'd like to address our Form 10-K that we'll be filing with the SEC. We received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance regarding our 2015 Form 10-K and have subsequently been engaged with the SEC staff regarding our disclosures. We will be revising the disclosures of net, product and service sales in our Form 10-K. As a result, we expect to file our 2016 Form 10-K later than we typically have, but before the SEC's due date of March 1. These changes relate to our entity-wide disclosures and do not impact the financial results that we report for the company or our segments. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is coming from John Blackledge with Cowan. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the question. So, the first quarter GAAP operating income guide essentially implies negative incremental margins kind of at the low, mid and high end of guidance. So, just wondering if you could frame in order, if possible, the investment areas that are driving the negative incremental margins and then just generally how should we think about the margin profile in 2017? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, John. First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out there as well. We are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX-neutral basis. That includes approximately \u2013 excuse me, yes, on top of that is approximately 250 basis points or $730 million of FX negative impact which brings the non-FX adjusted rate down to \u2013 excuse me, range down to 14% to 23%. I will also point out that we have the leap year comp from last year. Last year, the extra day of leap year was worth 150 basis points to us in our Q1 revenue. This year, that reverses. So we have 150-basis point headwind to growth. And that's been factored into our guidance range. But your question was on bottom line. So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year. I talked about, in prior calls, about the fulfillment center step-up. We had 26 warehouses we added last year. 23 of them were in the second half of the year. Digital content, digital video content and marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year. We continue to invest heavily in those two areas. We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to AmazonFresh and of course we are continuing to invest in Alexa and our Echo devices. And finally, I guess, I'd point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel.\nScott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Questions on video. I was wondering if you could just give any quantification in terms of the magnitude of video spend in 2017 as well as the lumpiness from an expensing standpoint quarterly. And then separately as it relates to just the video service, from a positioning standpoint in the market, how do you think about the unique aspects of the product that Amazon has relative to others in the market in terms of the aggregation tools that are being provided now where some of the value is being perceived longer-term? Is it the uniqueness of the content or is it other things? If you could provide a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Well, ultimately, I'll step back and say one of the main things we look out on Prime Video is customer usage patterns and in 2016 we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading. So we're happy with the engagement that customers have. We're also happy with the \u2013 especially on the Studios side, the people we've been able to work with, some of the most talented people in the entertainment industry. And our customers have responded really well to the shows that we've created. We've garnered awards, of course, but mainly that what we're focused on is good content that is attractive to customers. I'll also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last \u2013 or, excuse me, in Q4. And what we see there is again, original content is a fixed cost expense. The more we can amortize it over a large base, the better off we'll be. But more importantly, we have great content that we want to share with people outside of our primary retail countries. And this takes us to over 200 more countries. So we're very happy with the results in video. Yes, the investment did step up in the second half of last year, including marketing. And that will continue in 2017 and likely beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Can you discuss what you're doing to help merchants in China sell and ship directly to consumers in the U.S. and other developed economies and how that business has been evolving over time? Thanks.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, hi, Ben. This is Darin. Yes. We're very pleased with our FBA offering, and that's really helpful to sellers around the world. Certainly, our international sellers have access to more and more customers through that offering and that doesn't exclude sellers in China as well. The offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great, trusted customer engagement. And we have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there as we continue to focus on great offerings through the AmazonGlobal Store, which offers great brands from outside of China to customers. And so there's a mix of things going on in China and we're happy with what we're seeing in both of those.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.\nJustin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Just a follow-up on India and China. I know you are investing a lot. I'd love to hear how much, but you probably won't tell us. But can you tell us why you think the market is worth investment and what really attracts you to the market as you think out longer-term? And then China, can you give us any updates there on how financial performance is doing and if you've changed your strategy and if anything has gotten better there this year? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with India. So, it's still very early. We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what we've created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years. We continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller features. We rolled out Prime last summer if you'll remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there. So we've had success with [technical difficulty] (10:55) we've been in. We don't expect India to be any different. We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. We're bullish on India longer-term and it's early. But we like the initial engagement we're seeing and the response from, again, both customers and sellers.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, and this is Darin. On China, like I said, we're very pleased with our offering in China. Our strategy there has been one of bringing a trusted and authentic product to customers in China, both domestically and from international offers. So we'll continue to focus on the Global Store there. As you may know, we've launched the Prime program that's focused around the availability of international goods in China and that we're pleased with what we're seeing there.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Two primary questions. Can you give us a sense of what the best way to think about the impact that the shift to third-party and within that, the growth in FBA is having on these sequential growth rates? To the extent that there's 150-basis point impact from leap year on a year-over-year basis, is there a way to quantify the impact that that shift to third-party is having on the growth rate for the first quarter for what you've reported in the fourth quarter? And then on the AWS side of the business, with the price cut in November, can you give us some sense of what impact the price cut had on the deceleration in growth compared to the impact that presumably it had in driving incremental volume to the platform?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with that second question first. So more basically, on AWS, very happy with the response from customers. I feel we've got a very broad base of customers from startups to small-medium businesses to large enterprises to the public sector. And we're continuing to see strong growth across all those sectors. The business is now a $14 billion annualized \u2013 running at a $14 billion run rate. You are right that we had seven price cuts in Q4, essentially timed for December 1, so about 1/3 of the impact was seen in Q4. But that's going to be constant in this business. We've been pretty clear that this business is all about creating new functionality for customers, giving price cuts and then working on the operating efficiencies. So, very pleased with Q4 and the pace of the business. The new services and features last year were over 1,000 versus 700 or so the \u2013 excuse me, in 2015. So we continue to innovate on behalf of customers. We're working with some very large customers in each industry. You've seen probably press releases on companies like Capital One, Workday, Salesforce and others. So, again, widespread usage and new customer adoption, which is great. Your second question on FBA, I can't break out the year-over-year difference there. What I will say the impact of FBA on our business is and first that's one of the things that we look at is how well are we attracting new FBA sellers, because again, FBA reinforces Prime, Prime reinforces FBA. It's a good flywheel and we added active sellers in FBA grew 70% year-over-year in 2016. So we're very happy with the continued adoption of FBA and what that does to Prime, eligible selection for Prime members. The other data point I'll give you that affects our cost structure is our Amazon Fulfilled units, which is the combination of retail plus FBA, grew nearly 40% last year and that compares to our paid unit growth of 24% in Q4. I'm giving you a Q4, not a full year number, but they're similar in relative proportion. The fulfillment center expenses and a lot of our shipping costs are tied to the increase in that FBA percentage and that growth of Amazon Fulfilled units. So that is certainly a factor that we consider a positive from a customer standpoint and it's one from a cost standpoint that we certainly continue to work on every day. But that's about \u2013 I think that's the most I can give you on FBA at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nColin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much. Maybe as a quick follow-up on the quarter, we've heard from other e-commerce companies and retailers about a higher degree of promotional activity during Q4. So I wonder if there was any conscious decision on your part to pull back from some of the more aggressive discounting. And then my whether question is whether you can shed any more light on the motivation to build out the air cargo hub in Cincinnati, understanding the need to support the growth of the core retail business, but also if this gives you more of an opportunity to build out direct connections to suppliers, for example, or a longer-term offer excess capacity or logistics as a service. Thank you very much.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, Colin. On your first question, holidays are always a very promotional period. So we don't see \u2013 I can't really comment on the year-over-year differential in promotional activities to us. We are always looking to not be beat on price. We want to offer the best options to customers and we saw a lot of great response from customers this holiday season. I think we would be a very trusted holiday partner particularly as you get closer to the holiday. So, on the promotion side, we don't consider it a huge factor either way. It's pretty much a cost of doing business 12 months a year for us. And, sorry, the second question is on the hub in Cincinnati \u2013 or excuse me, in Kentucky. Yes, that is \u2013 I saw the announcement on that. That is a partnership we have to build out the facility at the Hebron, Kentucky airport. I think it'll create thousands of jobs over time. What it does for us is it gives us a base for future growth. It's all about supplementing our existing capacity both our partners and ourselves and essentially building capacity that can handle this top line growth and also the growth in AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units which as I just mentioned is even higher than our paid unit growth. So same as some of the investments you saw in airplanes last year, our partnerships with companies that do air cargo. This is about supplying our need for our customers and our sellers. We value the partnership with external, the external providers as well and I think we're all dealing with the problem of having lots of incremental volume year-over-year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Just a question on paid unit growth. For the last several quarters here, it's been accelerating on a year-on-year basis and I think this quarter 24%, it was below the 26% that you reported in Q4 of 2015. Just kind of curious what had been driving the acceleration over the past few quarters and what may be changed this quarter? And then in terms of the Q1 revenue guidance, wondering if you could provide a little bit of color in terms of the impact that maybe the recent AWS price adjustments are having on your Q1 guidance. Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start with the second one. So we factored it in, obviously, into the numbers I gave through guidance, the timing of it was again closer to December 1. So there'll be an incremental differential in Q1 on those price cuts, but this is something that we again have quite frequently and I don't think it's a large factor in Q1. The bigger one is more mechanical that leap day comp I would say. And just if you're looking on a non-FX adjusted basis, the foreign exchange exposure, which I mentioned was $730 million or 250 basis points expected in this guidance.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On the unit growth, we're very happy with the 24% unit growth that we saw in Q4 like you mentioned. Our unit growth has been strong and that's primarily attributable to our Prime program and the customers and members that enjoy that program. As Brian mentioned, that 28% is only part of the story. Our Amazon Fulfilled units, the amount going through our fulfillment centers and which essentially includes our first-party retail and our FBA sales and it grew nearly 40% over 2016. So we're very pleased with those results and happy with the fundamentals of the business from that perspective. Customers continue to respond very well to the low prices. The vast selection which is helped by the FBA sellers and the strong convenience that we can offer through FREE Two-Day Shipping and the multitude of other faster shipping options such as Same-Day, Next-Day and in some cases with Prime Now, the 1-Hour Delivery to 2-Hour Delivery. So Prime membership and selection continues to drive growth and you'll see that in our unit growth numbers.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk obviously about border tax. I was hoping that you could give us some of your initial thoughts there and how you might think about some of the key considerations around a potential border tax. And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about fulfillment centers. You mentioned the 26 fulfillment center buildout in 2016. Any color that you can give us in terms of how you're thinking about that for 2017? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On the first one, we have a long-standing practice of not commenting on regulatory or tax matter. So I'm not going to comment on any proposed issues out there. We certainly keep an eye on external issues and weigh in when we think it's going to impact our business. But, your \u2013 sorry. Your second question was on FCs. We will continue to invest in FCs. The comparable I'll give you is that I won't forecast 2017, but the 20% growth in square footage that we saw in 2015 was followed by 30% square footage increase in 2016. That generally went to service that 40% growth in units, in AFN units. It also included some of the additional logistics delivery stations and all, too. So it's not all FC capacity, that's square footage. But I would say that we are going to continue to invest in fulfillment centers as long as our AFN growth rate maintains high, and we certainly want to keep that high and growing.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Two questions, please. First, any comment on customer growth qualitatively, how that's trended, how that trended throughout the year, accelerated, consistent, decelerated? And then, would you be willing to give any commentary on the engagement impact you're seeing from all of these Echo devices that are getting into households? Are you seeing people shop more? Are they engaging more with other parts of Amazon? Just any sort of impact on what people with these Echo devices do that's different than Amazon customers that don't have them. Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the Echo. So I don't think I'm going to answer your exact question there on quantifying the retail sales through Echo devices. It's still very early days on that, so that's not material. But the engagement is just like any other Prime benefit or investment that we have. We do look at engagement and we like the engagement of customers who have Echoes. But let me step back a minute and give some highlights on that, Alexa and Echo together. As we mentioned in our press release, the unit sales of Echoes grew nine times, 9x, year-over-year during the holiday period. So, great customer adoption. We're really glad to see that and that creates a great base of Echo and Alexa fans out there. We've added 4,000 skills to Alexa since I last spoke to you in October and we're working with a lot of major companies as they add abilities, too, for our customer base to use the Alexa or the Echo to reach them. Tens of thousands of developers are building new skills for Alexa. So, the skills addition should continue. And just as importantly, tens of thousands of developers are also using the Alexa Voice Service to help integrate Alexa into their products, which then creates a great network effect. We're doing that ourselves. If you've seen in the quarter, we added Alexa capabilities to our tablets and Fire TV devices, making them better. So it's a great, again, part of the flywheel in that, Echo and Alexa make the devices better and it builds engagement, not only with Echo and Alexa, but also with Amazon.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On the customer count, no absolute number to give this quarter. As you know, back in Q1 we gave an active customer count that exceeded 300 million and I can say it's still growing and we're pleased with the number there. What we do like is the engagement with Prime. We continue to add Prime members and similar to the flywheel that Brian was just mentioning, that the FBA selection helps us with engaging customers and in particular the Prime program. So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is just on the last mile, the logistics build. Can you help us at all on what you're seeing in some of these markets like the UK where you have more of the last mile buildout done on your own? Is there anything you're seeing about Prime behavior? What are the advantages and even the challenges you're facing as you're building out the last mile? And then secondly, on the brick-and-mortar stores, any learnings, and strategically, just talk to the strategic advantage of having a bigger Amazon storefront. Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with your first question. So as you point out, we've had Amazon Logistics deliveries in the UK for more years than some of our other countries and what we see is it gives us control of the shipment for a lot longer. We can, again, shift order cutoff times out and time is valuable to us because, again, we can avoid split shipments, we can avoid other costs of acceleration. And so having control later in the process is very valuable to us especially as we're working across multiple nodes in a network. But I've driven with drivers in Downtown London and it's a very interesting experience. I think it's a great value to our customers. It's interesting to see the route density that we see in the high cities \u2013 or, excuse me, in some cities and the challenges and the upside of that. But I would say essentially, in a nutshell, our logistics deliveries allow us to have better control of the end delivery in markets where we use it. The challenge is always going to be cost and as we get better at this and get economies of scale, we lower those costs over time. So that's essentially my overview of Amazon Logistics. Sorry, your second question was on \u2013 oh, the stores, sorry. Yes, you probably noticed we launched the \u2013 we opened the Amazon Go Store in Seattle in the fourth quarter. We think that is very interesting. It's only one store at this time. But it's using some of the same technologies you would see in self-driving cars; computer vision, sensor, fusion, deep learning. So it's a great accomplishment by that team. It's in beta right now and we like the promise of that. Probably more advanced and further along are the Amazon Bookstores. We have three physical stores; Seattle, San Diego, and Portland right now. We see adding five more this year. So we're still in that phase where we're testing and learning and getting better, even on the bookstore. I would say there's other things that are physical in nature, the pop-up stores and college pickup points that we learn from as well, and think creates a great value particularly at the college pickup points. So not much projection beyond where we are today except for the fact that we will be adding more bookstores. But we test, we innovate, we think the bookstores for instance are a really great way for customers to engage with our devices and see them, touch them, play with them and become fans. So we see a lot of value in that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Two questions. As we think about investment in the first quarter in 2017, any color how to think about domestic versus international. You did give some comments about India, but just any other color or how to think about it? And then on AWS, you announced both new products that reinvent at the low end and at the high end. Any commentary on if that impacted the types of customers who you've been adding on AWS with those new products. Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I can't give an exact split of the investments by geography, but I would say most of the fulfillment expansion was in North America last year. Most of those 26 warehouses we talked about. We see that being more balanced over time and being more global as we move forward. Video content is with the new global program, global Prime Video is becoming more global with the launch in India as well. And, of course, we had Prime Video in some of our existing countries prior to that. So that is going more global and will be more balanced. As we see devices roll out to other countries, same thing. So I would say over time it will become more balanced and probably what you've seen in the short run tended to be more North America focused. But I can't give you a great split of \u2013 I'm not giving you the absolutes anyway, so I can't give you a great split of the two. And I will also say that we are \u2013 not all of our investments are on the consumer side. AWS continues to expand their global footprint. Last year, we added regions in the UK and Canada. We now have 42 availability zones in 16 geographic regions and we will continue to grow that business globally. And India, again, we've mentioned, but that is, obviously, an international investment.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: On the customer split, we serve \u2013 in AWS, we serve millions of active customers along the spectrum of large enterprise companies as well as small startups and the public company \u2013 or public environment as well. The multitude of launches that we had in reinvent was great for all sizes of customers, really, both large and small; both companies starting \u2013 just getting their start with AWS, but also companies that have been engaged with AWS for many years. And so we're really happy about the engagement of reinvent and the participation in that conference as well as the engagement of the new services that we've launched in Q4 and all of 2016, really.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can ask. One, the other North America revenue line in our view has a lot of advertising revenue in it and that line continues to sort of show a lot of momentum, come in better than expected. Can you talk holistically sort of short-term, medium-term, long-term about how you think you're approaching an advertising business across your broad properties, what that might become longer-term and how that might impact the P&L? And then one housekeeping item, anything to call out as an impact from demonetization efforts in India in either Q4 or Q1? Thanks so much.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, sure. I'll take the advertising question. So yes, it's very early in the advertising space. But what our goals there are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted recommendations. We think that is a good strategy rather than invasive things that take away from the shopping experience. I would say Sponsored Products is off to a great start. I find it a very effective way for advertisers to reach interested customers. We also, on video, have not added much in the way of advertising yet. There's some pre-roll as we call it. But for the most part, we like the progression. We are balancing customer experience with advertising at all times and we like the team that's working on it.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: And on other revenue, I just want to call out, there's a number of things going into that particular line. These things include revenue from our co-branded credit card arrangements and certain advertising, particularly display advertising. We have other types of advertising that's spread out throughout the P&L, whether that's a kind of shared marketing investment from our vendors which goes into contra COGS and lowers the cost of sales, or it's related to other seller advertising which is generally within the EGM and media categories. And so I'd say other revenue incorporates a number of things, not just advertising. And on India demonetization, nothing particular to call out today on that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions. It's about Prime Video. You said you were pleased with the hours of engagement. My question is do you think that the hours of video stream need to accelerate from here to get to an adequate return on the invested capital in video? Or are you happy with those returns with the current levels of engagement? And then relatively on Prime Video, could you just talk about your ambitions to potentially extend the video offering beyond on-demand and into possibly a virtual cable bundle? And then finally, just a question of do you need to aggressively partner with distributors, whether they be cable distributors or hardware device companies in order to get better distribution of the Amazon Prime Instant Video app and content to your customers? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, I can't add too much or won't add too much on the last two questions. But I will say on \u2013 you're talking about the levels of engagement now that we're seeing versus what would be the long-term model over time. We're certainly spending ahead of the value of the engagement right now, but it's a good sign that it's building. And an important step was that global Prime program that we launched in the fall \u2013 excuse me, in Q4. As I said, it's very much a fixed expense game, especially with original content. That fixed amount can go up or down, but the ability to amortize it over a large population is what we're looking for. So, we see a double benefit of the global Prime Video program, again both to amortize the investment in original content but also to show that original content to more and more people, because we think it's done really well. We think it's won a lot of awards and we've worked with some \u2013 again some great, talented people. And it's our ability to scale that and to amortize it over a much larger customer base, which will help us in the future.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-10-27 21:05:09", "content": "Executives: Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.

After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metric and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2016, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal segments. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. The International retail segment margin was the lowest we've seen in quite a while. I was hoping you could provide some of the key drivers there in terms of the drag and any color on how to think about the incremental international investment that might be impacting the 4Q guide. Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Doug. Yes, specifically to International, we are seeing expansion to support selection, expansion at fulfillment network increases. We're also investing in digital content and additional Prime benefits, fresh location Prime Now. But by far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make and very excited about it, the initial reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers. So that is essentially the International margin guidance in Q4.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.\nEugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks. I guess when we think about the progression of margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat-lining of overall margin at this point excluding AWS, I guess should we think about this as being a temporary kind of plateau that will at some point resume once you start leveraging the fulfillment build-out? Or is there something structurally or philosophically changing with the way that you operate your business? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Gene. Well we will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. And the things I'm about to mention fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter. First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year. And it continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3 we added 18 fulfillment centers and we've added five more in October. For the year we'll add 26. Most of those are in North America but that compares to 14 last year and I would look, looking back the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter. So it was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes. Because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth which includes what we ship, includes FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we continue to build for high AFN, or Amazon Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year. Last year we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation and delivery centers. So it's pretty much our customer service centers. So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports operation. So those will dissipate as as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial startup costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable cost as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient than more established mature buildings, so there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017. So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service, think (7:54) rapid growth in that business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my question and I have two. The first one, just to go back, Brian, to the fulfillment build. In the past, I think you've talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies, so with these new FCs opening, could you just talk about it? Have you become more efficient so if you get into a lower volume quarter next year, there's less risk of deleverage? Or should we still kind of think about it's going to take time to get to up to peak efficiency? And then the second one, AWS. Amazon is a company that is very good at removing friction in the purchase process. Could you just talk about some of the main hurdles you still have to overcome for large enterprises to really start using AWS more? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. So the fulfillment network as we built it, yes, they'll be more productive next year than they are this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018. So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity add additional cost to Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we build the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling driven by our FBA program. The FBA program is a key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger and then that's a self-reinforcing where Prime then \u2013 the Prime success attract mores sellers. So we're glad to have that problem. We are just working very hard to get capacity in place and in productive use for Q4 and beyond.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi Brian. This is Darin. On the AWS question, yeah, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers in addition to the technologies that make integrations easier that helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS. So we're going to continue to do that, specifically things like the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases from on premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime. And also many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue to choose the AWS Schema Conversion Tool which really switches database engines to get out of old guard proprietary databases and onto AWS. And so we'll continue to react to customer needs and that will include opening up new regions. We've opened up Ohio this past quarter and we've highlighted that we'll have another number of regions coming online in a few months. So yeah, were doing a lot of things to help make it easier for all customers to migrate to AWS.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Hey, Brian. Would you give us any commentary on two categories, in particular groceries and fashion and apparel? And particularly on groceries, I know in the release there's a couple of data points about Fresh rolling out into newer areas like Maryland, great to see that. But could you just talk about that in the investment horizon? Is that moving the needle for you? And how big that, any way to help us quantify how big that already is to the revenue growth that you're seeing, particularly on groceries and any particular comments on fashion and apparel, same line of thinking? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Okay. Sure. Thanks, Mark. I will start with Fresh and groceries in general. So yes, this quarter we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago. We also launched a new pricing plan which is a monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the U.S. and we've expanded, as you know, previously into London. We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time where we're at, continuing to add zip codes and additional neighborhoods and also in these new cities. Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it's a very attractive service to our customers, which is what we're after. Similarly, but not exactly the same is the Prime Now business, which has similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model obviously where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in one to two hours. But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 cities across seven countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding restaurant, Amazon Restaurant Delivery to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. and that's up from two last year. So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers and we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh and we've now expanded quite a bit as you see in this year. And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously the economics in that business are even tougher, but we do feel that our scale makes that possible because of the geographic footprint and how close we already are to customers.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On fashion, yeah, fashion and apparel continue to be a large part of our EGM business and one that we're very excited about. We continue to make it easier for brands and manufacturers to come on board in that category. We continue to work with brands to come on board and we're happy with the traction we're seeing with those brands. And as we get more and more selection, we're really pleased with the customer engagement that we have there, both from the discoverability, the technology that goes behind making it easier to shop for fashion on our site as well as the increased selection by adding the brands.\nOperator: Thank -\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sorry. To answer your question about was that part of investment. Yes, this is certainly part of our investment but the large ramp, if you will, in investment that we're seeing from the back end of last year and also the first half of this year is more related to digital content and the build in our fulfillment network, which I've already discussed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks a lot. In some of these incremental investment areas like warehouses, logistics and also content, I know in some cases you expense up front. In some cases you amortize over time. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of the recent step-up is kind of being expensed. I'm particularly looking at your COGS as a percent of retail revenues which was up year-on-year for the first time in quite a while. How much of that was because of content that was expensed in the period? Just trying to kind of better understand that. And I think also you've been changing around, and this is happening here shortly, FBA pricing including increasing your storage fees but also reducing your handling fees. I guess the question is, are these changes designed to just pass through kind of increasing shipping costs? Or is this more of a net-neutral change where really the goal is to try to free up capacity in some of your facilities? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start with your second question on FBA. So yes, we did make some changes to the pricing formula for this holiday season. They're essentially meant to incent the right behavior among sellers around holiday. And the biggest issue you're trying to get at is having the most valuable products for holiday in the warehouse in the Prime space and not having the warehouse filled with things that may not sell until after the New Year. So we are trying to incentivize that behavior. We're also trying to incentivize getting inventory into the warehouse quicker. So yes, the formulas were, or excuse me, the changing to the pricing formulas were really with that in mind to help the flow and the base utilization in Q4.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, hi Mark. This is Darin. On the capitalization point, I'd say the things we capitalized are the core buildings and leasehold improvements in the buildings. But the things that we're seeing hit the P&L are the fixed and variable expenses that it takes to run the building and I think that's what Brian's pointing out most pointedly in terms of what is impacting the profitability of the second half. So yeah, the capitalization's relatively small in terms of, other than in the building itself.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\nYoussef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Yes. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. With the step-up in investments in content from Prime Video that you mentioned before, would you also be stepping up the international expansion? Maybe you can just remind us how many countries you're in with Prime Video and whether there is a potential chance of maybe stripping Prime Video from Prime to allow it to be extended to other countries. And then I know you're not guiding to 2017. But just looking at the capacity increases that you've had for FCs for 2016, should we expect kind of that as an ongoing expense going forward? Or is the current buildup enough to maybe give you some spare capacity to cool that down for 2017? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. So first on your video comment. We're in four countries right now, the U.S., UK, Germany and Japan. And we have stated that we will be in India soon. So the content that we are creating, especially through Amazon Studios, we are generally holding the worldwide rights to and can use that in other countries as well. And the cost of that then gets amortized to those countries. It becomes part of the International segment results. So yes, and we consider that to be very valuable as opposed to, versus licensing many times by country, the third-party rights to content that we don't create ourselves. Your question on fulfillment expenses, I can't extend the guidance into next year. We will do that obviously at the end of next quarter. But I would say this was an extraordinary step up, as I mentioned, in Q3 that is tied to very rapid growth in not only paid units but Amazon fulfilled units. So really, our forecast for additional capacity additions and the rate of additions will be tied to those growth factors as well. So we'll have to see. We right now are working on getting the capacity in. It was very lumpy this time with 18 warehouses in one quarter and another five in the first three weeks of the next quarter. So ,and obviously we'll be working on the efficiencies of all the warehouses we have, including the ones we just started up this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.\nColin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. A follow-up on the FC question, and I guess more specifically it sounds like you have enough capacity in terms of fulfillment centers for the holidays, but also wondering what your comfort level is in terms of your shipping partners to manage those deliveries. And then secondly, was wondering how you would characterize the pricing environment for AWS, in particular with more deep-pocketed competitors in the space now. Google in fact highlighted this on their conference call today. Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with transportation. So yeah, we looking forward to a great holiday and that includes working with our shipping partners both in the U.S. and globally. We've worked very closely with them to line up capacity, share capacity plans. We certainly have additional delivery capability of our own. But with all of our partners, we work well in advance of the holiday to get our plans in place. And we feel very confident. We're looking forward to a great holiday not only for customers but also for sellers. On your question on AWS, I didn't listen to the Google call, but you'll have to fill me in on that later. The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is, price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we started this business. So we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only did we lower the prices of our products but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. So they can also benefit from that as well. So if you step back and say why do people choose AWS, I'll give you the points I said last quarter. Basically what we hear are the functionality and pace of innovation is greater than our competition. We have added more new significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. You've read about the VMware deal that we signed this quarter. So we continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better can support customers. And finally experience. We've been in this business a long time, longer than anyone else, and we've used that time to make our products and services better. So there was going to be a lot of winners in this space as we said, but we are very happy with our position and the customer reception to our products.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you. I guess when you look at fourth quarter guidance and you back out AWS, it suggests that margins are, on the core business, are going to be pretty down versus last year. Do you view this as a abnormal investment cycle, or just part of the overall kind of ebbs and flows of the business? And then long-term, I know several years ago you talked about maybe high single digit, low double digit margins long term. I wonder if you could refresh us on that, and also just let us know if you think International has structural margin differences than the U.S. in the core retail business. Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes. As far as the continuation of the investment into next year, I cannot give you much color on that today. What I can tell you again is that we've ramped up considerably. We've been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so. We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year particularly tied again to AWS, or excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend. So we will continue to invest in video content. We'll continue to invest in fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes and shipped unit volumes. We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience. Devices, we'll continue to invest in as particularly Alexa and the Echo products. We'll continue to invest in getting faster and faster shipping methods for our consumers. We believe that's working. We're very happy with the results. We're very happy with all the customers we have but particularly the Prime customers that we have. As far as long-term operating margins, I can't forecast that right now. I can't forecast that for our AWS business either. We are again working on two fronts. We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient, as profitable as possible while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line. We've said we want things that customers will love, can grow to be large, will have strong financial returns and durable and can last for decades. So that's still our mission. We have pillars of the business right now with Marketplace, AWS and Prime and we're actively looking for a fourth and fifth pillar.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. I was just wondering, there have obviously been some headlines since the call that you did earlier with the press on the scale of this investment cycle relative to other investment cycles that you've been through. With the 2014 cycle sort of being the most recent, could you quantify a little bit more how you would compare this investment cycle to that most recent one? And to the extent that we are in the midst of this investment cycle, would you say we're in sort of the earlier or later stages? Any sort of clarity around that would be useful. Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes. The word cycle, if I mentioned that, was a omission. It was a mis-speak. The investment that we are seeing is a step-up versus what we have experienced in particularly the first half of this year and the last half, the second half of last year which I mentioned. But we have said investments are going to be lumpy. They are going to be high sometimes and they'll be moderated at other times. We are right now, the second half of this year looks like a big step-up compared to the first half and it is. But again, it's all areas that we will continue to invest in, some of which I just actually went through the laundry list. So I would not characterize it as a cycle. I would characterize it as continued investments. We make investments with the idea that they are going to pay off and they pay off in either directly in the business they're in or in their contribution to the total business many times as a part of the Prime program.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, just two questions. It seems you're increasing your efforts in the auto vertical with the recent launch of Amazon Vehicles. Just wondering if you could discuss some of the dynamics of the auto industry that make it attractive and maybe how it aligns with the Prime value prop. And also wondering if you had any plans to work directly with auto shops just given your ability to service most areas in one to two days. And then just the second question, on grocery would you consider physical locations in an effort to kind of expand and/or accelerate the growth in that vertical? Thank you.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, hi John. This is Darin. On vehicles, Amazon Vehicles is really a car research destination and really builds the automotive community for customers and gets information they need when shopping for vehicles offsite or shopping for parts and accessories onsite. The features include research tools, community engagement where you can talk to other customers, and certainly we'll try to build a one-stop shop for vehicles as an extension to the automotive store which engages customers to add information about their cars in their garage and which makes it actually easier to shop for parts and accessories for your particular vehicle. And so we think there's a lot of opportunity there to add convenience for customers. On the B2B side, certainly we do have a Amazon business offering. Businesses of all shapes and sizes can sign up to be a B2B customer and the selection that we have in our parts and in automotive categories are certainly open to that channel, but I wouldn't speculate on anything we might do in a particular vertical for those business customers.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. And your comment on, or question on grocery and physical stores, I can't comment on any rumors or speculations there might be regarding that. But what I will tell you is we have experimented with physical stores. As you may know, we have three physical bookstores, one Seattle, one in San Diego and one in Portland and two more coming, one in Boston and one in Chicago. And what we're finding is they're great places for customers to browse what ends up being a curated selection of books and they also get to try out our devices, which is very beneficial. So they get to touch and try our eReaders, tablets, Fire TV and Echo. So we like what we see with that connection and we also have pop-up stores that you may see and also college pick-up points. So we will try different delivery methods or pick-up points or ways of getting product to customers, but nothing specific to point out on the grocery side right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Given the low unemployment rates that you're seeing in the U.S., do you expect any unusual impact on wages for seasonal workers this year? And are you seeing overall wage pressure in the fulfillment centers? And then separately, if you could just talk about trend lines you're seeing in paid units versus shipping units. Are they diverging meaningfully versus the past? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, so on wages, nothing to point out for this holiday. Our challenge generally is the volume of head count that we're looking to hire and we work well in advance with agencies to help to get seasonal employees and many of them turn into full-time employees after the holiday. So nothing specific on the wage pressure front. As you probably saw, head count is up 38% year-over-year in Q3 and that is a continuation of a lot of ops roles they're supporting this high demand, the opening of the fulfillment centers we talked about, new Fresh locations, Prime Now. But also a lot of hiring in our tech areas particularly around AWS and also the Echo, Alexa areas.\nBen Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And the second, the second question?\nOperator: Sorry. Go ahead. Okay. And our final question will come from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nNeil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Can you just provide a little more color into the investments that you're making in India? What's driving that growth and what stage is India in today relative to some of the other large international markets that you've launched in the past?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in India but it is certainly very early on still. Most recent highlights would be the launch of the Prime program in India this past quarter. It's now one of the top selling units based on Amazon.in. And so it's very been very well received by customers. It's hard to compare India to any other country. It's very different in its stage and structure. Being a third-party market has caused a lot of invention on our side. We're being creative. The team there in India has been very creative on whenever they find a roadblock or something that has not existed in another country, they create it themselves, whether that's from delivery stations to working with small merchants to, you name it. So we're very happy with both the customer engagement that we're seeing and also the seller engagement which is very important in India and very pleased with the team that runs it over there and the way they work with teams throughout the world.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: And Brian, to step back to Ben's other question on units. Ben, this is Darin. I will, so you know, paid units grew at 28% again this year as it did in the prior quarter. And as Brian pointed out earlier, our AFN unit, our Amazon fulfilled units, which include our first-party units as well as FBA units that go through our warehouses are continuing, are certainly higher than that 28%. And that's a result of the traction we're getting with our FBA sellers.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: So thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-07-28 22:43:37", "content": "Executives: Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon Brian T.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.\nDarin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We'll be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and the responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Darin. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million. Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion or 30%, excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units. Now I'll talk about our segment results. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. International operating loss was $135 million compared with the loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Amazon Web Services' revenue grew 58% to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services' operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin compared with $305 million in the prior year. Our operating income was $1.3 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared with a net income of $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million compared with $406 million in third quarter 2015. We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, I'll hand it back to Darin.\nDarin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: Thank you, Brian. Before we move to questions, I need to remind you that our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to be appropriate assumption. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. [Operation Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please proceed.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. We've noticed some data points out there that suggest that you're kind of accelerating your build-out of fulfillment capacity in North America and obviously also in India. Can you give us a sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to mid-term on your CapEx, depreciation and ultimately CSOI, especially as it relates to your Q3 guidance? And then just kind of a maintenance question, how much is FX impacting your Q3 guidance? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Yeah, let me talk a little bit about guidance and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. But Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike. In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis. So, why are we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. Customers well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight on capacity. This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are \u2013 Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by \u2013 units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth, so we're 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year. So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 \u2013 excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We are also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals coming out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally. And we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows \u2013 TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments certainly that are increasing sequentially. I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend.\nDarin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: And, Mark, to follow up on the other question, our net sales guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And, Brian, where does that bring your video content spend to with the doubling in the second half if we look at it on an annualized basis?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We're not disclosing that at this time.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to Prime Day for a minute. I didn't hear any commentary around new Prime members in particular. Obviously a lot of other metrics that you gave but hoping you could provide a little bit more color around that. And then also, is there anything else that kind of stood out in terms of what you learned around operations and systems ahead of the holiday season? And then just going back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock-based comp in the third quarter? And if we looked at your 2Q numbers, is that kind of a fair assumption for what you're thinking about? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Let me circle back on Prime Day. So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015. It was a record day for Amazon devices. It was a great day for small businesses and sellers who saw great year-over improvement in their sales. And more importantly, it was a great day for customers. Globally they saved over double what they had saved in Prime Day 2015. So we're very pleased with the results of Prime Day, and the impact of Prime Day is factored into this guidance. As far as new customers and new Prime members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day for both existing Prime members and also new customers who were trying us out for the first time.\nDarin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: And on the stock-based compensation, you'll recall beginning in Q1 this year, we began allocating stock-based compensation and other operating expense to our North America, international and AWS segments. So we're including that in our guidance on operating income and have not separately guided to stock-based comp and other income expense this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon. First, love the conference call format here. Get right to it. In terms of questions, the customer count, can you give us a little bit of guidance on that? And then also talk about the theme of automated consumption and separately, the importance of Prime Now and how you can kind of grow those SKUs. Thanks.\nDarin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: Hi, Gene. This is Darin. I'll start with the customer accounts. As we noted again in our Q1 release, our active customer accounts exceeded 300 million. However, today we're not going to update that number.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: To your question on Prime Now, so I will point out Prime Now is now in more than 40 metro areas worldwide. In the past quarter we expanded further internationally to Germany, Spain and France, so it's a global program, again, offering free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items. We also have in the same vein of, I think what you called maybe automated consumption, the same day has expanded. Now we've added 11 metro areas, bringing the total to 27 metro areas that are qualified for same day. So, yeah, we think this is an important part of our Prime offering. We know customers love it. We're very happy with their order patterns from Prime Now, and very happy with it. Of course, we do always talk about \u2013 we always usually get asked about profitability and it is a very hard service to deliver and make money on, but we know customers love it and we're in a great position to do this because of our long-term approach, our drive of greater efficiencies and our proximity to the customer with our vast global FC network.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. I was wondering as it relates to the Q3 guidance, can you give us a bit of a sense of just how we should think about margins in the AWS business, especially as the next eight availability zones roll out? Presumably that kind of increase in capacity likely has an impact on margins, but would appreciate sort of any direction you can share on how to think about that.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. We don't give \u2013 obviously we don't give segment-based guidance. But to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four regions coming out in the next \u2013 in the coming year. The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions, so we don't see a large step-up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself. We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to have added the region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think when we expand geographically, existing customers will run more of their workloads on AWS. Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps. And we also open up to new customers when we add these regions. So not a large impact on Q3 guidance, but certainly an exciting investment for our customer base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.\nCarlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Two questions if I may. As I look at your tech and content expense as a percentage of revenues, we see year-on-year decline for the last two quarters, which is something we hadn't seen since mid-2010, and of course it's reflected in the AWS margins. Can you help us understand what has driven this significant change in relative trajectory in tech and content expenses? And the second question is, why is it that the rate at which you are deploying Prime Now is so much greater or faster than the rate at which you are deploying Fresh? What's different between them and how is it that you are deploying Fresh in new markets but not as fast as Prime Now, and what drives the difference? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. On tech and content, that's going to be a combination of our people cost related to many areas of the website and also the infrastructure cost to run it, at both the Amazon Web Services and also the Amazon site. We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS. We have great people working on not only better efficiency, but also driving cost out of our acquisition prices. So, there's a lot of great work going on there and I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line. Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we're happy with the current trend and you see it in the AWS margins. On Prime Now versus Fresh, they are separate \u2013 sorry. The \u2013 we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as two new sites in London for AmazonFresh, and that was the first international location. But we've been running AmazonFresh for seven years, or excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America and more so we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding zip codes, adding additional customers. So, the move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data points and as \u2013 it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering. Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. The \u2013 it has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this is more about immediacy of one-hour and two-hour delivery of a curated list of important products that people need in a short period of time. So, they have different roles. Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the Echo. Anything you could share at all on some of the most commonly used searches? How are consumers using the Echo as of now most commonly? And then anything on uplift in purchase behavior from Echo households? And the second one on Prime, on AWS margins, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes that have been driving the AWS margin expansion we've seen in the first half of this year? Is it utilization, product mixes? What's been driving the margin expansion? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Well, in Echo, again, we continue to build out the list of devices, launching the Dot and Tab and Fire TV skills this past year. And now we have 1,900 third-party skills for the Alexa, including new skills from Kayak, Lyft, NBC, Honeywell and more. So there's a lot of uses that we're seeing for Echo. A lot ties into our Prime Music offering. It's just a great way to access Prime Music and more and more the Amazon site. We don't have anything to disclose on physical orders from \u2013 through \u2013 excuse me, orders through Echo. On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this is primarily due to efficiencies gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. There is a \u2013 certainly a mix of products and services. I don't have a bridge for you on whether that's helpful or hurtful, but the \u2013 these margins in AWS will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and that's what you're seeing. But we're very happy with the year-over-year improvement.\nOperator: Next question is from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Hey, Brian, could you give us some wise as to the revenue growth acceleration that you're seeing, a little more color about the revenue growth acceleration in North American retail and in international retail? I remember last quarter you called out really starting to see, kind of I don't know, critical mass tipping point, whatever the buzzword is, from Prime and from FBA in international markets. Is that what's continuing, I assume, to kind of drive that re-acceleration? And any geographic country comments behind that? Thanks a lot.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Yeah, I have the same buzzwords for you, Mark. It's really the flywheel of Prime is definitely working. It's simple as that. The low prices, vast selection and convenience continue to resonate with customers. Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable. So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international, we are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits. We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice-versa. FBA is bringing more Prime-eligible selection to Prime and then the growth of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying behavior is a great traction for other FBA sellers. So that is essentially what we're seeing, and we're certainly pleased with the customer response to those offers globally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.\nYoussef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you. Two questions, please. Brian, your operating income has been come in stronger than expectations, but more importantly, stronger than your own guidance, at least in the last couple of quarters. I was just wondering as you look back at where you guided relative to actual, where do you think that delta was most pronounced? Why wouldn't we assume that maybe, at least on the margin, the investment intensity in the business has maybe decelerated a bit? And second, on Prime Video, just was wondering, considering what the main competitor there is doing, i.e., expanding aggressively around the world, you guys have been growing in a more measured manner, is that still the plan or are you guys interested in maybe instead of moving into a few countries, kind of expand globally in one fell swoop? That's it. Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Let me start with the second question first. So on Prime Video, again we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know the customers love it. We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions. So it's clearly working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in the second half of the year versus last year's second half, and we're tripling the Amazon Originals content. That Originals content for TV and movies, that content can be used globally. We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India, and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, but local content and also Amazon Originals. So, stay tuned for that. I don't have any more to announce on that today. On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is, we came in the very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model usually reacts well to high volume as we get a really good leverage on our fixed expenses. So that's part of what we saw, very strong operating efficiencies as we hit essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance. But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of investments going on at any point in time. I think I heard a question there about level of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, mostly ops and digital content. So we continue to invest on behalf of customers. But we also work very hard at efficiencies and scaling the businesses that we have. So we take both roles very seriously around here, investing on the right \u2013 in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers, and also driving efficiencies. And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly continue to expand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Mr. Helfstein, your line is live.\nRay Mcdonough - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Sorry about that. This is Ray McDonough on for Jason Helfstein. Just on the AWS side, we've been hearing a lot of talk and especially a lot of media reports that larger customers tend to use AWS, they might use Google and Microsoft Azure in tandem in sort of a multi-cloud kind of architecture. Just wondering your thoughts on how you see AWS fitting in the overall ecosystem and kind of your place longer term in the ecosystem.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Well, first of all, we believe customers will choose AWS primarily for three factors, the functionality and pace of innovation that we bring to the table, our partner and customer ecosystem and our experience. We've been in this business longer than anyone. Having said that, there are room \u2013 there's plenty of room for multiple vendors in this business. What we focus on is innovating on behalf of customers and expanding the geographic footprint to make our services more widely available. You can see us continue to invest in things like new application services, higher up the stack, additional technologies that will make integrating with AWS seamless for those companies that have a hybrid IT environment and then continuing to add functionality for data analytics, mobile, Internet of things, machine learning offerings, things like that, that will add greater and greater value for AWS customers. And I would say the rapid pace of innovation continues to stretch our lead in that dimension. We have had 422 new significant services and features added in the first half of this year. That's a faster pace than last year when we added 722 services and features. So we feel good about the business position we're in and our position with customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Robert W. Baird.\nColin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks, guys. As another follow up on the margins, I was hoping you could comment on any impact from the investments and build out of enhanced transportation capabilities including the air cargo leases. And then secondly, was hoping you could identify any categories within EGM that are becoming more meaningful drivers of growth or at least are an increasing focus on the retail side? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, sure. First, on EGM, I'll just say the growth is across a lot of different products, none to exactly call out here, and we think that a lot of it is, of course, driven by the growth of Prime itself. EGM in North America grew 32%, which was higher than the revenue growth rate, and also grew 36% internationally. So when people join Prime, they are certainly buying EGM in strong quantity. So that continues to grow with the growth of the Prime program. On transportation, I think your question was about whether that's impacting our short-term results. No. The answer is no. We are certainly expanding our service offerings in the transportation side and we have been for many years, things like sortation centers and delivery methods. The plane deal that we were talking about is essentially planes that we're going to be leasing from other companies, and you'll hear more about that as we go forward, but that is to essentially take on the demand for internal flights as we move product around. It certainly will be well utilized.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Pitz from Jefferies.\nBrian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for the questions. First, on FC build out, is the cost of building centers scaling over time given the use of Kiva, other technologies or general learnings, or are those costs still relatively consistent? And also, we noticed some device sellout in the next four to five weeks, post-Prime Day. Was this a bit of a planned inventory reduction for some of the devices or did volumes take you by surprise here?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I will start with the second question. So I would just say Prime Day had enormous impact on the device business and devices were well featured and also well adopted by customers. So it was the largest device sales day that we've ever had and essentially pretty much across all of our device types, E-readers, tablets, Fire TV and Echo. And I'm sorry. Your first question was around \u2013 the cost of fulfillment centers. Not disclosing that we do continue to change our fulfillment centers. We've changed, again, the automation, the size, the scale many times and we continue to learn and grow there. So no general trends I can point to on cost per fulfillment center to start up because they do vary in size and mission and some have fully outfitted in using Amazon Robotics, others \u2013 some don't for economic reasons. Maybe the volume is not perfect for robot volume. But yeah. But, yes, so I can't give you any real distinct trends there.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thank you. First on the customers, I'm guessing \u2013 I'm wondering why you aren't giving the number, a lot of people use it for their models. And then second thing, when you look at the U.S. Prime penetration versus total U.S. customers, how do you feel about that and do you think there's still a lot of room for Prime growth in the U.S.? Thank you.\nDarin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: Hi, Justin. This is Darin. I'll comment on the customer accounts again. We may consider updating that in the future, but really we encourage you and our investors to look at our free cash flow measures, our revenue and our GAAP operating profit since our customer purchasing behavior can vary.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And on Prime penetration, of course, we haven't released Prime subscription levels. We have talked about growth certainly globally and in North America. What I can tell you there is we still think there's a lot of room in Prime. We've tailored programs to students. We've tailored video programs. We've rolled out monthly plans. We have plans with grocery delivery. So there's a lot of different flavors of Prime and we are aggressively looking for a perfect Prime for everybody. We know that, again, when customers try Prime, they like it. So it's really just about getting them to try Prime and continuing to deliver great Prime benefits and great low prices and selection.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys. I just had two. First as a follow up on the logistics topic. So, in addition to the cargo planes you just mentioned for in-network moving products around, you guys have registered and received a U.S. Maritime license to operate as a freight forwarder and you recently announced this partnership with the UK for drone delivery that you've been working for a couple years. So I guess at a high level, can you just talk about the overall logistics strategy is evolving from trucks and fulfillment centers to incorporate some of these new methods and how that might impact your unit costs going forward? And then the second question's on AWS. So you continue to put up really strong results. And you guys obviously talk to a lot of customers across lots of different verticals. Just a high level, what percent of enterprise workloads do you think have shifted to the public cloud at this stage? Is it low-single digit to mid-single-digit? And any color there on where we are in terms of penetration in the space. Thank you.\nDarin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: So thank you, Ross. This is Darin. Let me take that first question on Prime Air in the UK, we've been working with and developing Prime Air for some time to develop a rapid delivery system that is safe, environmentally sound and it really enhances the services that we provide for millions of customers. And we're extremely happy to partner with the UK government to advance the safe use of drones for small parcel delivery. This is providing us with permission to trial new methods in the space, including beyond line-of-sight operation, sense-and-avoid technologies and flights where one person operates multiple drones. So we definitely appreciate the pragmatic and forward-looking approach on this topic with the UK and we're going to continue to work with regulators and policy makers in many countries, including the U.S. So we're excited about there. As for the ocean-going licenses, we have no comment on that today.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: As far as AWS, essentially penetration question you asked. We think still very early. Again, we like our position, our industry leading position in the cloud space, and we're working on things that would incent more and more customers to accelerate their cloud conversion. The lower prices and services that we offer, and as I said, we'll work on things that will make it easier and easier for customers to work with us with their hybrid data centers or transfer their volume to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one clarification and one big picture topic. On the clarification, appreciate the disclosure on content and how that'll double year-on-year in the second half. For purposes of just making sure we sort of can understand the trajectory, is there any way to frame it within second half of this year versus first half of this year, just so we can sort of try to triangulate on a gross margin basis from the content spend? And the bigger picture topic would be China, hasn't come up yet on the call. Wanted to understand your latest thoughts there on either the competitive landscape relative positioning in China and how you think about investments in China. Thank you.\nDarin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: So, hi, Eric. This is Darin. I'll take the second question on China. So we continue to operate well in China. We see China as a \u2013 and the way we're approaching China as a way to \u2013 a trusted avenue for our Chinese customers to access authentic international brands and we'll focus on those global brands and bringing those to Chinese customers. Offerings like the Amazon Global Store where Chinese customers can access those international brands on the China website and have them shipped directly to their houses is something we're focused on. So, yeah, it's still early days and some of those experiments that we're doing, but we're seeing good traction on those things and we like that.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah and on the content spend, I think the only other data point I can give you is probably a dated one at this point, but we spent $1.3 billion in 2014, that's the last number that we disclosed and we continue to add content. The best I can give you at this point is that it will be double, nearly double what we spent in the second half of 2015.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Victor Anthony from Axiom Capital.\nVictor Anthony - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.: Thanks for putting me on. Maybe I'll just ask a question about India. You called out India was \u2013 you had the most visited e-commerce site as well as the most downloaded mobile app, and you also launched Prime. So maybe you could just talk about the opportunities and the challenges that you see in that market. And second, there was some press reports that you invested about $500 million of incremental capital in Italy. I was wondering what are you seeing in that market that justifies that level of investment.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So India, we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far in India, both with customers and also sellers; that's a (40:18) third-party seller market. You heard that we launched the Prime program this week, which will be a whole new experience for Indian customers. In hundreds of cities we'll now have unlimited free one-day and two-day delivery, and we also mentioned that Prime Video is coming there, both Indian and global content. We're also starting to see exclusive online sales partnerships. Recently, we've had partnerships with Motorola, Samsung, Lenovo on select phones. But more importantly, again, we really like the opportunity in India. We like the initial results that we see from customers and also sellers. We really like our team there. We have a great team of Amazonian's who've been very inventive in India. Every time there's an obstacle or something that's different from the U.S. or another major business they'll invent around it, whether it's a shipping method or a payment method or whatever. So, very creative and the customer response has been really strong. So we are very excited about the Prime program. We think it'll enter into a new chapter in India, and we've seen great success every country in the world that we've launched Prime, and we feel India is going to be no different. So we're looking forward to seeing what we can do on behalf of the Indian customer.\nDarin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: And hi, Victor, this is Darin. On Italy, yes, we continue to invest in Italy and really throughout Europe to keep pace with the strong customer demand we see. Since opening Italy in 2010, we've invested over \u20ac450 million and created 1,700 jobs in Italy, and this increased investment will be to add future FC near Rome and other infrastructure assets. So, yes, this is really to support both the customers that we have there in Italy and throughout Europe, and we'll continue to invest in the coming years.\nDarin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: So thank you for joining the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-04-29 01:11:15", "content": "Executives: Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations Brian T.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 28, 2016 only and will include forward-looking statement. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial result is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayment increased to $3.5 billion, up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayment and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligation. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investment in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. A combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion or 29% excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had preorders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded $285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units. Now, I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined and titled stock-based compensation and other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference, this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other. In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year. In the International segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion or 33% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss, including stock-based compensation and other, was $121 million, compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million, compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year. In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year. Our operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion or 3.7% of revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. This includes $50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion or 5.7% of revenue, compared to $706 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $475 million. Net income was $513 million or $1.07 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $57 million or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 million in the second quarter of 2015. This includes approximately $825 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense net. We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please state your question.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks a lot. Lots here, but international retail revenue \u2013 the international retail segment really stood out. Revenue accelerated. Seemed like a bit of a milestone also that the CSOI turned positive in a non-Q4 quarter. Can you shed any more light in what the key driver there was and how sustainable it is? And AWS, just mathematically, the comps get tougher starting in Q2, just given what happened in 2014. Is that something that we should be taking into account in terms of thinking about how the rest of the year may progress? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Your first question on international, yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter. International's 26% FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in three and a half years. I would attribute it to the Prime flywheel. As we may have mentioned in the past, we feel that Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% in the U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally. So certainly, a lot going on in international, a lot that's really good, adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So you'll see devices, you see video content. So it's the whole array of Prime offering, Prime Now, Same-Day. Everything is in Europe. It may be getting there a little slower than the starting point in the U.S. but we see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases. On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside, so I would encourage you to look at recent trends. We don't forecast obviously by segment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask you about unit growth overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you've accelerated it now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day. But I just was hoping you could comment on the overall acceleration we've seen here and key drivers behind that? And if there's something different perhaps than what you talked about on international? And then just also on AWS and can you just talk about the underlying drivers here of margins and thinking about that a little bit going forward primary sources of leverage? And as you open up six new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be constant build-out or something that's more lumpy over time and more in waves? Thanks.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil Hardin. I'll take the units question. So really the units are driven by very similar trends to what Brian described. I think when we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously units are a key driver of revenue, things like Prime are key in that bridge. I would also call out selection growth, that's been a big area of focus for us. And one important way we drive selection is through FBA, and so we continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making in FBA. What that means for our Prime customers is there's more for them to choose from, obviously that gives them more they can purchase, it makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell more. And so I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we're seeing here, so selection growth and Prime though are two very key drivers of our growth. On the second part, I think that, Brian...\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, one other comment I didn't say earlier, I do want to point out that because of the leap year there's an extra day in Q1. Every company would have seen this obviously, but we estimated it was worth about 150 basis points to our growth rate revenue. That would be consistent with North America and international. Your other comment was on \u2013 or question was on AWS and a bit about margins and margin outlook. We're very pleased with the quarter, we came in at 23.5% operating margin on a \u2013 the new basis including stock-based compensation and other. We're very pleased. But stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion business, but on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business, they'll be bumpy over time. At any point in time they're going to reflect the balance of investing including global expansion that he's talked about, price reductions we may offer, and also driving cost efficiency, which for us is a very important driver in not only this business but also the North America and international segments.\nOperator: Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. Looking at the active customer account number, it looks like growth slowed pretty significantly, about 10 percentage points. Just curious if you can give us a sense of anything that might be throwing that number off, assuming we're reading it the right way? And then, as you roll out on AWS \u2013 as you roll out the fixed new Availability Zones over the course of this year, is there a way to quantify what kind of an impact that's going to have on the capacity at AWS?\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: So I'll take the first part of your question about active customers. So as we look at our metrics and what information we provide each year, we often make some changes. So this quarter, we only gave the active customers with a paid purchase in the trailing 12 months, and so that number was more than $285 million. I think that's pretty similar to the trends that we've seen in that metric. Now in the past, sometimes we had also given a total active customers count, and so that number for this quarter was over $310 million. So that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth, but the trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both of those numbers. But we opted just to give the other one, but you now have the number for the total number of customers.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And on your AWS footprint question, so we ended the quarter with 33 Availability Zones in 12 geographic regions, and we have five \u2013 11 more Availability Zones opening in the next year. The impact on capital, yes, there will be additional capital investment as we built out those zones. Some of it has already taken place. But I will also say that by and large, the largest increases in capital leases is to support the growth of incremental usage of customers we have now and agreements we have now. So \u2013 and you should expect to see us continue to invest and support this business. We're very, very \u2013 we have a leadership position, we intend to maintain it and we're very excited about where we are.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Two, please. The first one is on Prime. You've two straight years of around 50% Prime subscriber growth. Just curious about how you think about keys to driving Prime sub-growth going forward and the thought process behind the reported monthly Prime subscription? And the second one on logistics investments, so there's been a lot about truck investments and logistics investments. Any comments at all about learnings and what you're seeing from some of the investments in your truck fleet and your own delivery network? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, let me start with the Prime. Yes, we have had very strong growth the last two years and earlier, obviously on Prime growth of members. I would say it's a culmination of a lot of separate investments that we're making. So if you look at the success of our devices, we are seeing tablets where we sold twice the volume in Q1 year-over-year. Fire TV Stick, you may have read in our press release that it has greater than 100,000 customer reviews, the most reviewed product ever, 62,000 or over 62,000 of those reviews are five-star reviews. We've not only had the Echo, but we have the Echo Dot and Tab, so we're branching off that product line and having trouble keeping those in stock. And of course we launched the new Kindle Oasis e-reader. So that is an important part of the story. As it is with digital content, you may have seen the recent announcements that we're working on a great amount of new content for Prime members. We love the \u2013 customers love the content and we like the results we see, particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime. So beyond the awards that the content is winning and the success we're having with Amazon, particularly our Amazon Originals, we feel that program is working. We're going to significantly increase our spend in that area. Some of that is in Q2, you'll see that more in the next few quarters. But we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content to our Prime subscriber base, both through our normal Prime subscription and also the monthly plan that you alluded to.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil Hardin and I'll jump in on the second part of your question. So for the trucks, it \u2013 really it's trailers. The typical use case is running a lag between a fulfillment center and a sort center. So we're running enough volume there that we're using trucks already. We thought it made sense to go ahead and buy some trailers, we're actually still contracting out for the truck part. And it gives us flexibility, we think the economics will make sense over time. Similarly, we've announced an agreement to lease some airplanes with Air Transport Services Group, an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s there, and similar use case, it's products that are already boxed. And we think again, this is activities we've been doing already which need to grow at a very rapid rate. This gives us extra capacity and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers, and we think it makes sense over the long-term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Two questions related to Prime overseas. Could you talk about the status of Prime in international markets? How far rolled out it is in most of your major markets? And then, you talk about Prime flywheels, and you did last year. But it seems likes those flywheels spun faster than you expected in the fourth quarter of last year that caused some near-term expense issues for you? Can you talk about how you're thinking about planning against that as the Prime flywheels are getting broader for you, how do you try to get ahead of that into the peak season later this year? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, sure. Let me \u2013 this is Brian. Let me start with the second question first. It wasn't necessarily the Prime flywheel that was the issue, it was more the FBA demand that we had from FBA sellers for space in our warehouses. We were very full. It was a high-class problem to have. But it \u2013 as I mentioned last quarter, it did result in higher fulfillment costs in the fourth quarter as a result, and I think you'll see some of that dissipated now in Q1, so you could tell it was a Q4 issue. We learn from every Q4, this one was no exception. We are already making plans for a smoother Q4 next year. We will continue to add fulfillment capacity, we will work with FBA sellers on inventory stocking and timing and we think that there's things that we can do better as we do every year, come out of fourth quarter with immense learnings.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil. On the Prime question, we launched Prime in the U.S. in 2005, followed that in 2007 with U.K., Germany, Japan, and then other countries after. We have Prime in all of the countries where we have Marketplaces with the exception of Mexico, China and India. And Prime is really in varying stages in those countries. We have some kind of an expedited shipping offer in all of them. Here in the U.S., we've been talking quite a bit about Prime Now, that's also in Italy and Japan and the U.K. at this point and not others, also varying levels of digital benefits as well. So, generally, the international countries are not as far along with selection or the fullness of the digital offers. We've got Prime Video in the U.K., in Germany and Japan. Music is not fully rolled out yet to all of the others there. So that's where we are with Prime.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please state your question.\nCarlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have two. I think it's the first time since 1Q 2011 that we see tech and content as a percentage of revenue declining or flat. Is this just a sign of your inability to increase investment in line with revenue growth? Or is there something else going on and if yes, what? And secondly, Brian, you said that the growth of Prime has been driven by investments you have made and are making. And you gave the examples of devices that you guys are selling. I think it's a mathematical certainty that Prime subscribers will decelerate in North America at some point from 50% growth. As penetration increases and growth slows, will we see a deceleration in the investment levels? And in other words, how do we think about the effect of deceleration in Prime on the North American margin structure in the future? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Let me start with that second one. So we think there's a lot of room to grow in not only our international countries, but also in the U.S. So we plan on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to video, to two-day shipping, to same-day shipping, to Prime Now. So I don't see that dissipating. And again, it remains the best deal in retail. So hopefully everyone signs up for that. On the tech and content question, I don't have a lot to call out in the quarter. I would say there's no let-up in the pace of invention here, particularly on the AWS side. We usually quote the number of new features and services to you each quarter, we had 214 in Q1, up from 170 the first quarter of last year. So over 26% growth in this quarter alone coming off a year where I believe the number was 722 significant new features and services delivered for AWS customers last year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies. Please state your question.\nBrian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for the question. Any comments on your business in India? How is that market ramping up? And maybe on the competitive front there, any sense of where the local incumbents may actually have some advantage in the region? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, sure. Thanks. Actually, I just returned from India where I spent a week with our teams in Bangalore and Hyderabad. We're breaking ground on a new 10-acre campus there. So we are solidifying and increasing our investment in India on all fronts. I had a chance to see firsthand the level of invention going on with both customers and sellers, making deliveries to customers, seeing the I Have Space program we have with merchants. It's a very exciting time in India and again, the invention is off the charts. We are inventing things in India that do not exist in other parts of the country \u2013 excuse me, parts of the world. And the team there is one of our best. You can see it in some of the external commentary as well. For the second year in a row customers selected Amazon India as Amazon's most trusted online shopping brand. During the quarter, we rolled out a feature called Tatkal which is a studio on wheels that we go to the sellers to help them sign up. We let them do registration, imaging, catalog, uploads and basic seller training. So we're taking it to the sellers, taking the business to the sellers. We've already reached sellers in 25 cities and we're really helping them expand their business not only within their home region, but throughout the whole country.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.\nJustin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thanks. My question is on the international margins. They're quite a bit below where they were many years ago and trailing the U.S. Maybe talk about the dynamics there and what is it going to take to catch up over time? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So, on the op margin side, although there was improvement year-over-year and, yeah, you're right, it is still on FX-neutral basic \u2013 basis negative. We have, as I said earlier, selection expansion, infrastructure investments, fulfillment network and AWS \u2013 excuse me, that's not the international segment \u2013 fulfillment network and digital content. So we continue to build the underpinnings of the Prime program in our international countries. You also have to keep in mind that we're making large investments in India. We're very excited about what we see and we will continue to invest heavily in India.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\nRoss Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. I just had two questions on AWS. First, last fall at re:Invent, you guys disclosed that data management revenue was at a $1 billion run rate. So can you provide an update on that figure? And maybe just talk about how much of AWS revenue today is outside of the storage and compute layers. And then the second question is on the AWS margin. So I think everybody is trying to learn more about the structural long-term margin, and it was down a tad quarter-on-quarter. So is that solely from FX impact? Or was there some seasonality of expenses? Any color on what's driving the AWS margin and how we should think about that over the longer term? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'll take your second question first. So again, we had margin expansion year-over-year that was quite significant, from 12.4% to 23.5%. But again, it's very early in this business. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing on the top and bottom line, but margins are going to be bumpy and affected by levels of investing, price reductions and also cost efficiencies that we're driving. So quarter-to-quarter, it will vary. We are concerned at this point about capital efficiency, returning price to customers periodically with price reductions and adding feature sets for them to make the business more valuable.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil. For your other part of your question, we're not providing an update on the $1 billion stat. What I would say is that the AWS team has strong revenue growth across their suite of products. The fastest-growing product in their history is actually Aurora, the new database. So we're very excited about what we're seeing in that space but we're not breaking out the revenue for those various components today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS Investment Research. Please state your question.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the gross margin, impressive performance in Q1. There were a few headwinds it looked like in gross margin in Q4. Wanted to understand how we should think about the puts and takes in gross margin, it has evolved to be a much higher number over the last couple of years, what some of the puts and takes are going forward especially with respect to content costs? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So I don't have a forecast for you on content costs in isolation or really forward looks on anything besides the guidance I've given you. But, yes, it hits in the gross margin, content costs do show up there. I think the bigger issues that you should look at in gross margin, and again starting with the comment that we expanded by 300 basis points year-over-year, that is really driven by, first of all, the AWS growth and again, $10 billion business growing 64% is very \u2013 we're very pleased with that and that affects gross margin as well. The other bigger element though is the third-party contribution. Third-party units are now up to 48% of paid units and that's up 400 basis points year-over-year, so that continues to be a factor in gross margin. Again, we book that on a net basis. The third-party revenue, it's a positive factor in gross margin and can be a negative factor in fulfillment costs and some of the other metrics.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil. Also just to jump in. The gross margin is not the primary metric we use to measure the business. We are much more focused on free cash flow dollars and operating profit dollars. So there are a whole lot of moving parts in gross margin, and Brian mentioned a lot of them. But it's not a primary metric for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler of Raymond James. Please state your question.\nAaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thanks. Couple of questions. First, if you can just update us on maybe your new advertising initiatives in terms of how the sponsored links are performing? Additionally, if you can just \u2013 maybe just give us an update on Prime Now, it seems like you've rolled out a number of cities for that. How that's evolving and the traction with Prime Now? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So, we're very excited about the advertising business, and we think it's still very early days for this opportunity. So it's an offering we've been working on. We're trying to take a very customer-centric approach. You probably noticed some changes in the treatment on the website. And we did move away from text ads and product ads in favor of some of the other newer products. And we are really excited about the opportunity there is for third-party sellers, and for other vendors on the site. But we are not breaking out numbers today.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: In Prime Now, we are now in 30 metro areas, really from a standing start 16 months ago when we opened our first Prime Now location and it's now a worldwide business in the U.S., U.K., Italy and Japan. So the five cities we added in the first quarter were Raleigh, North Carolina, Cincinnati, Tampa, Liverpool, England, and Osaka, Japan. So, yeah, how do we feel about that business? Again, it offers tens of thousands of daily essential products. We think it's a service that customers like, certainly is hard for companies to do. We think the natural evolution of our operations network and our scale gives us a chance to do this and we are happy to invest in it as a service for our customers. We are taking a long-term approach on this one, though.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Please state your question.\nSteve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Hi. Thanks. So your capital lease-driven property and equipment acquisitions is down again year-over-year. So, will you help tie this to perhaps the overall usage growth at AWS? Or maybe the changing nature of how your enterprise customers may be using the platform to be more compute versus storage or database-heavy? And I think historically on the e-commerce side, you guys have been price followers as opposed to price leaders. AWS, you have been price leaders for the most part for actively taking down price. So, now, given your leadership position, do you think you'll continue to be price leaders? Or do you think it's now time (35:09)?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me start with your CapEx question. So we like to look at both capital expenditures and capital leases because they are both essentially levels with our level of investment. Those totaled $9.5 billion in the trailing 12 months, and it was up 7% from the 12-month period ending this quarter last year. I will point out that the prior year was $6.1 billion. So we have stepped up investment, although it did not go up as much year-over-year this quarter, we are still spending almost $10 billion on what essentially is fulfillment capacity in support of really strong growth, unit growth and FBA, and global expansion and then also on AWS, additional capacity for existing customers as they grow their business and also new regions. We've been working and continue to work very hard on capital productivity. It's very important to us, and I attribute a good piece of the ability to keep that at a modest growth rate year-over-year to our capital efficiency, and better purchasing across all capital and capital leases quite frankly. But again, we are spending almost $10 billion. So...\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: And, Stephen, this is Phil. Just to jump on the usage growth comment, we continue to see really strong usage growth. We are not in the business of raising prices, we lower prices for AWS, so there can be mix for products, but by and large, if you see our revenue growth, know that we are also lowering prices which means that by math, we are typically going to be growing usage at a very strong rate. So I just wanted to jump on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Blackledge of Cowen & Company. Please state your question.\nJohn Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. So the North American EGM segment outperformed our expectations of growth accelerating on a year-over-year basis. Given you don't break out GMV by vertical within the EGM segment and just given the strong growth at massive scale, can you cite any key verticals that were particularly strong? And second question is just an update on Fresh. Rollout has obviously been much slower than Prime Now. How should we think about the Fresh rollout and the impact over the long-term? Thank you.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil. I'll take the EGM question first. So just to put numbers on that, the year-over-year in the U.S. or in North America was 32% growth, which was up from 28% in Q4. And there's not any single categories we're calling out there. To grow on a base that big, that kind of rate, you really need pretty strong performance across the board. So a lot of categories are selling a lot. And it's a lot of the drivers we talked about, as Brian mentioned on the revenue growth side, Prime, selection, growth. And we also benefited from the extra day in the quarter due to the leap year, but strong performance from many of the categories.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. And on AmazonFresh, we continue to have a strong Fresh business in a number of cities in the U.S. We know customers love it. We're making good progress on the economics. And you'll also notice that we have other ways for people to buy consumable products. We have Prime Pantry. We have Prime Now. So we're playing with a lot of different models to see what resonates with consumers and it'll guide our investment decisions going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie Equities Research. Please state your question.\nBenjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: First, congratulations on a great quarter. A couple on Prime and one on China. First, a point of clarification. You answered a previous question by saying that you will significantly increase investment in Prime. Was that in reference specifically to video or should we expect new types of offerings beyond video and music? And then, secondly on Prime, membership is likely hitting some saturation levels for certain demographics in the U.S.? Do you intend to focus on more lower income households for growth there? And then finally, quickly on China, anything notable to call out there that's been different over the recent past driving results, the free trade zone, et cetera?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'll take the first question on content. Yes. My comment on Prime benefits was essentially one about video content and our investment there, not saying other investments may not go up as well, but that is the one that we are focusing on and that I called out. On the comment about Prime, I guess what I'll call availability or...\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Saturation.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: ...saturation, yeah, I think that's one of the thoughts behind our monthly plan. We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low-cost way, if that's how they choose. We've always had our free trial program, but it is a hurdle for many people or there's a hesitancy to put up a full year's payment for a year of Prime. Annual is still going to be a better deal but we know that customers may try it more frequently if it's a monthly plan, and that's what we're looking for. We know that once customers try it, generally, they'll really like it. So we think that will purge (40:38) some other demographic groups as well.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil. Another comment on Prime. On your saturation question, keep in mind that even in the U.S., which is our most mature by years of launch, we still grew last year at 47% year-over-year membership growth, and we continue to make the program better and better. I think the monthly offers are great for flexibility, give people a chance to try new ways. And we continue to add content. We continue to add selection. Prime Now is a huge benefit that didn't even exist two years ago. So all these things are making the program better and we're still out trying to meet as many customers as possible. We're obviously very committed to driving Prime and it's important to the company. Your question on China, probably the biggest thing to point to is more progress and selection on the Amazon global store. So this is our website. This is the offer that allows Chinese customers to shop from the U.S. website, Amazon.com, with prices in RMB and with Chinese-language pages. So it's focused on really items that may be hard to get, and Amazon's really trying to become the trusted source for many of these goods. So really that's a big part of the focus. And if you've been tracking that number over time, we're now up over $10 million, which is good progress on that front.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Please state your question.\nRon Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to North America but this time just focus on margins. 5.5%, 5.4% margins, I think that's the highest level since maybe 2Q 2010 and resumes the margin expansion we saw really for most of last year. So just hoping we can understand \u2013 help us understand a little bit more what's driving that? I'm sure the more mature Prime flywheel you mentioned that's happening in Europe. But is there anything else that's going on besides Prime flywheel, maybe more efficient shipping or things along those lines? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'll start. I think you see the growth rate of the segment at 27%. It's showing the success we're having with customers. When we grow at that clip, we can do a lot of good things it. We can \u2013 on the cost side, we run our facilities more efficiently, we can buy better, we can look to in-source some things that we may have paid externally for. So, there's a number of things that we can do that I think will show up on the bottom line. But principally, what we're trying to do now is \u2013 again, make the Prime experiences as strong as possible for consumers.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil. The other thing I would add to that is that the margin you see in any quarter is really the output of our rate of investment at some places and drive for efficiencies in others. And we're not really trying to optimize for any particular number in a given quarter. We're just trying to make the best decisions we can to grow long-term free cash flow per share. And so, again, we're juggling the investment in the places where we feel like we have long-term opportunities where we need to invest with making sure we're getting continuously better in all our other processes at the same time.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Bob Peck of SunTrust. Please state your question.\nRobert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Thank you. Just two quick ones. Just back to India for a second, I was wondering if you could talk about the regulatory environment there and particularly how it pertains to Amazon Cloudtail. And then number two, on logistics, could you talk about excess capacity in logistics as you build out air, freight, sea, et cetera. And would you ever entertain delivering other companies' items, i.e., like a FedEx or UPS? Thanks.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: This is Phil. I'll take the India question. We're happy to see the recent clarifications and we're happy to operate in any regime. So frankly, the more clarity, the better.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And then on the logistics question, stepping back, the reason we add logistics capability and transportation capability is so we can serve our customers faster and faster delivery speeds and we've needed to add more of our own capacity to supplement our carriers and our partners. They're still, again, great partners, have been and will continue to be for the future, but we see opportunities where we need to add additional capacity and we're filling those voids.\nPhil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.  With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Mahaney: I'd like to focus on the North American retail operating margins. That 4.5% was the highest, I think, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the full quarter of the Whole Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and how sustainable is it?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company on noteworthy North America elements are strongest. So for the quarter, we came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26 -- 36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses were busy. So it's a very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off the similar increase in 2016. So amid all these opening of new buildings, many of them late in the year, the ops team did a fantastic job.  Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offering's more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America, although not in the North America segment. I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say there's the volume -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also very clean operational performance. Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years, and this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: Brian, I was hoping you could talk about how you're thinking about your primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context of '17. There things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also, how you think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. I will be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and the growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're [indiscernible] $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- actually $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response with continued geographic expansion and continuing to again build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits, we continue to expand globally. Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales with very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner, partners we work with, skills that we've increased rapidly, we're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000 plus smarthome devices from 1,200 unique brands. So that -- the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of -- excuse me, Alexa with our devices. Obviously Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets and we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year. Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things that I would point to. And that is an area again where we'll continue to invest heavily, and as you say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is -- fulfillment capacity, especially the fuel strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled the units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate. We expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call. We do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the Video content, their use of it on devices and we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'd be really -- I'd incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: Hey guys, just two questions. AWS reaccelerated again this quarter. Can you just give us some color on what are the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, the shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact often greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods. So we consider that a very strong quarter as down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently. That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. There are now over 100 million items in the U.S. So shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model, and we, at the same time, look then to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area, AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end. So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth -- usage growth continues to be strong growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate, and customers continued to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost error -- excuse me, price decrease last year, but we're very happy with the performance in the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.\nMark May: Brian, if you look back historically, your Q1 operating income guidance is typically about $300 million, $400 million lower than your Q4. Obviously, it's significantly greater than that this quarter. Maybe if you could shed a little light on why that is so and what are some of the key drivers there. And AWS and cloud pricing appears to have been more subtle in the recent quarters. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and why that has been the case at least compared to trends from back in '14, '15, previously.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with guidance. So yes, the operating income guidance is $300 million to $1 billion. Operating income last year was $1 billion. Q1 is generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4 obviously, but a lot of the cost remain from the year-over-year build up in cost, particularly in the fulfillment network. So it's generally a headwind every Q1. It's -- given the 30% plus growth in square footage last year that we've built, that's 1 major headwind from Q4 to Q1. But we also continue to invest, particularly in Alexa and our device area. As I mentioned in a number of comments earlier, we're very happy with the results, the customer adoption, the device sales that we're seeing and the general customer acceptance there. So we will continue to invest there. That's probably the 2 largest factors in Q1, I would say.\nDave Fildes: This is Dave. Just on the second piece on pricing. I think on the pricing environment, nothing really to call out there. I guess, just a reminder on our pricing philosophy for AWS, I mean periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business where reduced prices more than 60x with AWS since launching. So really, our kind of goal philosophy here is to drive efficiencies in our ops and pass those savings on to customers, and some of that's through, again, with the more than 60 price reductions, but also finding through new service and future launches, better options for customer that -- customers to present more efficient features for them to be able to run their businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.\nDaniel Salmon: First, Brian, any comments on the impact of ASC 606 accounting changes on your first quarter guidance here? And then just second on the advertising business, in particular, the ads that we see in the search results on the site, you have line search product sponsored ads, do you aim for certain particular ad load across the entire platform? Do you look at sort of tailoring it based on users activity, maybe a combination of both? I would just be interested in your thoughts on that.\nDave Fildes: Yes, this is Dave. I'll take the first part of that question just around the new revenue recognition standard. We did adopt a new standard in January 1 of this year, 2018, and you'll see that reflected in our financials for the first quarter coming up. There are -- it touches on a number of different parts of our business in terms of how we recognize revenue in terms of any aggregate, the impacts to our expectations for the revenue guidance for the first quarter. It's not material. There's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impacted us. But again, not material in the aggregate.\nBrian Olsavsky: And on advertising, I would say our strategy is to make the customer experience additive by the ad process. We want customers to be able to see new brands and have easier time discovering products that they're looking for. For brands, we think the value proposition is that we can find ways for them, especially emerging brands, to reach new customers. So we're working with advertisers of all types and sizes to help them reach our customer base and the goal of driving brand awareness, discovery and better purchase decisions by the customer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: I think I have two questions. First, your Whole Foods, you've got over a quarter under your belt. How's it going versus your expectations? And what can Amazon really bring now that you've been there for a while, how are you thinking about that? And then secondly, your international decelerated a little bit this quarter, just wondering if there was any country to call out or anything going on there? And we know that you spent about $3 billion on International investment, I guess, last year. Where do you think the high watermark is on that? So just maybe a little more color on your international about business.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the Whole Foods question. We're continuing to be very excited about the opportunities we have to innovate with the Whole Foods and Amazon teams together. In our physical stores, it feels there are supplemental disclosure that physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. So, so far, our focus has been on continuing to lower prices even beyond the initial ones that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and we're -- the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program and we expect to have more on that later in the year. We've also added Lockers, and much more to come. So we're very happy with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin. Also, I will mention that we did see a small operating income loss for the quarter from Whole Foods. At the time of the acquisition, we had stepped up the fair market value of certain assets on the balance sheet. This is going to increase the amortization. It's a noncash charge, but it will increase the amortization over the useful life, and a lot of that is forward frontloaded, so we'll see higher amortization in the first few years, and then it reverse later. So excluding this noncash expense items, Whole Foods had a positive operating income in Q4, but you'll see in the 10-K that the operating income, including the charges, was slightly negative in Q4. International growth, your comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q3, if that was your point. 28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite a bit by Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of locales. Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting to gain more and more traction there. So that is probably more of a help to Q3 than a discussion of any weakness in Q4. So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in the international countries as well and also in that numbers. In India, India continues to be a good story for us. We feel that it's had a lot of growth in the past year. In fact, more Prime members joined India's Prime program in the first year than we've seen in any other country in the history of the world, our world. So the selection is also increasing Prime eligible selection is up over 25 million items, launching Video there and also continuing to add other Prime benefits such as Prime Music will be coming soon, Amazon Family is there, as I said, Prime Video, and we had our first Prime Day in India. So that's a little bit on international growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. First one, in the press release, you talked about the strength of the Prime member growth in 2017. Could you talk a little bit about to the -- what you're seeing in growth in Prime subscribers in the United States at this point? And are you still seeing a similar tick up in consumer spending as they come into Prime as you have in the past? And the second one , Brian, to go back to an earlier question on areas of investment this year, you didn't talk a whole lot about kind of new categories to expand into beyond the old retail business. I'd be curious to hear about your investment needed to go into logistics, health care and kind of new areas you haven't really cracked into as hard yet.\nDave Fildes: Yes, this is Dave, thanks for the answer the question, Brian. Just on the first piece, in terms of just Prime membership and Prime behavior, we continue to see that we're seeing sign-ups from memberships at a strong clip. When we look at the year-over-year growth in paid Prime members on a global basis, it's been consistent in Q4 year-over-year, similar growth rates year-over-year to what we've seen in some of the earlier quarters of this year. So that's, of course, a mix of strength in the U.S. and also strength in some of the newer markets that we've launched or introduced the Prime program in. We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the program, their purchasing patterns of change and they do spend more as they move into the program. And of course, our focus is -- continues to be on adding some of the features around Prime that Brian's been talking about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like Fulfillment by Amazon, which continues to be a fast grower for us.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, and on new businesses or expansion of categories, as you discussed, I would not talk to anything that's not been publicly announced, but on some of the ones you mentioned, they are underway and are continuing. I've said logistics, we will continue to build our logistics capability both -- and that will be all the way to end delivery. We've been able to increase service levels in many cases by delivering ourselves. And although we have a strong partner network here, we will always be able to leverage our strength and our knowledge about where shipments are going, both within our network and to final customers that will create opportunities for us there as we increase or better the customer experience as well. I would say on the category side, that the biggest effort will be on continuing to be on groceries and consumables with the Whole Foods acquisition and again, we continue to look at our whole offering of AmazonFresh, Prime Now, Whole Foods, how can they work together to create better and better offerings for our customer base. And to a lesser extent, versus grocery, I would say we continue to build our business, B2B businesses, and very happy with the initial performance there with a number of the companies and universities that we've been working with and their initial results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.\nScott Mushkin: Hey, guys, so I wanted to go back to, and I think you said one of the biggest focuses of the year is going to be on the consumables now, Fresh, Whole Foods. There's been a lot of press on the Whole Foods front, the out-of-stock issue and then clearly, in the Now, as we've been testing it, the Fresh has the same issue. So I was wondering if you guys could talk about what the company plans to do. I mean, there is obviously the reputational risk that could come from that to kind of correct some of these issues and kind of what the view of the company is on the out-of-stock issues. Not just the Whole Foods but just generally across the consumables business in Fresh and Now.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, let me just back it to a more general statement. I'd say Whole Foods is not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers. We've made no changes post acquisition that would have impacted anything related to in stock, except perhaps the fact that the price decreases have brought up demand and there's an amount of rebalancing related to that. So I think the out-of-stock issue is that -- may be getting press or tied more to the increased demand that we're seeing and also selective weather-related restocking issues. But stepping beyond any short-term issues, the commitment is -- remains to have healthy, high-quality selection in stock for products. That's what the Whole Foods team is committed to. That's what the Amazon team, with them, is committed to, and also across any delivery channel that we have, AmazonFresh, Prime Now or Whole Foods. So where there's issues, they'll be corrected. Where there's areas we can improve our selection and delivery for customers, we'll do so. But it be something we're working on. So the immediacy, the perishability are all challenges everyone has in this area, but we're confident that we will have a good service and continue to delight customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.\nYoussef Squali: We've seen that the number of private label products on the site has increased pretty dramatically over the last 12 to 18 months. Could you speak to your private label strategy, in general? How big is that segment today? How big can it become? And just broadly speaking, how are the margins in that segment versus comparable third-party products?\nDave Fildes: Yes, thanks for the question. This is Dave. I think broadly, when we look at our strategy, it's focused on, number one, providing a broad selection for customers across a number of categories, so that they can find and buy exactly what they're looking for. When you look at private brands, it's very much meant to supplement that great selection, and we look for ways to be able to find private label items that have a high-caliber of quality, but also can bring that selection and that convenience for customers and really supplement what vendors and sellers are already providing the customers in many cases. We've not broken out kind of how significant or how large that is. I think for a lot of these initiatives, when you look across categories that would offer, many of them are still earlier stage and have been around even from kind of infancy for shorter period of time, a year, a couple of years, in some cases. Amazon Fashion is one area where you're seeing us offer a number of private apparel brands and some of the more popular lines with customers things like Good Threads, Amazon's Essentials, which is men's and women's basics; consumables, is, of course, another big area where we have the benefit of working with some of the Whole Foods private label, but also doing some of our other Amazon brands, things like Happy Belly and [indiscernible] Prime and others. So I think we'll continue to iterate on those and try to find different areas. And certainly there's other verticals that I didn't mention there that we're interested in continuing to kind of learn from customers what they want and what they're looking for there, and so we'll keep adding selection.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Wells Fargo.\nKenneth Sena: Maybe if you could just remind us of the thinking that behind keeping AWS and Retail under 1 corporate structure, and does it make sense given the scale of where AWS is right now? And then -- and I'm sorry if I have a little bit of an echo, I don't know why, but -- and we're hearing from marketers just how important Amazon is to their media strategy, so I don't know if you could just maybe talk about that a little bit more broadly in terms of the approach in your philosophy to that business.\nDave Fildes: Sure, we see a lot of value in all of our businesses. And AWS is a key component, as is the physical consumer business. The -- what I'll point out is, the management team is a common management team. The consumer business, if you will, is, if not the biggest, one of the largest customers of AWS. So we see a lot of commonality there where we, as depending on the position in the company, on the consumer side, the use of AWS is -- has driven great infrastructure efficiencies just like other companies see when they use AWS, turning fixed costs into variable costs and pooling resources and not having a lot of trapped capacity throughout the company and taking advantage of all the new services and features. So as an internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS. And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services. So it's a good combination for a lot of reasons, and we see no reason to change the structure that we have.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, and sorry, Ken, your second question was?\nKenneth Sena: Yes, the second question was just on the advertising side. And we're just hearing so much more how important Amazon is to broader media budgets. And so just hoping to get maybe a little bit more color just on your approach to the business right now, some of the drivers behind the recent success and just maybe just more of a sort of, as you look out over the next few years, kind of how important do you see this business becoming in the grand scheme of things?\nDave Fildes: Yes, I mean, I think right now, we're really just focused on finding ways to work with those companies, whether it's vendors or sellers that are coming to us, and offer them a great experience on the website and ability to be able to reach customers. So I think there's more to come on that side. As we said, we're definitely seeing some strong growth in our advertising revenues as part of the other revenue line item. And I think we're going to keep building more and new tools based on what we're learning from our customers there to better serve in the future.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, I think we're also point of a key lien in from brands and agencies into the e-commerce marketing space. So it's other side, search or social marketing, it's really helping them engage customers on a high, efficient, highly efficient manner.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2017, "date": "2017-10-26 21:26:02", "content": "Executives: Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments in response to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2017 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe, today, to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: At this time, we will open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the Whole Foods integration, how you see that contributing to the bottom line over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the strong AWS results, but unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at the rate it was in the past. Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past? Thank you.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Justin. This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. There's some disclosure to (03:57) unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement. So when you look at that for the three months ended, around 34%, 35% for (04:05) and, historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is a big and leading contributor (04:12) signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that (04:18). That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services (04:30) instances where those customers can pay for services upfront in some cases and discounts over multi-year periods. What we're seeing more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece. We launched month-to-month Prime last year and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go, so there's less that's deferred. So that's, I think, one of a number of factors. So, there's obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces that I just mentioned, but we have seen that monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program. So, that's part of what you're seeing.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And your question about Whole Foods, we're really excited to have them as part of the team now after the acquisition in late August. What you see in the financial results for this quarter is, it's shown actually in the new physical stores revenue component, $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating income. And that's where you'll be seeing the Whole Foods revenue showing up. In addition, that is, the cost of revenue, physical stores revenue is going to be where we're going to book any sales where the customer physically selects an item in a store. So, it will also include, or does include our Amazon Books. But if you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores, launching the Whole Foods private label products on Amazon, the technical (06:07) work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores. So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're really excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. I guess I'll ask two as well. The first one is that was a bit of unusual upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. What most surprised you in the quarter? You have been pretty consistent on how you reported versus your guide, so something unusual happened or somewhat unusual happened, what would you attribute that to?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, we talked about that on the last call. But it really carried into the quarter. We had a record day for sign-ups for free trials for Prime in Prime Day globally, had a very strong Prime Day in particular internationally. So, it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I would point mostly to those factors. It was also a very strong quarter for AWS. Revenue growth was the same as Q2, and now we're at an $18 billion run rate, whereas last quarter when I had this call, we were at $16 billion, so very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then, briefly, on the international retail, that growth also by itself was intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets, geographic markets, you would call out there?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, I would \u2013 yeah, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the impact of Souq obviously, this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally, and it carried through the quarter, but generally, I would point to the increased selection. A lot of the building blocks that we've been working on, all the Prime benefits, advancements in free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits would drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but it was stronger than probably I anticipated.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering could you talk about one or two of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just the strategic opportunities you see of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business. And the second one, on the subscription revenue, you accelerated to 59%. Could you just talk about which countries or which regions are driving that? And maybe talk a little bit about the growth or the cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date and what I can tell you is I have been in meetings with John Mackey and his team, and they are very like-minded with us, customer-obsessed, ready to work together to continue their mission and expand on their offerings that we can offer customers. The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now, and Whole Foods as we can explore different ways to serve the customer. So, that's kind of the early report on Whole Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after the summer of closing the deal. On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had essentially 59% growth, as you said, 600 basis points higher than Q2. In this line item, is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services for digital music, digital video, audiobooks, e-books, so there's some moving parts in there. The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships, and as I said, we had the largest new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction and is an attractive option for a lot of people. And again, on the other subscription services, music especially, it works just so well with our Echo device that we're seeing a lot of growth in that area as we increase the number of Echo devices and customers using the Echo devices.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. In the comment in the release on seasonal workers, that looks roughly flat year-on-year. I wanted to know if you could understand a little bit more about the trajectory around the workers needed to fulfill seasonal holiday demand and what that might also mean for automation or efficiency benefits you're getting inside your fulfillment centers? Thanks so much.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, Eric, this is Dave. I think we put out a release, I think, earlier this quarter talking about 120,000 operations folks to bring into our fulfillment centers this year. So, we're continuing to hire and hire across a number of locations. We talked earlier this year about expecting to see a greater than or \u2013 roughly or greater than 30% square footage growth in operations. So, we're certainly hiring to support that. More of these facilities do have Amazon Robotics and certainly that helps with the efficiencies there, but it requires a tremendous effort from a number of our folks as well, and so we'll continue to hire there.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: While we're on this subject of head count, head count grew 77% year-over-year in the quarter. That includes the impact of the Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions. Without those, without that head count, the base Amazon grew 47%, which is still up from 42% in Q2. So a lot of the additional pickup in Q3 was tied to our ramp for the holidays. We continued to hire a lot of software engineers. We continued to hire a lot of sales reps and it's tied directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I was hoping you could help us understand how, at this point, you're prioritizing expansion into new product categories. In particular, there's a lot of talk now about potentially using Whole Foods stores for a physical pharmacy presence and also that you've perhaps gotten approvals across multiple states in that category. Can you just help us understand the approach in general to new categories and pharmacy in particular? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, I can't confirm or deny any of the rumors related to pharmacy or anything else. I will say we do see a lot of opportunity with Whole Foods. As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. So, there will be a lot of integration, a lot of touch points and a lot of working together as we go forward. And we think we'll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods. Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, and the opportunity that that technology presents. We have on campus bookstores. So, we are experimenting with a lot of formats. I think that Whole Foods really gives us a vast headstart on that and a great base. And a great team to work with who has a lot of history and a lot of \u2013 they probably have 10 years to 20 years of learnings that we don't have and wouldn't have. So, we're really excited about that and I think working together, will bring our different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of customers.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. The other category which includes advertising accelerated 58% in the quarter. I think the common view there is that that's a fairly high margin business, certainly higher than corporate average. Is there any reason why that isn't the right assumption to make? Essentially what impact is the growth in the ad business having on the company's overall profitability? And in terms of the increased losses in the international retail segment of the business, can you provide some color around how much of that's being driven by Amazon launching into new markets, which I know you continue to do, versus investing more heavily in existing markets?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the revenue. So you're right, other revenue grew 58% in the quarter. And that includes advertising services and other things such as our cobranded credit card agreements. Advertising revenue continues to grow very quickly and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there. But I would say, generally, we're very pleased with the advertising business. Our goal here is to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping and selection choices. We'll also provide \u2013 and giving them targeted recommendations, so making it helpful for customers rather than intrusive. And then we believe that by creating that growth (17:19) and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers. So, it's an important part of the flywheel and so it's the traffic and the customers, especially the Prime customers that come to the site, are really the ones that we can use to help them select items and use advertising to help make their decisions more informed when they're picking products. On the international, yeah, I can't split it, the effects, but I will tell you again, it is international expansion and primarily in India where we're continuing to add benefits. And we launched Prime there a year ago, if you remember, and we've had more Prime members join in India than in any other country in the first 12 months. We have free shipping on 10 million items there and we're continuing to add benefits; Prime Video, Amazon Family. We had the first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music, Amazon Business is also expanding in India. So, a lot of positive momentum and investment going on in India, very pleased with that. We also recently announced Echo and Alexa are available in India. So that should be well received by the Indian consumer base. But excluding India and Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the continued growth in the other countries that we have been in for a while, continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh. In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers. So becoming more engaged and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing free shipping offers and also speed of shipping offers. So, there's a lot of different influences there. You saw the growth rate. We believe that it's resonating with customers. So, we will continue to invest and think that we have a good path forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Two questions. There's been some news flow recently about Brazil expansion. Can you just talk about how Brazil compares to maybe some of the other international markets that you're investing in? What level of investment should we expect in Brazil maybe relative to like in Australia or in India? And then a follow-up on the Whole Foods, so do you feel like the store footprint at 460 odd scores is adequate? Or any color on plans to expand either the Whole Foods store footprint or the Amazon Books stores or those other ones you mentioned? Thank you.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, Ross. Thanks for the question. This is Dave. On Brazil, just briefly, yeah we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. It's a third-party marketplace offering. You may recall we've been in Brazil for a number of years now, initially launched with really a Kindle and e-books offering without the sort of physical categories and, more recently, added physical books again, a third-party marketplace offering. So, I think, we're excited about the electronics getting out there. There is a wide variety of products included in that category: smartphones, tablets, cameras, TVs, what have you. So, I think, we're really excited to get that technology out there for Brazilians. And I think beyond that, we really just focus on those categories and growing selection there, but I can't speculate on what we might do in the future there.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And on Whole Foods, yes, I believe the total is 465 stores or thereabouts. And we have 12 bookstores now. We are adding a few more in the near future in California, Washington DC, and Austin. So, yeah, you will see more expansion from us. We're not ready to announce what that will look like and we are working with the Whole Foods team on how many more stores we might have in that area. But still early, so those plans will develop over time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, Brian. I understand you can't comment on rumors one way or the other but curious, as you think about categories like health care and, obviously, you guys are already in health care to some degree through Amazon Business, can you give us a bit of a status update on what you do have out there now? And particularly how the company and management thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time, how you would approach that versus a standard category that you might go into or maybe again knowing you can't comment on rumors, how you have approached that in the past or in other markets. And then to the extent that we're thinking about AWS growth in the fourth quarter, you guys are lapping the price cuts from last year and, obviously, have about an 800-basis-point easier comp Q3 to Q4, taking those two things into consideration, how should we think about AWS growth through the end of the year?\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, Heath. This is Dave. I'll take that first question in relation to health care. I think where you're seeing us do some work in that, I think, is on the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now, and so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they are hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies, I mean, there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that. And so, I think what you're seeing us do is really focus on services that meet those businesses multi-user accounts, improving approval workflow tools and just more recently, we introduced Amazon Business for Business Prime Shipping, which we think will be a great way for businesses to use multiuser \u2013 business customers have multiuser accounts, and that's in the U.S. and Germany. So, I think it's part of that offering, and we will really have to see how that evolves. And the other side, too, is certainly health care is one of many sectors as part of Amazon Web Services that are important customers that we are focusing on and building tools for. So probably nothing specific to call out on that one, but that's a lot of what you're seeing from us today.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, on AWS, we don't provide segment level estimates, but we did consider in our guidance the impact of the price cuts last year. You're right, we had a number of price cuts timed about around December 1 of last year. That certainly had an impact on Q4 of last year. But again, price cuts and not only price cuts but new products that have lower average cost and can cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business all the time in AWS. So we're looking forward to a strong Q4 and re:Invent is in December or the end of November, early December, so that is also an exciting time of year for the AWS business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nScott William Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I had two, please. First, Prime Now, Fresh, Prime Pantry, and Whole Foods, they're all distinct offerings, but it does seem like there's natural overlap with the potential to be further connected. And I was just wondering if you could just speak to how we should think about those four as distinct product offerings in the future versus being more integrated and possibly even in some cases, eliminated to remove overlap from a customer experience standpoint. And then secondly, given the recent management changes in video, Brian, I was just wondering if you could speak to any strategic shifts in video or changes in the pace of content portfolio build in coming years? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with video. And I just want to be clear. We're going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018. And why are we going to do that? It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers. It continues to drive better conversion of free trials, higher membership renewal rates for existing subscribers and higher overall engagement. We're seeing the engagement go up year-after-year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits. We also know Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon. And we have a lot of data where that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns, and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the two together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make mid course corrections. So we always do that. We're always changing the emphasis and looking for those more impactful shows, more shows that resonate better with our customer base, and things they want to see. So that will always be an important part of our Prime offer, and we'll continue to use the data that we have to make better and better decisions about where to invest our dollars in Prime Video. So we remain very bullish on the video business, and we're looking forward to a lot of interesting new projects at the back-end of this year and also lined up into next year. On the, sorry, the second comment was, oh, the overlap. Yes. So Whole Foods, I think I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but specifically Prime Now and also AmazonFresh. And we're going to work to see how we expand those offerings, and in some cases combine them. We're not sure how it'll play out. But we're going cooperate across those different customer touch points and trying to make them better for customers. We know customers are going to buy, just like in the physical world, sometimes you go to a convenience store, sometimes you go to a supermarket, sometimes you go to a superstore. Sometimes you need things within an hour, sometimes you can wait days for shipments. So there's no one paradigm for all customer engagement, and we're looking for the ones that resonate best with customers and we're going to continue to work on those.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. I'll actually ask two, if I can. Just any way you can comment on the increase in Whole Foods traffic after the close? And then second, talk about your desire to have an ad supported business on Fire TV or through Prime Video? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start on traffic. So we're not disclosing traffic figures. Whole Foods will be issuing a final 10-K early next month. So you'll see a better perspective on the entire quarter. The quarter that, or the four week period that you see running through the Amazon P&L this quarter is pretty hard to draw conclusions on other than revenue at this point. But Dave, do you have more on the...?\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, Jason, this is Dave. On the ad supported question, I think what you've seen to-date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer, as a Prime Video member and watching content, we view that as you've paid into that service and able to watch those shows ad free. There may be instances where you're viewing a first episode and there's an ad leading into that if it's the first free episode, but generally we like to have that as customers have paid into that program and they'll be able to enjoy that without interruption.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about delivery and just over the last several months, we've seen a lot of announcements and products around delivery options between Lockers, the testing of the Kohl's partnership, Whole Foods obviously, Amazon Key came out recently, just wanted to better understand this investment. Is this a result of, or the thesis that more options could drive obviously more sales on the flip side, do you think you're losing sales by not having those options? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Probably a little of both. We think that especially as we get into more and more Amazon Logistics deliveries, we're going to experiment with different ways to deliver things that make it easier on consumers, things that cut down on potential theft on doorsteps, but really it's mostly about increasing convenience for them.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's right. In terms of overall investments there.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And the other investments obviously are on the -maybe on the bigger-ish things or like planes and transportation capacity in general. There our philosophy is, again, we are going to watch out for our customers, we're going to build capacity that gives them great service 12 months a year but particularly at holidays. By investing in those transportation options, we do so at same cost or cost parity I would say at the very minimum. But it also allows us to do interesting things like extend cut off times for customers. It enables Sunday delivery, enable better weekend delivery. So we're seeing a lot of benefits, just the ability to stretch the order cut off from what once was 3 PM in the afternoon to midnight. Has huge benefits for both the customer and also for Amazon. It results in incremental sales and it also builds that trust that when you need something, Amazon is going to be there for you. And I need to remind you that the Thursday Night Football Game will start in two hours and 20 minutes, so...\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: On that, thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2017, "date": "2017-07-27 20:23:37", "content": "Executives: Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: At this time, we will open up the call for questions. We ask each caller please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense on the investments that are planned in Q3. Previously, you've been willing to provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering those or in terms of the ones that are the largest areas of investment in the quarter. I'm just wondering if you could update us on that given the guidance for Q3 and what we saw in investment in Q2.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing for the Q4 holiday peak. The other dynamic is that, similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3. So, to give that some perspective, the Amazon-fulfilled network, or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was that last year, and it's continued through this year. Last year we added 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went into service in the back end of last year. And that's what I mentioned about this time last year. The similar dynamic this year, we are going to have about 80% of our increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year, so that's a major increase. The other comment I would make is on the video content. Video content last year, I highlighted the fact that it was going to be a significant step up between second half of 2016 and the second half of 2015. We are still \u2013 we lapped that most of the first half this year and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year-over-year basis in Q3, and that's included in this guidance. Other than that, can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain the increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business. I will also point out that the strong usage growth in AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in capital leases to build the capital leases in the trailing 12 months. They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing \u2013 accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's additional factor sequentially in the quarter year-over-year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nColin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. A question on the grocery category and the announcements that we have \u2013 that we heard recently. Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about adding different modes such as pick up points and bricks and mortar as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful. Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they are very customer-centric, just like us. They've built a great business, focus around quality and customer. So we're really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about what the place of Amazon Fresh, likely Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there'll be no one solution, so we're experimenting with a number of the formats from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh. And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen so far. We think it's a valuable \u2013 all those are valuable services, Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality customer service to this offering.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. A couple of questions. It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you may have stepped up spending in the second quarter. Anything in particular to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is that a positive use of capital going forward? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program. Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that business as well. And gross margin expanded 130 basis points. So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits. We did see a big jump in head count in year-over-year. You'll see it's 42%, and in the past, I'd say most of that is driven by operations hiring. I've even said that headquarters or office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth. Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. So, yes, the growth rate of those two job categories actually exceeded the company growth rate. So we are adding \u2013 having success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important programs and customer-facing efforts. On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical bookstores and I would say that the benefit there is again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about a third of the people were standing around the device table learning how they work, how they interact with devices. So, I saw firsthand the customer experience, I think, that's what we're seeing as a benefit to the physical stores right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. A question on the comments around the fulfillment investments. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is kind of incremental, is geared towards handling growth and sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good. Can you just comment about the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2 and if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. Let me start with the second one. So, yes, we've had numerous price decreases, and we continue to have that in the AWS business, both absolute decreases in service costs and also rolling out new services that may be cannibalizing more expensive other services that we provide. So, nothing really to note on Q2 or Q3 from that standpoint. The fulfillment investments, I can't split it out for you between Amazon logistics support sort centers and fulfillment centers. What I can say, the biggest dynamic going on again is that Amazon fulfilled unit growth of nearly 40%, which was last year and carrying into this year. It's a global number and we are very glad to have the success of the FBA program. We are matching that with just over 30% increase in square footage, and you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and things that are incremental and new functions for us, if you will. But that's about all I can say on that right now. I think we're very happy with the FBA program. It's impact on Prime and we think Prime and FBA are self-reinforcing. We know customers really like it, the additional selection that FBA provides. So we like those combined, and we are working very hard to match that with capacity in an efficient manner.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on AWS, and just on the back of the price cut, obviously 1Q being the first full quarter, but it looks like 2Q, as Mark said, things did stabilize some. Can you just talk about whether you're seeing more of a volume pickup response here and companies kind of more actively moving volume into the cloud at these lower prices? And then just secondly, on Prime, the value of a Prime subscription for the consumer seems to continue to increase as you add more features in there. Can you just talk about your view around the flexibility of the price of annual Prime subscription? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On the price of Prime, I have nothing to add at this time. We think that the \u2013 we are increasing the value of the Prime program every day. So it becomes more and more valuable and again, as we've said, it's the best deal in retail. On AWS, yes, we are seeing great customer adoption. Again, as I said earlier, the run rate's gone up from $14 billion to $16 billion in Q2, and also we had the largest sequential and year-over-year dollar rise in revenues. Our usage in all of our large services are actually accelerating and they're growing at a rate higher than our revenue growth. So, you're seeing great adoption. We are seeing AWS customers migrate more than 30 databases over the last year-and-a-half. We signed some very big customer wins, like Ancestry, High Tail, California Polytechnic State University and others, that we're very proud to have. So, yes, the momentum in the business is very strong. We continue to open new regions. We'll be opening five regions in the near future in France, China, Sweden, Hong Kong and a second government cloud region in the East. So, yes, we like the momentum in that business. Stepping back, I would say that while pricing is important, again, we're generally being selected because of our functionality and pace of innovation, the innovation keeps accelerating. It did in the first half of this year, the pace of new services and features. We also know the customers value our partner and customer ecosystem and really the experience we've had, we've been at this longer than anybody else.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. I want to stick with AWS, please. So the AWS revenue growth showed almost no change but the AWS operating margin was lower I guess than we've seen in, I don't know, six quarters or something like that. I find that a little surprising but then I also saw that the tech and content came in materially heavy, I think, versus our and I assume other expectations. So could you just talk about that a little bit, the profitability, if there's anything that's changed in the profitability of AWS? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Those margins, as we say frequently, are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and always going to be a net of investments, excuse me, price reductions and cost efficiencies that we drive. So I would say the biggest impact in the margin that you're seeing in Q2 is really around the 71% increase in assets acquired under capital leases. Most of that is for the AWS business. So we've really stepped up the infrastructure to match the large usage growth and also the geographic expansion. And that is showing up in tech and content. On the marketing, if you look under the marketing expenses, they are also up, and that is driven by the increases we're seeing in the sales team both in AWS and advertising. So I would point to those two as probably larger than normal impacts on Q2 operating margin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, as you continue to add more Prime Now markets with one to two-hour shipping, can you just talk to some of the logistical challenges that you've already encountered and worked through? And talk to kind of if you really do see one to two-hour shipping become a larger piece of the business over the next year, what's the biggest challenge you have to make sure that you manage? And the second one on the subscription revenue, it looks like subscription revenue growth was strong again, over 50%. Could you just talk to what drove that acceleration? Was it Prime? Or is there something else in there? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with your second question on the subscription revenue. It grew 53% year-over-year versus 52% in Q1. So, we continue to see strong Prime membership growth. That is the main thing. There's also \u2013 in that line item are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other subscription services like audiobooks, e-books, digital video and digital music. Again, I would say that we're very happy with the Prime membership growth and it has remained pretty consistent both in Q4 and then through Q1 and Q2 of this year. On your second question on Prime Now, so Prime Now is now available in 50 cities across eight countries. We do learn. It's something to do in every city and have different \u2013 slightly different shapes and sizes of those buildings and different density profiles. And so we are learning as we go, learn as we grow internationally as well. That is a service that customers love. That's not an inexpensive service, though, and we also have \u2013 so we're constantly working on our cost of delivery and our route densities. And again, we like what we see and we'll continue to expand that and we'll be working very hard on making that not only a valuable Prime offering, a Prime benefit, but also a lower-cost operation as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good afternoon, Brian. I think I heard you earlier say that your head count for advertising salespeople is growing faster than the company as a whole, or company's head count growth rate as a whole. I would just like to use that maybe as a springboard to talk a little bit about what you think the right mix is for how you sell in terms of self-service versus salespeople. And then a second one would just be a quick one. I know it's early, but be curious to see what you're seeing with users of the Echo Show, with the screen on it, and if you're seeing any particularly different type of user behavior there versus the original devices with that one. Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes. It's early on the Echo Show. As you know, we just started shipping those in late June, but we're very excited about the potential and the addition of the video screen and the messaging capability and video capability. So it's \u2013 I've used mine, it's awesome. It's a big step up in my mind, but we'll get more customer feedback as we go along. On advertising, technically what I said is the sales force has grown higher than the rate of growth in the business itself, which was 42% regular head count and that sales force is primarily AWS and advertising. So, we built self-service tools and obviously we want to make those as efficient as possible for customers and advertisers, but we realize that we will need actual sales contact with the accounts as well. So it's a mix. I can't get into the split, really, but I would see both growing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two. One, with respect to international margins, is there anything there you can give us in terms of rank order or color, whether it be geographies or category expansion that we should be thinking about that are driving some of the cost curve in the international side of the business? That would be number one. Number two, stock-based comps stepped up a lot, both quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year. Wanted to know if there was anything either organic or inorganic that was driving that step-up in stock-based compensation. Thank so much.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I'll start with the second one. Yes, as you noted in the press release or the 8-K, we had an absolute step-up from Q1 of $792 million to Q2 of $1.2 billion. So it increased 51% year-over-year in Q2 versus a head count increase of 42%. I'll also say that we generally see a step-up from Q1 to Q2 because we do our employee RCU grants in Q2 of each year. So that's a normal trend. But the 51% year-over-year is also \u2013 it's a combination of the hiring we've done but also an adjustment we made to our estimated forfeiture rate. We're seeing less forfeitures, which is a great sign for our employee retention, but you have to make adjustments to your reserves as you see that. So that was another influence in Q2. On operating margins internationally, I would step back and say a lot of the investments we're making in North America we're also making in international. Prime benefits including Prime Video and remember we launched Global Video in Q4 of last year to 200 countries, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and FBA to make Prime more attractive, and the fulfillment and logistics costs that go with that, and the additional constant effort to reduce prices and accelerate shipping. So that all impacts both North America segment and international. The North America segment is a little further along in the Prime, excuse me, yes, the Prime membership growth curve. And so in some respects we are giving benefits earlier in the lifecycle to international Prime customers than we did in North America just because it launched later. And there's also India, as I mentioned, we continue to invest in India. We're very hopeful with the progress we've made with sellers and customers alike in India and we see great momentum and success there, so we continue to invest and we have some of our best people in that business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, guys. You mentioned before just stand of new fulfillment centers, it takes a bit of time for them to ramp optimization. How should we think about that path optimization over a year or so? As you continue to scale operations and you bring data to bear and robotics and Kivas and AI machine learning, are you finding that kind of new fulfillment center optimization curve is accelerating?\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Brian. This is Darin. Yes. We're getting more efficient every time we put new capacity into the network, whether that's through automation or just through the experience we've gained over the years. We still say it takes up to three years or three peaks to get to kind of network efficiency for a new particular facility, and that's about the same although the whole network gets sufficient over time. So there's a big mix going on, and we like the new innovation that we're bringing to the capabilities, but that ramp still stays about consistent as it was.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from line of from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Just one, other slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53% year-over-year. Anything to call out? And then just you made a comment about physical stores and reaction to one other question that was really about showcasing new devices. Is it fair to say that probably means locations would have small footprints versus large footprints if you're thinking about that? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: I'm sorry. What was the first part of your question?\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: The other, other revenue slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53%. Is there anything to call out around that?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: No, nothing in that other line item. It's advertising and also other things like cobranded credit card agreements. I would say that advertising revenue growth has been strong and fairly consistent over the past three quarters. So that number will move around, but there's other things in it that more the variance and the volatility is in the other line items. Your question on stores, we are \u2013 again, I personally think the new devices, the ability to see new devices is a great asset, but I don't want to shortchange the rest of the bookstore and the ability to have curated selection and the creativity we've had in taking new look at the bookstores. So we are experimenting with different formats, and we look at different sizes and we look at revenue cost per square foot just like any other physical retailer. So, we haven't essentially nailed the model yet, and we continue to experiment to see what works and how it differs by city or more suburban locations.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: So thank you, Brian, and thank you all for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website through at least the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2017, "date": "2017-04-27 21:09:16", "content": "Executives: Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting rule that we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to re-classify excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities. And as a result, you will see an increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency for stock-based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity. This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share. Specific changes are presented in the footnotes to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release. Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form 10-Q. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question\nOperator: At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. . Thank you. Our first question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.: Got it. I saw on the front page of the release you're really focused on India. Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on how far you're willing to take the investment levels there? And what are your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make progress? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that nine months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced A-Team in the original TV series and we're customizing the content, so it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public. You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was \u2013 a new version of it was launched in India with some important features there such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for three months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there.\nJustin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.: Any thoughts on how much it is impacting your international profitability?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I can't quantify it, or break it out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So, keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories. We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we see in North America to other countries. We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business B2B business just opened up in the UK. We have Amazon Devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth. Last year we said that was a 40% \u2013 nearly 40% growth worldwide. So we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Two questions. The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not big books view of the margins, I get that. But it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time, and then they dipped down. Just could you explain that? And then secondly on these \u2013 on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within households? Are you seeing it have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, pantry products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the Echo products but the ability to use tablets, our tablets now as Echo devices, since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is a theme of your questions. That's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement \u2013 as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us. So, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of momentum there and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin. So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investments. So right now, we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us. And we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said customers \u2013 the things customers love can grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades. So in that category, and some of the things that we're investing the most in are as you say the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally. Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all expanding globally. And we have launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity. We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones. We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So \u2013 and that's of course another area is AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list, and I can keep going. But I think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Amazon always had a pretty big focus on efficiencies. I'd be curious if you could talk about examples or areas where you have been able to iron out inefficiencies in the fulfillment process. And any still existing examples where you see low hanging fruit to really improve fulfillment efficiency? And then back to the point on investment. You didn't mention brick and mortar at all. There's been a lot of mention in the press about Amazon brick and mortar. I guess it would be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick and mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure thing. So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas. That technology continues to improve, and we have \u2013 we're now multiple generations down. We just launched am Amazon Robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently, and I toured that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that Amazon Robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result. The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we add things like sort centers. It's a collaboration and the movement between warehouses and sort centers and then to the end customer. The ability to have control through our sort centers has allowed us over the last few years to extend our cutoff times from 3:00 p.m. in most cases till midnight. So, greater control of our processes. If we do it cost effectively can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for our customers and their ordering pattern. So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here. One of the benefits of rapid growth is the ability to create leverage on purchases and a lot of the processes that we run. So, your second question was on stores. Yes, I think you're seeing the expansion of our bookstores. We have six bookstores right now, and we have announced another six. The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle, and while that's not large and only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. We think that has a lot of potential. Again, it's only one location that's still in beta. But along with the bookstores, we also have \u2013 you'll see us in pop-up stores and college pickup points. So, for us it's another way to reach the customer and test what resonates with them, and we're pleased with the results.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I think you mentioned the accelerating growth within AWS on new products and last year you added about 1,000. Can you just talk about maybe the plans for AWS and product growth going forward here in 2017 and the focus on innovation? Thanks\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say the innovation pace continues to accelerate. We are very proud of the launches in Q4. The Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service capability to customers, and Amazon Chime, which we also believe will resonate with customers. We've had a lot of adoption of our new services. We've had \u2013 customers migrated more than 23,000 data basis using the AWS Database Migration Service since that launched last year. And just generally we continue to expand geographically. We have announced additional availability zones and regions worldwide. So, again, signed a number of big customers. I guess I would point out in the quarter, Liberty Mutual, Snap and Live Nation all starting relationships with us or expanding their current relationship. We're now over a $14 billion run rate. We're happy with the business and the team, and again, for us innovation is going to be key as we move forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, I had a couple questions about your growing advertising business. We see more and more of it appearing on the site. And I was interested to hear a little bit more about how you expect that business to roll out internationally. I think it's largely U.S. based today, but be curious to hear about that. And then second, I think it's fairly obvious why someone selling within the Amazon ecosystem would be interested in promoting on the platform, but maybe tell us a little bit about maybe over the long-term there are opportunities for sort of non-endemic advertisers within your platform. Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, it's pretty early in the days with advertising, but we're very pleased with the team we have and the results. Our goal is to be helpful to consumers and enhance their shopping or their viewing experience with targeted recommendations, and we think a lot of the information we have and preferences of customers and recommendations help us do that for customers. We have a sponsored product, it's off to a great start, and it's a very effective way for advertisers to reach those especially interested customers. While you're on the topic of advertising, I thought I'd point out that in other revenue, advertising is in other revenue, as is co-branded credit card agreements and also some other advertising services. That decelerated from 99% in Q4 to 58% in Q1. But the fluctuation and the volatility was essentially in the co-branded credit card agreements and the other services, which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on contract terms. And that's what happened. Advertising remained strong and was consistent growth with Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. So you periodically disclosed usage growth for AWS. But it has been some time since we saw one. So we're wondering if you can update us in terms of where you are now. If not, I mean, should we think about the growth in your cash deployment as an indicator of the ongoing growth? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. Sorry, I don't have a usage number to share with you today. If it will help, I will tell you that, again, we're now over $14 billion run rate. You clearly see our \u2013 we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had seven price decreases that were timed for December 1. So, about a third of the impact of those was seen in Q4, and then again that's one element of the sequential operating margin. But in general, we're very happy with that team and the progress they're making. And we're deploying more capital as you can see to support the usage growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask you about CapEx. It looks like CapEx including leases more than doubled year-over-year. So I know you listed kind of a long list of the many investment opportunities here, but can you just point out anything else in particular that drove the pretty substantial increase there? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was \u2013 grew 51% year-over-year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last \u2013 fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that cost of start-up is before the start-up some comes in a quarter afterwards. So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend here is that the differential between Amazon fulfilled network unit growth and paid unit growth. So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity. And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up. On the capital leases, that grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that is tied to usage growth. But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year. So certainly it was a bigger step-up in 2016 now carrying into 2017.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I know that we talked about over the last couple of quarters that part of the step-up in CapEx was to catch up from the under-investment in 2015. Just curious if you'd say \u2013 have you made a lot of progress in terms of catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the business at the beginning of last year? And then I know you just said that you're \u2013 it's still early days in terms of advertising, but there's a perception out there that over the last year or so that the company has sort of really begun to focus more on this business opportunity. Has something really changed at the business in the last year? And do you see advertising becoming a more meaningful part of the business over the near to midterm, I guess?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with advertising. So, yes, I think scale is helping. We've had great teams working on advertising for a while now. Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content \u2013 video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business. So we're very happy. I can't project it forward. But we're happy with the growth there. I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth. On your second point about fulfillment capacity; here's how I'd generally generalize it. In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services. Last year we changed some of our incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better throughput through our FCs, particularly in Q4. That combined with the step-up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really good position. We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers \u2013 for FBA sellers. So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides. So, again, they're self-reinforcing, the FBA program and also our Prime program. The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in-stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in-stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the increase in unearned revenue. Obviously, this quarter biggest increase that you have seen from at least from a dollar perspective. What does that say about the way customers are changing in the behavior in the AWS business? How should we think about the way that that might be impacting pricing, mix, near-term growth?\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Heath. This is Darin. Yeah, on a deferred revenue balances, as we've said in the past, the primary drivers of that increase are both the activity that we're seeing with our AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved Instances and prepaid credits for their account, as well as Prime member purchases. We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime, but certainly it \u2013 we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so. Certainly, the \u2013 part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances. As customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discounts on their usage. And so we like that model. Customers certainly like that model. And collecting that through deferred revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nColin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. A question on the transportation and logistics initiatives. And in particular, if you could share any of the effects or learnings thus far with air cargo. In particular, what kind of performance or cost-efficiencies that you may be realizing or expect to realize from this effort. Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, Colin. As you point out, we're \u2013 we have expanded our own fleet. We now have 18 planes in service for Amazon, and we have announced rights to lease up to 40 planes. So it's gone very well. The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up, and we think the cost is very good. So on that front, it's better control, better capacity control, especially search capacity, and also good costs. So we have great relationships with third party carriers. We will continue to and we value all our partner relationships as we develop our own capability particularly in intra-network. We're putting it to good use, as I mentioned before, with the sortation center example.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of an investment in capabilities in India at this point and how you think about that market longer term. And then secondly, also if you could just comment on the limitations and your willingness to invest more throughout LatAm the way you have more recently in markets like China and India. And if I could, just finally, you've previously discussed satisfaction with the measurements of success for the video product in terms of consumer engagement, and the effects on Prime. I was just wondering if you could comment on whether these metrics are continuing to improve as spending continues to rise on video and consumer awareness is seemingly growing as well. Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start with your middle question. I think it was about Latin America growth. Let me step back and talk about international growth in general. So our approach varies by country, and if you look, historically we've taken multiple approaches. So in China, we bought an existing business Joyo.com and built off that base. In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves. And it's always going to depend on the country that the dynamics in that country both for retail, for online, and for foreign investment. But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well. So, we pick our spots carefully. You'll see \u2013 you heard in the quarter that we've announced the intention to buy Souq in the Middle East. Where does that fit into this strategy? Well, Souq's pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for their customers and they're multiple countries, and they're doing a great job. So we see this as an example where we can learn from them, and also support their efforts with our Amazon technology and global resources. So we're in Mexico, but we're not in other parts of Latin America. We have a business in Brazil. But other countries we'll take on a case-by-case basis, again, bounded by what our management bandwidth can support and prioritization versus other things. You obviously heard my long list of investments. All of those are pretty much gated by the need for people and software engineers and strong teams to approach them. So international expansion gets played off in the same prioritization that other efforts do.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your questions.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. So is there just an accounting housekeeping a way to think about stock-based comp? You guys aren't providing that by segment anymore, but the rates of growth kind of differed by the businesses. And so is there just a way to think about, A, will that be in the queue? Or are you not disclosing it anymore? And is there a way to think about what I guess the patterns would be consistent with historical patterns by segment? Thanks.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Jason. This is Darin. Yes, we, a number of quarters back, started breaking out stock-based compensation by segment, and now we have collapsed that in our op income by segment. So it's definitely in there. We do provide some disclosure by P&L line item on a consolidated basis, that helps you identify that stock-based compensation expense in total and you'll see the trend and analysis and the metrics at the back of the press release.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I can take two away from the press release just to understand a little bit of the quarter-over-quarter cadence. On the retail subscription services, that saw a pretty big jump up in the growth rate year-on-year in Q1 versus Q4. I think that might be Prime memberships that come on to paid from trial. But just wanted to understand what maybe some of the driver was of that quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate. And net shipping costs actually grew at the slowest rate by our count in a couple of years. It looks like you're starting to get some improvements there in terms of revenue over costs on the shipping line. Just wanted to know what that was in terms of what is driving that and can we expect that to possibly continue. Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue. So there's multiple things in that category. The largest is Prime membership fees, but also other subscription services like audio books, eBooks, digital video, digital music, and other subscription services. So you're right, there was an acceleration, much like the comment I had on advertising and the other revenue category. The Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last year are relatively consistent. So the volatility is in these other items. So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1. Your comment on shipping costs, yeah, that is going to \u2013 it was lower unit volume as well, but generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tail \u2013 the headwinds are obviously going to be FBA growth and shipping more products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program and the demand for products from our Prime customers. And the demand has been great. Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to their doorstep within two days or, in some cases, next day or same day. So it's going to be a big part of our cost structure but it's an investment we work hard to reduce as far as rates, and we're glad to spend it to support our Prime program.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question will come from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich - Evercore Group LLC: Hi. Thanks. I had a follow-up and then a new question. The follow-up is, would love an update. You talked a lot about the fulfillment centers, but could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime Now facilities and sorting centers? You're just accounting a few \u2013 you feel that scenario, it's a really ramped up investment this year or what you got last year is sort of what you need?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I'm sorry. You said Prime Now and what was the other thing?\nGreg Melich - Evercore Group LLC: And the sorting centers.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sort centers. Sort centers, right. Well, I don't have updated numbers for you, but the Prime Now is available in more than 45 cities across eight countries. The Same-Day is available in 30 cities in the U.S. So, that's a bit on the quantification of those. I can't tell you much more on sort centers.\nGreg Melich - Evercore Group LLC: But were you thinking about building out the capacity? It sounds like last year, you had that big surge in fulfillment centers. There isn't a similar surge about to happen this year on some of those other areas?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. I can't project that. We're still growing that and we're happy with the progress in Prime Now and the service that \u2013 the value that it creates for Prime customers. And as I said, we have expanded internationally, which was a big goal of ours as well. So we will continue to grow that. I can't quantify it for you right now. The other similar like facility metric you might want is that AmazonFresh is now in 21 metro areas in the U.S. as well as London and Tokyo.\nDarin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thank you for joining us on our call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}], "2019": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-01-31 23:24:04", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2019 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. I guess I'll ask about units, 14% in the quarter, just, how do you feel about the overall unit growth here, given that the growth was higher last year in the 20s and do you think there are some investments you can make in other areas to kind of reaccelerate that going forward? And then secondly, just if you could remind us or help us understand the Prime accounting change impact on subscription revenues in Q4? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Take the subscription first.\nDave Fildes: Yeah. Hey, Justin, this is Dave. Just on the second question on the subscription services, we\u2019d said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018. We\u2019d said we'd anticipated about 300 million lower sort of headwind to subscription services revenue due to the accounting change. So that's where we came out for the quarter. So you'll see that, we reported subscription services revenue increased 26% when you exclude FX. So the 300 million is certainly part of that decelerate -- the sequential deceleration in the growth rate in that line item.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. And on unit deceleration, I think the unit numbers more and more require some interpretation, because it doesn't include the -- some of our fastest growing areas, the things like, as Dave mentioned, subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods units are not in that number. So we don't focus as much on the number and we direct you more to the supplemental revenue guidance that breaks out the component parts. But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter.  We think it was a, Q4 in particular was a great quarter for customers that retail, there is a lot of strength in the retail part of the businesses, the teams here had done a great job, planning, preparing and then executing on the quarter. AWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continued to deliver for customers. We had a great Reinvent Conference in the quarter. So we feel good about the growth in the quarter and also the total revenue and income.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. Just comment a little bit on the international revenue outlook and any commentary on India and whether you think there's a material impact on your business? Secondly, could you talk about advertising revenue, just qualitatively or quantitatively, how that's doing? And third, if I could, you spent a lot on marketing in the quarter, it's a real step up. Do you just want to talk about the ROI that you think you're getting on that marketing spend?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. The first question is on India. Let me start with that. So we have incorporated into our guidance estimate, the best estimate we have for Q1 in India, however, there is much uncertainty as to what the impact of the government rule change is going to have on the e-commerce sector there. We remain committed to complying with all laws and regulations, we will, but we're evaluating the situation. Our main issue and our main concern is trying to minimize the impact to our customers and sellers in India. We've built our business around price selection and convenience. We don't think the changes help in those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the sellers. Dave, why don\u2019t you talk about the advertising growth?\nDave Fildes: Yeah, yeah. I think I mean, we're continuing to -- there's a lot of focus on serving that customer set. One of the things we're trying to do is continually evolve our tools and the products to help that customer set agencies, advertisers, make sure they've got a variety of ways to meet their goals. Some of the things we've done more recently over the last few months or so is expanded sponsor brands, placements, some rolled out new campaign reports, so improved campaign manager features. So a number of -- there's a number of things beyond that, but features out there that are just going to, I think, make it easier for companies to grow with the ad tools and the ad services that we offer and we're continually excited about the opportunity there.\nBrian Olsavsky: And then on your question of marketing, yes, the marketing percent of revenue was up 110 basis points year-over-year. This category also includes AWS sales and marketing and keep that in mind, because that's where a lot of our headcount investment is going. Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year, but the areas that were growing in that mix were things like technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing. So variable marketing was pretty consistent with prior periods and we feel good about our return on investment on the marketing, the variable marketing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on India, just bigger picture, Brian, do the new policies change your view at all of the attractiveness or the potential of operating in India and how do you think about your investment strategy there in the near term? And then also just hoping you could talk about some of the impact in the US and UK from free shipping during the fourth quarter holidays?\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. Really, we're still evaluating the situation in India. We feel very good about the long term prospects in India and doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers. The new regulations need to be interpreted, need to be -- need to make sure they don't have unintended consequences. And again, I don't think it's necessarily consistent with better price, better selection and better convenience for the Indian customer. So it's not all we can say on that topic right now. \nDave Fildes: Yeah. And I think Doug, your second point was just around shipping, some of the shipping offers in the holiday. We did lower the free shipping threshold ahead in to the fourth quarter, so customers took advantage of that and that was a great offer for them in the holidays. Brian talked a little bit about it before, but pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first party side, but also sellers continuing to do well. As part of the holiday offering, we sold a number of record breaking number of Alexa devices as well and I think just in that shipping vein, really pleased with the continued engagement from Prime members, we had the most ever number of Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. So really pleased with that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.\nMark May: Thank you. When I try to back out the impact factors like Whole Foods, the advertising accounting change and other factors, what I see is stable and pretty healthy revenue growth for the retail segment, but a slowdown in Q4 from what seems to have been, in more recent quarters, meaningful gross margin expansion in the retail segment. Can you discuss what may have driven that and how to think about retail gross margins going forward? And then somewhat separately, retail margins last year benefited from several factors, including more modest hiring and more modest growth in fulfillment center capacity, do you see these factors persisting this year? Thanks.\nDave Fildes: Yeah. Thank you. Let me start with that last part, because I think if we step back and put 2018 in perspective, there are some clear trends regarding our cost structure. Starting with fulfillment costs, so in the prior two years, 2016, and 2017, we had grown our square footage tied to fulfilment and shipping by greater than 30%. In 2018, that number grew by 15%. Certainly, unit demand was lower, but AFN or Amazon Fulfilled demand were, we\u2019ve combined FBA and retail, remained strong. So we had a banking, if you will, of some large expansions in the prior two years. Similarly on headcount, we grew headcount by 48% in 2016, 38% in 2017, if you exclude the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Souq, which drove the number up to closer to 68% I believe. Last year, we were at 14% growth. And so, there was a lot of leverage and a lot of, in a way, there was a lot of pre hiring in 2017 that we digested in 2018, while we still continue, in some areas, especially things like our core retail business and also G&A functions, but then we continue to invest again in the technology tied to AWS sales team to an AWS device area. So their groups are growing considerably higher than that 14%, but on total, the company grew 14%.  And then on capital, especially infrastructure capital, if you use the capital lease slide as maybe an indicator for what we have invested into our AWS business to support infrastructure and global expansion, that number grew 10% last year, when it had grown 69% in 2017. So in a lot of ways, 2018 was about banking the efficiencies of investments in people, warehouses, infrastructure that we had put in place in 2016 and \u201917. So while we'll continue to concurrently drive growth and customer offering and Prime benefits, we certainly do take costs seriously and we will continue to work on operational efficiencies. I would expect these investments to increase relative to 2018 and we've reflected what we see so far in Q1 in our guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you. A little bit -- to dig a little bit deeper into the CapEx capital lease side of things, you guys have said in the past that generally you work to build in line with your expectations for guidance, so that you are trying not to over build or under build when thinking about your fulfilment in data center capacity. We saw that investment re-accelerate in the fourth quarter, after hitting the lows that you referenced in Q3. Anything to read into that about sort of what your expectations are for growth in those businesses, seeing that reacceleration after the deceleration that we saw over the course of at least the first three quarters of last year.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. I see total CapEx that was -- grew 33% in Q1, 1% in Q2, negative 1% in Q3 and then positive 17% in Q4, just the quarter itself. So there was, as you say, a bit of investment in Q4 relative to Q2 and Q3. I still think the 17% is a low number for us, when you talk about the -- supporting the AWS business that's still growing in a very high clip and a very strong and healthy growth in FBA and customer demand and our expansion into new countries, both with AWS and also with our core consumer business. So I am not prepared to give you the forecast for the year right now. I would say that, I would consider 2018 to be a lighter investment year and the lighter year for adding fixed headcount certainly compared to 2016 and 2017 we'll reveal that as we go through the year, but we've built into the first quarter what we expect in the first three months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just -- the first one is to go back to the fourth quarter gross margins. I think if we try to back out AWS, it looks like there was a little more gross margin pressure. Can you just talk to any of the puts and takes we should know about from a gross margin perspective in the fourth quarter and then that other line that I think includes the advertising business, can you just help us, any help at all on the growth of the advertising business or the impact of any of the accounting changes in the quarter? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Sure. I\u2019m sorry I skipped over that gross margin question earlier, but yeah, gross margins were well up 180 basis points year-over-year, were not up as much as prior quarters. I would say the positive tailwinds still remain, AWS has strong growth of 46% on an FX neutral basis. Third party units continue to grow, advertising dollars continue to grow very well. Some of the headwinds, I would say, were outbound shipping cost, including the free shipping that we did, but mostly, it was the higher Amazon fulfilled units and the greater use of Amazon logistics. And I would also say retail was very strong.  We had a, as I think Dave mentioned, the Echo Dot was the highest selling unit globally, so devices had very strong sales in the quarter. We discussed how we don't price devices to make money. We usually will expand our content, expanding our device and usage. There are a group of customers who use our devices and then we monetize that in different ways to commitment to Amazon and the video and everything else. So a bit of it was mix, but I would say this retail, which has a lower gross margin more because of the revenue treatment was stronger in Q4.\nDave Fildes: Yeah. And just on the other revenue piece, Brian, just to get back to the accounting side. We did adopt that revenue recognition standard in 2018 as I mentioned. As part of the adoption, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of cost of sales. So specific to Q4, the impact of that change was an increase of approximately $1 billion to other revenue, so you will see that in the other revenue in total.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks. I guess two for me as well. In the quarter, looking backwards, not considering India and the impact going forward, but the international growth accelerated, so I was curious any particular regions or product categories to call out, especially given some of the weakness in the UK? And then marketplace fees are changing in several categories, including Home Furnishings, health and beauty, curious what the strategy is there, I assume to expand selection, but is it also an indication of an increasing focus on those retail categories? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with your second question. Obviously, third party sellers are an important part of our value proposition there. They\u2019ve had great success on our site, the -- more than half of our units sold are from third party sellers. So it's very important to us that we have the right business profile, both for Amazon and for the sellers. So we will always be evolving that, part of that involves changing fee structures, sometimes, adding new fees or subtracting old ones, part of it involves raising or lowering fees that sellers pay. So you're going to see this continually from us. We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the incentives are strong on both sides and we continue to have a healthy growth in third party. On the international, on an FX neutral basis, the growth was 15% in Q3 and 19% in Q4. But last call, if you remember, I talked about the timing of Diwali and the impact that had on our growth rates. If we adjust for that and again Diwali had, took place primarily in Q4 this year and it was split between Q3 and Q4 last year. If we adjust for that, international growth is pretty flat Q3 to Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two if I can. First, just on the advertising side, we hear a lot of positive feedback from customers, but also we hear suggestions of their supply constraints. So, how do you guys see inventory growth versus pricing growth as a driver in that business and are there things you can do to grow inventory? And then secondly, there have been some reports, your Amazon shipping effort is kind of expanding beyond some test markets. So wondering if you can give us a sense for what you've seen in this test markets and how you think about expanding your shipping efforts on that productized basis going forward? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. Lloyd, thanks for the questions. I'll take the advertising piece first. I mean, I think as I talked before, we're working on the improving usability of tools. I mean, our priorities in the space, that's certainly one of them looking for ways to make smarter recommendations, addressing the needs of brands, automating activities, incenting new products and I think in all those regards in those priorities, we think there's some good growth to continue to come both in advertising for on our own properties, but also potentially beyond, over the longer term, so, but even as we look for advertising opportunities on places like Amazon.com, we think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of experimentation. I think we're learning and are a very data interested company and working with a lot of great brands to be able to develop better toolkits for them, understand what types of metrics they want to make them more successful based on what they're telling us.\nDave Fildes: Yeah. And on transportation, I assume you're just talking about our expansion of Amazon deliveries and Amazon logistics. Again, we have great partners in place for our business and support globally, what we do is add capacity where we feel we need to speed up service or ensure demand, particularly at peak. So we will continue to build out our DSP and flex and chip with Amazon programs. So during the quarter, it was a much bigger presence obviously year-over-year, so we're happy with that, both from a performance standpoint, the delivery estimate accuracy as we call it was very strong on our self-delivered products and also the cost profile is very good as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One on the media side, has there been any step-up in terms of investments around media content to support your ambition with respect to Prime and the video. It's been a couple of years now since we got an update on rate of spend or how it might impact either historical periods or going forward periods, that would be number one. And then number two, going back to Lloyd's question on the advertising front, how do you think about the video opportunity, you're moving beyond just branded opportunities or sponsored products search on your own properties and thinking about experimenting with over the top video or connected TV opportunities [indiscernible] going forward. Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. Let me start with video. We're not quantifying the Prime video spend today, but we do \u2013 it has been increasing. We expect it to increase even further in 2019. We're seeing a lot of again continued strong adoption and the usage and viewing and hours watched of our -- both our music and our seasoned video and music. And as a step back, it builds stronger Prime connectivity with our Prime members, at least, the higher membership renewal rates and higher overall engagement. And as we like, we see -- we continue to see that engagement growing. I would say that we've had some particular success in -- recently with 10 Golden Globe nominations and 3 Oscar nominations and Jack Ryan homecoming in season two of the [indiscernible] in particular, were very well received during the quarter.\nDave Fildes: Yeah. And then on your second question, just around advertising opportunities and around video, you may have seen it not that long ago, IMDB or Internet Movie Database, one of our subsidiaries, launched FreeDive, which is an ad supported free streaming video channel that's available in the US and it enables customers to watch TV shows and movies without purchasing a subscription. So ad supported, so that's available on the IMDB website with your laptop or personal computer on. I think it's definitely on the Fire TV devices as well is a great way to consume content.  So I think excited about that, other opportunities we've been working with in ads, video for a bit longer period of time have been things like our sports offering, some of the live sports that we've done, things like Thursday Night Football, really like the success that we've seen on those and been learning from that and looking forward to pursuing more opportunities to engage and serve with customers with those types of video offers, but also take some opportunity to monetize with the advertising.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Just two, so just can you comment, did advertising slow down relative to third quarter. One, you kind of adjusting for 606 and then secondly, was there any reallocation in segments between online and physical stores and if not any commentary why physical stores was down year-over-year? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. Thanks, Jason for your questions. Let me start with the physical stores revenues. So physical stores decreased 3% year-over-year and this is primarily Whole Foods, but also includes our other stores, the Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, Amazon 4 star. What happened in the quarter was we were lapping a period last year when we \u2013 we had purchased Whole Foods in Q3, as you remember of 2017. In Q4, we adjusted their fiscal calendar to link it up with Amazon's and it added about 5 days of revenue into Q4 of last year. So we're comping that year-over-year. The second piece is that, the -- as you said, the online orders where people go to the Prime Now app and then order for delivery or pick up at Whole Foods stores does count or is counted in the online stores component of revenues. So if you adjust for those, with the Whole Foods growth year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis was approximately 6%. Because of some of those, again, mostly the year-over-year accounting days, true up issue, it's showing up as negative 3% in physical stores.\nDave Fildes: Yeah. And then just on your second question around advertising, if you look at the other revenue, the growth rate decelerated some. So it's at 97%, still very strong, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter in other revenue as I think you're aware, there are a number of components, but the largest by a good margin is the advertising revenue and we are comping a period of rapid growth in the prior year, so that is part of the factor there as you mentioned, but I\u2019d just reiterate, we're continuing to see quite strong adoption across Amazon\u2019s vendors, sellers, authors, all types of advertisers that are utilizing that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.\nDan Salmon: Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, can we just return to your comment earlier about the increased use of Amazon logistics, not a surprise there, but just curious through the holiday season, any particular learnings that you can offer some color on and how you view the balance between using your own proprietary logistics versus third parties as you go into 2019? And then just a quick follow-up, obviously the HQ2 news came out during the quarter, what would you highlight as maybe the most important next steps there and maybe some color on the feedback from that process, I would be interested to hear that as well? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. So let\u2019s start with HQ2. Of course, in November, we announce we selected New York City and Northern Virginia and between the two cities, we will be investing $5 billion and creating more than 50000 jobs. We also announced a Operations Center of Excellence to be opened up in Nashville, which is about -- estimated to be about 5000 jobs. So right now, we're working through some next issues in both cities. We\u2019re looking forward to investing in New York and Northern Virginia and being a good community partner as well as Nashville. So not really much else to report at this time on that. On your comment or question on transportation, we do continue to expand our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well. We added, of course, we have over 100 million items that customers would get within two days, but there's now over 3 million that will be delivered within one day or faster in 10,000 cities in town. So Amazon deliveries are a big part of that. Again, we have great third party partners as well in the transportation space. What we like about our ability to participate in transportation is that a lot of times, we can do it at the same cost or better and we like the cost profile of the two.  We can also invest selectively because we have more perfect information we know where our demand is, we know where we're moving things between warehouses and sort centers and by not involving third parties all the time, we can find that we can extend our ship cut offs, or excuse me, our order cutoffs and we've done that over the last few years. So that's also another helpful side benefit for consumers when we are doing our own logistics, excuse me, transportation final delivery.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: So the AWS operating margins historically kind of move around a bit. Any color on what drove the decline sequentially from 3Q to 4Q? And then I guess going back to the investment catch up theme, it sounds like 2019 will be a little bit more aggressive push from you guys. Can you parse out whether you expect the pace of retail margin expansion that we're seeing in North America right now, is that going to continue and most of these investments are going to be in international and some of the stuff going on in India and any color on the North America operating margin trajectory? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the AWS operating margin, as you called it out. That number will move around, we're very pleased with the 29.3% that we saw during the quarter. Of course, at any point in time, this business is going to be a combination of lowering prices, expanding geographically, adding people to build, especially tech teams and sales teams to build new and innovative products and staying very relevant and ahead of our customers\u2019 minds. And infrastructure, well again, it will balance between quarters a bit.  Our capital lease expenditure in Q4 was a bit higher than the prior three quarters. That had slight impact on the operating margin, but again year-over-year, operating margins were up and were almost 280 basis points. We've said quite openly that this is going to bounce around. What we do is to create great value for the customer on one end and then work to minimize our cost of infrastructure and we're getting more and more creative around getting efficiency up and getting our cost of acquisition down.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations site at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-10-25 22:31:23", "content": "Executives: Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJustin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores, which are probably related to that. I know it's a tough 3Q comp, but could you comment a little bit about that? And then kind of what initiatives could be most interesting to maybe reaccelerate that over the next couple of years? What categories? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thank you, Justin. Yeah, let me just remind you a couple of things from last year. We had two reactions on our Super Saver Shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital content, not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited in particular. It's been really popular. I'll just remind you that the units \u2013 those do not count in our unit totals nor do the units from Whole Foods Market. So, yeah, I would say essentially with that backdrop, we're still very, very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers on the consumer side. We have Amazon fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total paid units. In-stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holiday period. I think we're well positioned for the holiday. We have over 100 million Prime eligible items that are available for FREE Two-Day Shipping for Prime members. And again, when we're talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising are not caught in that metric.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: And, Justin, this is Dave. Just to add on to that. You mentioned the online stores. Just a reminder, there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex-FX, to be higher than that, but for the adoption ad standard. So there's a little bit of a headwind there as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the international retail business. That seemed to slow down, I guess that whatever, 15% or something year-over-year. Any particularly color? Any markets that would have led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but anything else you'd call out there? Thanks a lot.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at two things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May. So the full pickup on that year-over-year was in 2017 and now we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple factors that hit the international growth area in particularly. But I also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter and now we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup. Story is different country-by-country obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are coming in from 99% of the pin codes in the country. So, great first wave of the, what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which lead into Diwali.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. You had significant operating income upside in 3Q relative to your guide. Can you just talk about the biggest drivers there in terms of outperformance? And then when you think about your 4Q outlook, how should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've talked about? And then any other one-time or special items that might be weighing on that operating income outlook? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with Q3 and this will be commentary pretty much on the whole year that was especially true in Q4. So, first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance this year in three specific areas I'll call out. So, first on head count. If you'll remember, we grew head count 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%, but without Whole Foods we still grew 38%. We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple years and as we've funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas as we've talked about, AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of those roles. So we're only up 13% on head count through nine months year-over-year. So a real step down in that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control. In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last two years, 2016 and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. Making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units. This year we're only adding about 15% to our square footage. So again, getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi-year investment that we've been making. And the last one, which is really significant, is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business, they're also for our Amazon consumer businesses, who is AWS' biggest customer. If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year, trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year, at the end of the year. So those three areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that again we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Question on AWS. Obviously in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth. This quarter, 46%, still quite strong, but dollar and percentage growth did slow. I'm just kind of curious are you just reaching a point in terms of a lot of large numbers where it will be more difficult to sustain not only accelerating growth, but sustain kind of the 40-plus-percent growth levels where we've been recently? Or was there something also going on kind of in the quarter that maybe drove that? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for your question. This growth rate is going to bounce around. We've had sequential increase in growth rate the prior three quarters, I believe, it was. This quarter is slightly down, but still 46% growth is very strong. We are at an annualized run rate above $26 billion and that was about $18 billion this time last year. So we're very happy with the growth in the business, the momentum that we're seeing with enterprise customers. And we just mentioned on the cost side, it's been a very good year from gaining greater efficiencies in our infrastructure costs.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, the fourth quarter revenue guide and the fourth quarter revenue deceleration. Maybe can you just help us understand a little bit any of the specific categories or countries that have been the largest contributors to revenue growth throughout the course of this year? And which of those are really slowing down sort of driving this potential deceleration that you're guiding to? Then the second one, you've applied robotics to the warehouses now around Kiva. Curious for your thoughts about the need or desire to invest in autonomous driving technologies to think about some of the other retailers partnering with Waymo and other players, et cetera.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me talk about guidance. So our guidance for the fourth quarter implies 10% to 20% growth and includes an 80-basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. I wouldn't point to any specific country. Once you adjust for the fact that Whole Foods, it was purchased in August of last year and that has impacted every quarter since then, Q4 will be the first solid non-Whole Foods comp since before we bought them since Q2 of last year. So if you, even factoring that, and we're looking at Q4 and we have very high error bars on the quarter. Much of our, not only our revenue for the quarter, but also for the year comes in that very tight window between middle of November and the end of the year. So it's always a very difficult period for us to estimate. What I would say is that we feel like we're in great shape for the holiday. The warehouses are very clean. We feel like we're going to have great capacity not only for retail products but also for FBA. We're going to have great capacity for shipping to our customers. So we're very ready to go. Selection should be at its highest point, especially for Prime members. So we're very bullish on the fourth quarter. And we'll just have to see how revenue comes in. I will say there's one housekeeping item on Prime revenue recognition that you should be aware of and may remember from prior quarters. This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight line method. Previously, we had done it on a, is tilted more to Q4. It's based more on shipping units. So what you've seen is a push of revenue and income from Q4 into Q1, 2 and 3 that we've mentioned on each call. This is the quarter where that will reverse. That is to scale it for you. Under the old methodology we would have had $300 million more of both revenue and operating income in the quarter. That has again been caught up for in prior quarters, but again not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, but just another item to consider. On the Robotics, I don't have much to say on autonomous driving. We are putting most of our efforts right now, continue to into our Robotics program. We think it's been a great addition to our fulfillment capacity. It makes the jobs in our warehouse that much better. It makes the people around the robots that much more productive. It allows us to have much greater density of product storage and a number of other benefits. It has some additional capital intensity, but it has good return on invested capital from our standpoint.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. With a lot of offline retailers talking more about omni-channel, wanted to understand sort of the investments you might be making around unifying the efforts with Whole Foods and Amazon Prime Now, speeding up delivery, giving consumers as much choice as possible and moving SKUs closer to households. How should we be thinking about that push in 2019 and 2020 and how that might open up new areas of wallet share for the company? Thanks guys.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, I think we've started to show our strategy on the Whole Foods side. You'll see even this quarter we started to have greater expansion of our grocery delivery out of Whole Foods using Prime Now. We're now in 60 cities in the U.S., giving customers delivery in as fast as an hour on thousands of great organic products from Whole Foods. We've also expanded grocery pickup and that's available in 10 cities. So the customers can pick up at the Whole Foods store. You'll see that we've started to tie Whole Foods into Alexa. You can build your cart using Alexa and then check out using the Prime Now app. So there's going to be a lot of, as you say, omni-channel overlap, especially in the grocery business. On the storefront, we're also, as you can see, experimenting with numerous store formats. Amazon Go is now up to six stores. We opened five in the quarter. We're getting great feedback on that. Customers love the ability to quickly walk in, select items they want and leave without waiting in a checkout line. We opened up a Amazon four-star location in New York City where we're going to test the concept of a highly curated selection of top categories across Amazon. We of course have Amazon bookstores, 18 bookstores in the U.S. So we're going to experiment with multiple ways of reaching the customer, wherever they happen to be.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRoss Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. I guess two questions. Any color on, it looks like shipping costs and maybe labor costs might see some inflation in 2019. So do you agree with that? Or what are some of the things you can do to potentially offset some of that pressure? And then, the 15% fulfillment square-footage growth, you're obviously deploying a lot of automation and there's a lot more efficiency gains in the current generation of fulfillment centers than maybe the older ones. So how should we think about a 15%? Is that not a good reading indicator on growth into 2019? Or is it \u2013 any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I think it's comparable to \u2013 last question first. I think the 15% is comparable to the 30%-plus that I mentioned in 2016 and 2017. We are debating whether the dynamics of the warehouse are changing so that square footage may not be the main indicator, might be cubic feet, but if we switch to that way of looking at it, we'll make sure that we bridge the gap on the difference between the two. But the other comment about cost, I believe you're probably referring to the U.S. rumored USPS rate hikes in transportation cost. We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019. Annual rate increases from our transportation partners is a really regular occurrence and we negotiate hard and we'll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our own shipping method. So, we don't see that as being a huge issue. On wages, of course, we did raise wages and starting November 1 just under 400,000 employees, both full-time and part-time in the U.S. and UK will be getting a substantial wage increase. So that is factored \u2013 I'm not quantifying that today, but it's factored into our Q4 guidance and it will be obviously factored into guidance into 2019.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.\nYoussef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, can you quantify the contribution of PillPack acquisition in the quarter? Maybe help us understand the strategy there. And then there is some news, reports suggesting that you guys were working on an ad supported video streaming service under the IMDb brand. Can you just help shed any more light on that, is that especially relative to your Prime Video offering? Thank you very much.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start with PillPack. The deal closed in September. So it wasn't a material impact on the quarter, but we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there. They're very strong. They've done a great job building a highly differentiated customer experience, just customer-centric like we are. And right now our focus is on learning from them and innovating with them on how best to meet customer needs over time. I'll let Dave handle the second question.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. I think, I mean, we have no plans to build an ad-supported Prime Video offering for free at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Two questions. First, I think I may have missed earlier. You gave out the impact of ASC 606. And then maybe second question, I think what one of the things people are trying to think through is you obviously guide to revenue and operating income, but as the business is more than 3P and advertising, gross profit is now much more important and just the way you kind of capture the value you provide. So maybe if you can \u2013 is there a way to just kind of help us kind of foot the perhaps slower revenue growth we're seeing versus what's obviously you extracting kind of more value for your partners and customers and for yourself? Thanks.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the ASC impact, Brian mentioned earlier that of course we've been talking about it all year the changing, and the subscription revenue recognition is now straight line. So on a comp basis you'd expect to see subscription revenue be about $300 million lower due to that accounting change. The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018. That was about $750 million increase to that other sales revenue category here in the third quarter.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And your comment on revenue versus operating income versus potentially gross profit, I would say the impact of third-party growth and we're now \u2013 up to 53% of our paid units in the quarter were third-party. It's steadily been going up. It's up 300 basis points year-over-year. So I think the impact on revenue growth rate, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period. I think it tends to not be as big a factor, sequentially quarter-over-quarter is the gradual growth in it. But again, we'll continue to give revenue guidance and also operating income to an appropriately conservative level that we've tried to maintain over time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nAnthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks very much. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on advertising and the growth opportunity there. If you can help us on the potential for higher ad pricing in terms of the ROI for your marketers hopefully being reflected in higher price per ad. And then what about the ad load? So are we kind of close to being at a full ad load? Is there a long runway there? Just trying to get a sense for pricing and volume underneath advertising. And then also along the lines of advertising, heading into the holiday season, should we expect any increase in your efforts around Alexa commercialization, voice keyword ads let's say, and does that fit into your broader advertising growth strategy? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, let me talk a little bit more broadly about advertising. So yeah, we are seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors and sellers for sure, authors, as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. As far as penetration, we don't have that quantified for you, but we still believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of and bringing to our customers new and more relevant purchase options. So we're continuing to invent both on the product side, the tools side with our goal being improve the usability of the tools for advertisers, make smarter recommendations for customers, automate activities so that advertisers don't have to work as hard, and invent new products for advertisers. If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon consumers at the same time. So I know it doesn't answer the question about specific rate increases or capacity, but that is the general strategy that we're seeing in advertising.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and this is Dave. Just jumping on the Alexa point, I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa. I think we clearly had a lot of exciting things happen in the last month or two in terms of new announcements in devices out there. And I mean really looking at that, the goal is to make customers' lives easier and make it more convenient and a lot of that is you're seeing that in the homes and to some extent on the Go. So I think if you look at the recent announcements, you're seeing a few things. I mean, one, we're bringing a lot of cool hardware options to customers. Second thing, I mean, making the Alexa service smarter. It's getting smarter and more capable. And then also delivering tools for developers, helping them build for and really with Alexa. So I think making her smarter and seeing that she gets smarter with all the skills, leveraging the cloud and AI, becoming more knowledgeable and introducing a lot of really new cool new features. So really excited about the customer response with those devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nLloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Wanted to just follow up on the advertising side and get a sense for how much you guys feel like you're demand constrained versus supply constrained, either in the ability to put more ads on your property and/or just provide the tools to advertisers and do you feel like there's more demand than you can satisfy? Any color you can share there?\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hey, this is Dave. I mean nothing specific. I mean I think so much of what we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on the site in particular and how we position those. And so we spent a lot of time looking at the data to make sure that customer behavior and feedback is telling us that it's useful and helpful and customers making those purchase decisions. And so, we're always testing different levels of that and trying to understand, and the various features, whether it's display or some of the sponsored elements that are out there, what kind of feedback is out there, but certainly keep that in mind as we roll out new things.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.\nColin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. I guess two quick ones. Any change in the trajectory of Prime membership growth since the June price increase? And then, how would you describe the pricing environments for the core AWS services? And is this still a key lever that you use for business development? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the Amazon Prime price increase. Of course, that went into effect earlier the year in May. We're very pleased with the renewal data and annual sign up data that we've seen. Since then, program remains very strong, both in membership and engagement, and a lot of our video content, music and shipping definitely as well as other Prime Benefits. We just continue to see that ramp up, not only in the U.S., but in other countries. So we do continue to make the Prime offer better as well. I mentioned earlier the linkage with Prime member savings at Whole Foods market that we set up in Q2, the expansion of grocery delivery to more than 60 cities in the U.S. using Prime Now and Whole Foods stores, the ability to pick up groceries from Whole Foods. Adding content, we have a great slate of content coming out in the fourth quarter here. Hopefully, you've seen already Jack Ryan and The Romanoffs and pretty soon you'll see the follow-up season to The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and also a couple other things, and hopefully you'll see Thursday Night Football tonight when you get home.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: This is Dave. Just on the AWS pricing philosophy. I mean, just a reminder. When we look at this, our pricing philosophy has worked relentlessly, take cost out of our own cost structure and where we can pass savings on to the web services customers in the form of lower prices. So it's easy to lower prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford the lower prices and that's something we work very hard in all our businesses, including AWS to do that. So when you look at AWS now, we've lowered prices 67 times since we launched, including a few more in the last few months. So those pre-OC price reductions are a normal part of our business for us.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: (30:42) call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-07-26 20:59:06", "content": "Executives: Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead?\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you. I guess, the standout metric of the quarter was the profitability and the margins. Both U.S. and International have improved year-over-year. Could you talk about (03:04) was it better than your expectations for the quarter? And then maybe reasons for the ad business to accelerate within the other line? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, yeah. Thanks, Justin. Yeah, for the quarter, so it was a strong quarter. We had \u2013 what I attribute it to is continued strength in our \u2013 some of our most profitable areas. AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth. Advertising also had strong growth. Elsewhere we saw probably better than expected efficiencies in operations, our infrastructure costs, and generally all of our fixed costs. You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate. So that's what I would point to. Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold. I would say that, in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in International segment than it's in North America, it's growing at a same rapid clip year-over-year. Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently. We've launched devices in multiple countries, Echo and Alexa were launched in France. Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter. So continued \u2013 it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Hey, maybe two things. Just a little bit of color on that unit growth, I think, it was 17%, any particular things to call out there as that would have stunted that growth or negatively limited? Or is that just kind of the new, new normal? And then Brian, I'm sorry, you just talked better than expected efficiencies in operations, could I ask you to tease that out a little bit more, and a little more color particularly on the retail side of the business? Are there particular newfound efficiencies that are sustainable? Thanks a lot.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let's start with unit growth. So I will note, we did a very strong unit growth rate last year in Q2, with 27%, so we're comping against that. As we look back on that, there were number of factors. I mean, in any quarter there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down to $25. So there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that we saw last year. So we're comping that. Another factor is digital content that moves to subscription. So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just \u2013 the units do not count in this unit calculation. So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth. We think it's driven by again Prime, the Prime program, the engagement of Prime customers as well as increased selection, and particularly third-party selection. On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure costs and capital costs, and the addition of fixed cost heads. So one thing that you'll notice is that, we've grown \u2013 we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed head count, excluding the acquisitions we've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June, on a trailing 12 month basis. But 23% of that was in the second half of last year. So we are continuing to look at where we're investing head count. We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by head count that's moving within the company. There's a lot of movement of tech head count. And so there was less external hiring in the first half of this year. We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies, and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people. So I think the first half of the year could be a good test of where our cost structure is, coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday. Last year, there was a lot of first half investment. If you look back on infrastructure and fixed head count that may be made that less pronounced. But this year it's a little more apparent.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask two, if I could. First, 3Q is typically a heavy fulfillment center build out period ahead of the holidays, and then lower utilization, but obviously your profit outlook is good. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about FC build out and square footage increases this year? And then, secondly a lot of excitement around the pharmacy opportunity with the acquisition of PillPack. Can you frame some of the strategic rationale there around the acquisition, and how that helps advance your efforts, and how we should think about integration going forward? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On the fulfillment center capacity, I don't have a number for you, today. I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into holiday, but if you think back, the last two years, we've added square footage that's exceeded 30% growth, both in 2016 and 2017. We anticipate it's going to be lower this year as we get some efficiencies off what we've built over the last few years, but I don't have a number for you today. I will say that, the majority of it is being put in service in the back-end of the year, just like in the last two years. But I'll \u2013 we'll clarify that next quarter. On PillPack, yes, the deal of course hasn't closed, yet. We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. But we're excited. I think the company has a really highly differentiated customer experience, and they've done a great job getting to the size and scale that they're at today. We think that, working together with them we can expand on that in the future. They're like a lot of the other acquisitions we've done. Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly-differentiated customer experience, and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. So we think PillPack has got all those traits, and we look forward to the deal closing and working with them.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. On AWS, does the backlog there give you confidence in the ability for this business to continue to post the type of robust growth that you've seen of late? And on Alexa, now that you're reaching a meaningful number of Alexa users, I wondered if you could discuss a bit more about how Alexa is impacting retail business?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with AWS. Yeah, we're very happy with the results we're seeing, and the backlog that we see, and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see. Again, the business has accelerated the last three quarters, and we're seeing great signs in a number of areas. We've added 800 new services and features so far this year; that's an accelerated pace from last year, which was a record year. We see customers have migrated more than 80,000 databases using the AWS Database Migration Service. And customers are just branching out to a lot of new products from us. There are new areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, serverless computing and database and analytics are really big. So we think that, when you look at it, why do people come to us? It's essentially set functionality and pace of innovation that we've demonstrated for multiple years. We've built a very strong partner and customer ecosystem. And frankly we've the most proven reliability of security and performance, and we've been at this longer than anyone else. So again, we continue to deliver for customers. We continue to use feedback from customers to develop new services and features. The operating margin itself will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, a very strong performance this quarter. Obviously, part of that was in the capital leases being flat year-over-year, and the team's ability to really run the data centers at a higher efficiency.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And I think, the second question was just related to how is Alexa impacting the business, overall. And \u2013 hey, this is Dave. I mean, I think, we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those. We talked to coming out of Prime Day, had some good success and happy customers enjoying some of the devices there. So I think, that's a lot of \u2013 the focus now is really having a good and exciting roadmap of recent revises and more to come ahead, and getting those into customers' hands.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Just on the AWS point, as you're seeing customers to AWS, you're adding new customers to AWS, can you give us a sense of sort of where you're seeing customers spend focus. How successful \u2013 you mentioned database, but what other areas you're potentially seeing as customers move up the stack with you and grow? And then, you flagged the flat capital lease growth on a year-over-year basis. In the past when you've talked about the growth in CapEx and capital lease, you generally referred to trying to grow those numbers or that infrastructure growth overall more or less with the business. Is there some level of efficiency breakthrough that you've gotten there where that's no longer the case? Or is it a function of timing? How should we think about what that CapEx and capital lease spend signals about your expectations for growth?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I would say it's just a demonstration of the very tight period where we \u2013 we've still added a lot, I mean, $4.6 billion is a lot of capital leases, but the rate of growth over last year is flat. So what I would say is, I'm not sure about the breakthrough element of it. We do spend a lot of time driving better efficiency in our data centers. We do see it; sometimes it is higher than other quarters. The starting point for our expectation would be, the usage growth would be very \u2013 that our growth in infrastructure costs would start with the growth in usage, which has been exceeding the revenue growth rate. But we can drive more efficiently and we can sometimes bank the efficiencies of prior investments that we've made in other periods. So it will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. I would say last year in the first half was a pretty large investment area. I'll lump it in with capital expenditures, but in the first two quarters, Q1 of last year, it was 82% growth year-over-year in capital expenditures, Q2 was 67%. This year, those numbers are 33% in Q1, and 1% in Q2. So it's a \u2013 there's a bit of timing at play here, but I think overall, in the longer-term, we certainly work to drive efficiency in both AWS infrastructure capability, and also in our warehouse networks. I don't have on the other piece, on product detail, I don't have anything more for you. I would just say that, our growth is coming from customers that span from start-ups to enterprise customers to government agencies, and they start small and then they continue to build and shift their businesses to us, and many of them have gone \u2013 a large number have gone all-in on AWS, and have had a chance to lower their cost structures as a result. I'd count Amazon in that category, because on the consumer side of the business, we increasingly see infrastructure savings due to the conversion to AWS resources.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one on the ad business, Brian, I was just wondering, could you give us some examples of some products you've had particular success with on the ad side? And I know you guys are always focused on removing customer friction points and solving pain points for customers, maybe talk to us about some of the still existing pain points for your advertiser customers you're looking to address with the advertising product? And the second one, I know it's an accounting question, but we're going to be asked it a lot. On revenue accounting, can you just sort of walk us through any of the accounting changes that any of the revenue lines had in the current quarter because of the multiple accounting moving pieces? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, let me give Dave a chance afterwards to talk about that piece, but I'll start with advertising. So conceptually stepping back, it's now a multi-billion dollar business for us. We're seeing strong adoption across a number of fronts. Amazon vendors, sellers, authors as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. So we have hundreds of thousands of emerging and established advertisers. And they're using our services to achieve their marketing goals to \u2013 whether that's to drive new brand awareness, discovery or ultimately purchase decisions on our site. Pain points and improvements, I would say, our priorities include improving the usability of our tools for advertisers, helping make smarter recommendations for customers. Automating, we're doing a lot of work on automating the activities that the advertisers need to do, and continue to invent new products for those advertisers. We also think measurement is going to be important so we're focused on our measurement capabilities, so advertisers understand what outcomes they're driving on our properties. And we think that we're uniquely positioned to show them the direct benefit of their advertising.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And Brian, this is Dave. Just on the accounting piece, specifically to Q2, the impact of the Accounting Standards Update, revenue recognition changes we did starting in the first part of year, it's a $640 million increase to other revenue, specifically related to how we treat some of the advertising service. So you remember as part of the adoption beginning in 2018, certainly the advertising services were classified as revenue rather than cost of sales. So $640 million more is in other revenue this second quarter. You'd see that in that line item, which is about $2.2 billion here in the second quarter. In addition to that, some of the other factors I talked about last quarter, some of the treatment of gross to net changes in some sales of apps and app content, digital media costs, some of that shift created a headwind for online stores revenue. So that year-over-year growth rate for that line item would have been higher, but for that change.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks so much. Two questions if I can. On Whole Foods, any update on the integration of Whole Foods within the broader Prime ecosystem, the way in which you're tying those assets and customer bases together to sort of promote the flywheel that you've talked about a fair bit? And Prime Now, any update on the scale of markets globally, and what you're learning as Prime Now continues to scale in terms of how users adopt the service, putting SKUs closer to prem what that does to the velocity of purchasing? Thank you so much.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. So, it was a big quarter for Whole Foods and Prime. We launched additional savings for Prime members at Whole Foods. If you go to Whole Foods store or Whole Foods Market 365 store, you see a lot of yellow stickers for 10% discounts of hundreds of sale items. You also see deep discounts on selected popular products. So Prime members have adopted this benefit, it's one of the fastest rates we've ever seen for a Prime benefit, and they've already saved millions of dollars on everything from seasonal favorites to as I said popular daily sales. So in addition, we've expanded grocery delivery to 20 cities so that's picking up steam. During the Prime Day, we had some unique deals for Prime customers at Whole Foods. Actually, the deals lasted for a week at Whole Foods. And people had, again the ability to see the benefit that Prime membership save incremental dollars, because of it at Whole Foods. And the Prime Rewards Visa Card, which gives you 5% off on all purchases has been applied to Whole Foods' purchases as well. So that is the second wave, probably after the first wave where we talked in previous calls about initial price drops, putting lockers in the stores, selling some of the Whole Foods' products on the Amazon site, and other things. So the invention level is still really high. We think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going, we'll see how that develops. Prime Now, I guess, my comments are that, it's in 50 cities worldwide, it's across 9 countries. It is different than \u2013 we have multiple options for you in grocery delivery. We have the delivery services \u2013 so AmazonFresh and Prime Now which serve a certain need. We have a traditional grocery store now with Whole Foods, and then we have the combination of those two with home delivery, and we're using Prime Now or Whole Foods products through Prime Now to make those deliveries as well as the new kind of stores with Amazon Go that we're experimenting with. So lots of innovation, invention on that front as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good evening. Hey guys, I had two questions. First is on the Music business. So I think, you said recently you had tens of millions of paying subscribers. So are those paying music listeners coming from Prime, and using the mobile app, or they coming in from Echo? Any color on what's driving that uptake and converting users into paid members? Then the second question is, you mentioned efficiency gains in retail and the improvement in retail operating margin. If we look at International, it's still negative, but it's also improving pretty meaningfully, so can you parse where that improvement's coming from between India and the other emerging markets versus some of the more mature markets in Western Europe?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, let me start with that second question. So, yes, we have seen over the last few quarters, improved operating margins internationally. I would say in places like Europe and Japan, we're seeing many of the efficiencies I talked about earlier on fixed head count, operations costs, infrastructure costs, and also things like marketing working to be very efficient. I would also say that, although it's smaller internationally the impact of advertising is starting to show up more and more internationally. It's growing quite quickly just as it is in North America. But you're right. We continue to invest. We're investing in India obviously, and have seen good traction there. We just passed our Fifth Year Anniversary \u2013 celebrated our Fifth Year Anniversary, as the most visited site in India. So we think there's a lot of great innovation that has continued to occur for Indian consumers and sellers, and that will continue. But you're also seeing additional expansion. So we launched Prime in Australia; we're rolling devices out. We launched Echo and Alexa in France. The Echo Spot in India and Japan, and we announced that we're going to expand Echo and Alexa soon to Italy, Mexico and Spain. So I would say that we're continuing to frontload Prime benefits in the newer geographies. So that's one of the issues that we see with operating margin. But we think it's the right thing to do. We are seeing strong traction in that front as well. We also like that the \u2013 on Prime Day, we were able to expand our list of countries that experience Prime Day; this year to Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. So we're very bullish on our International business. We do realize it's a period of investment and we're in different stages of growth in different countries.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and this is Dave. Just quickly on Music, as you mentioned, tens of millions of paid customers are enjoying Amazon Music. When you look at the Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, it continues to grow very quickly. We've got those offerings in more than 30 countries now and the catalog there's tens of millions of songs, and a lot of rich playlists, personalized stations, those kinds of things. Of course we started in Music with Prime Music, a little bit earlier in that space, and I think that's been a great way for Prime members to enjoy some of that catalog for free, and then as they enjoy that, be able to move into the Amazon Music Unlimited skill. One of the great things that's also part of that, I think, you alluded to it is just Alexa, and one of the most popular features we see as you probably imagine for using those devices are just interacting with Alexa, wherever you may be is being able to listen to music. So that's proven to be a, I think, a good skill for folks to be able to enjoy in addition to a really kind of rich and growing Amazon skill set. We now have more than 45,000 skills available to customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.\nYoussef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you very much. On the new Supreme Court decision, you guys have been collecting state taxes in all 45 states where it's applicable for a 1P. And for a 3P, I think, it was in two states. Have you seen any slowdown to growth in these two states since you began collecting taxes? I think, you started maybe last 12 months or so. When will you start collecting taxes in the rest of the country, and will you charge for it? Because my understanding is that, in those two states you do not collect or you do not charge to help these 3P sellers file taxes or collect state taxes. Thank you.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Youssef this is Dave. So right now, as you mentioned 45 states that have state-imposed sales tax, first-party products we do our own collection on that. For 3P sellers right now, it's three states. So Washington State started as of January 1, Pennsylvania as of April 1, and most recently Oklahoma on July 1. So those are the ones where we're collecting and remitting. We haven't said \u2013 and to your second point we've not talked about any kind of trends. As you could imagine some of these are still really early days.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Given the focus in the press release about Alexa Voice Services, any thoughts about how you would monetize on third-party devices? And then just a follow up on Amazon Prime Video Channels, any plans to offer standard skinny bundles to become a cable replacement? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, let me start with Alexa. So right now, our emphasis is around expanding the reach of Alexa and the usefulness. So as Dave mentioned, we're now up over 45,000 skills. We have a developer network of \u2013 that's expanded and we have over 13,000 smart home devices from 2,500 unique brands. You're seeing things like expansion into the hotel space where we're partnering with hotels to allow you to experience Alexa while you're traveling. And you saw from the quote that was in our press release from Jeff, the number of Alexa-enabled devices has tripled in the past year, so \u2013 including some really large companies like Polk, Sonos, Acer, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, BMW, Ford, Toyota to name a few. So that's the biggest emphasis, is getting the expansion of Alexa to places where it can be useful. We also are developing new machine learning tools to help developers more easily build Alexa skills. We feel like we're getting great traction there. So I think your original question was about monetization of Alexa, but right now the biggest thing we can do is to make it as useful as possible, and make devices that can use the skills.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and then just on the second question. I mean, I can't speculate on what we might do in the future, but I'd say today, with Prime Channels, I think, we're really pleased with the growth we're seeing. We've seen some good channels come online over the last few quarters, and seen some good traction there. So we'll keep focusing on building out even better selection, because it's clear to us that customers want that option to be able to add that content as part of their Prime memberships.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-04-26 20:45:59", "content": "Executives: Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Our first question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nEric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks so much for taking the question. Wanted to ask if you had any update on the state of the advertising business, sort of the state of conversations with advertisers? What product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of 2017 and into 2018 broadly for the platform? Thanks so much.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, sure, Eric. I would say advertising continues to be a bright spot both from a product standpoint and also financially. It continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the \u2013 in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item. So our philosophy there again is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers generally are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they all want to reach our customers generally to drive brand awareness, discovery and eventually purchase. Before I go into the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. The Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and One-Day options. And our Two-Day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits like Prime Video. The value of Prime to customers has never been greater. And the cost is also high, as we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119 for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16. Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price of Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And, Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, just wanted to remind folks that we mentioned this last quarter on the call. But on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies. So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas. As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of costs of sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is \u2013 the other revenue is, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure. So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex-FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter. Again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is \u2013 would be included in the North America segment. As you look at the other supplemental line item, just a few items of note. The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex-FX. Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard. And then the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex-FX year-over-year. Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period. Prior to 2018, we recognized this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year. So in Q1 of this year, subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one on Prime, let me ask you this. As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S. are not signing on for Prime at this point? And the second one on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now and Whole Foods, recognizing it's only in a few cities, what can you share about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly to roll that out to more cities in the U.S. and hopefully, New York soon?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. There's discounted student plans. There's also discounts for other groups. So, we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day. The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So, the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime \u2013 those markets using Prime Now. So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense, the accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S. business in Q1, how much of that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? Are there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving that? And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer, you specifically call out sort of customer additions in some of your comments, what customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. So first, with the \u2013 you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure. But the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime flywheel. So we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime benefits, especially digital benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things. We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So, not much more I can add by product line to North America. And I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're \u2013 we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last two quarters. The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate. So what we're saying is just continued strong usage both by existing customers and signing new customers for \u2013 see increased pace of enterprise migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly trying new services. We are seeing people move more and more of their workflows to AWS and at a faster pace. And customers are moving databases to AWS as Aurora continues to grow at a very rapid clip. So stepping back, I would say, what is driving the growth, we believe, again, it's the value that we create for AWS customers. We have the functionality and pace of innovation that others don't. We have partner and ecosystem that others don't. And we have proven operational capability and security expertise that's highly valued to the AWS customer base.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMark A. May - Citi Investment Research: Thank you. Some of the data that we've seen suggests that this year, the rate of growth in the build out of fulfillment centers and other parts of the retail logistics network as well as data centers, but more on the former, that rate of growth is slowing this year relative to last year and even the year before. I know that you guys go through periods of kind of heavy investment, then you grow into that capacity. But I just wonder if you could comment a little bit about where we are kind of in that ebb and flow of that cycle right now. And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue? Thanks.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, Mark, this is Dave. On that second question, we've not commented on the growth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say there. As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised \u2013 or other revenue rather that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%. But again, that's not in relation to the COGS portion.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And on the question on capacity, \u2013 excuse me, cap \u2013 I'll address it as CapEx and capital leases, we're still seeing strong investment there. If I look at the quarterly trends, you're right, that this quarter was up 33% in isolation versus last year. I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year. So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment in warehouses. So if I step back on the trailing 12 months though, CapEx, which is predominantly tied to our fulfillment center network, is up 47%. That is above the Amazon fulfilled unit growth rate, but we combined the strength of the FBA program and the space requirements as we get into bigger and bigger products. That's a representative number for that period. On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the AWS business, that's up 49% year-over-year on the trailing 12 months. So again, usage rates continue to exceed the revenue growth rates. Usage rates are strong, but we also have a number of projects underway that seek to increase our efficiency of our data centers. So have a couple things at play there that hopefully keep that number closer to the revenue growth rate.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDouglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you had significant operating income upside in 1Q and I think a better outlook for the second quarter than many expected. Can you just talk about the biggest factors that drove the delta relative to your 1Q guide? And is there any reason to think that you couldn't see similar leverage in the back half of the year? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes, we came in well above our range that we had given of $300 million to $1 billion. I would attribute it primarily to a few things. First, the top-line growth was \u2013 continued to be strong coming out of Q4. We had great consumer business strength. We also had strong AWS revenue strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, which is a different trend that we've seen recently. So customer adoption in AWS remained strong. And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on \u2013 with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers and quite frankly, people. So we saw great efficiencies at the higher level of revenue, and we're able to handle it. So that was generally very good financially. We \u2013 at the time of guidance, we were concerned a bit about the high \u2013 relatively high inventory we had at year-end in space utilization. So we're still very full in our fulfillment centers. But we were able to correct that due to the high sales without having additional handling and transportation cost that you would normally see the reconfigure inventory locations. So that also helped and probably differential versus the guidance estimate. And then, lastly, I would say, advertising continues to be a strong contributor to profitability and had strong results this quarter. As far as what that portends for future quarters, for now, I want to focus on Q2 and it's incorporated into our Q2 guidance. So we expect a lot of the strength areas to continue, consumer demand, AWS and advertising. We will definitely see higher investments as we move through the year. For example, video content spend will increase year-over-year, and we'll continue to hire, in particular, software engineers. We'll have some costs in Q2 ahead of what's anticipated to be a Prime Day in early Q3. So \u2013 and then as you know, Q3 is generally a lower quarter due to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building teams. So, I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with the customer reception we had in Q1 and then the income that, that drove.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. Two questions. The $239 million in other income, what was that? And then could you just wax a little bit eloquently hopefully, on advertising revenue? And like how do you balance what are \u2013 what should be a monstrous amount of ad revenue opportunities, especially high profit, high margin ad revenue opportunities against an ideal or optimal consumer experience? These sponsored units I see in every search I do on Amazon seems great from an advertising perspective, but I sometimes wonder if it doesn't dilute the consumer experience. So just talk about how you balance that. And then finally, as part of advertising, you've got also a heck of a lot inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you don't allow \u2013 that you don't directly charge for, how do you think about that as an advertising revenue opportunity? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me wax eloquently. Try to anyway. So let's start with the $239 million; that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we partnered with. We have transportation companies that we partnered with and other technology companies. As the stock market increased in Q1, a lot of these companies also went up. So that's where we book the gain on warrants that we have with \u2013 on investments. It's also \u2013 there was a good bit of FX gain due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar. That showed up on a lot of lines on the P&L, but that one was positive. On advertising, so let's step back a bit. It's now a multibillion-dollar program and growing very quickly. Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products. So we show the sponsored products, we're trying to show people things they had maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their normal search results. So we're looking for a good balance here, as we said. We want customers to get the benefit of the new brand and product discovery, and then we want to let sellers for both emerging and established brands, reach those customers. Those advertisers are of all shapes and sizes with the main goal of, again, trying to reach our customers whether it's to drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully purchase. So, we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always balancing helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it disruptive. But you're right, there are always pressures in that. We will come down on the side of the customer. On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose not to do that right now.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add to on that just related to Prime Video, as you may have seen in the announcement earlier today about the renewed agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Night Football. So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL. We've done some things like the Prime Original Series All or Nothing; the third season's coming up soon, focused on the Dallas Cowboys. So that was one of our first forays in the live format that \u2013 one of the first forays in the live format where we had live ads and kind of, we're not only learning the technology, but learning to \u2013 learning that business. And I think we've been pleased with what we've seen so far obviously and look forward to the next few seasons with the NFL.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. So I think, Brian, I had a question on your international shopping rollout, so I think this was recently announced. Where do you think you measure up versus some of the more local players where you might not have a direct presence in the country? And where do you think your value proposition lies? And presumably this is informed by users coming in from those regions where you don't really have an official site for people come in to buy stuff from you anyway. So, which regions or countries are accounting for most of the demand that you are seeing? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Stephen, are you're still on? Can you elaborate more on the countries you're talking about, specifically?\nStephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: No, I'm just wondering, you already have a direct presence in some of the countries like China, Japan, et cetera, and the international shopping rollout presumably expands all that selection to most of the globe. So just wondering if you are seeing incremental demand, and where you might be seeing demand coming in from countries where you might not have a direct presence?\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Oh, on global store? Okay. Yes.\nStephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Sorry, I thought you meant some of our expansion countries. So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in \u2013 who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country. So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Yeah, thank you. I'd like to maybe dive into a couple of local recent overhangs. First, on shipping partners, just wondering how dependent are you on any shipping partner? And can you talk about any initiatives you've had to build out your own shipping network? I know in some countries that you might be over 50% of the stuff you're delivering. Could talk a little bit about dependency there? And then secondly, on taxes, can you remind us what happened when Amazon started collecting taxes on your own items in various states? And just kind of overview of your view on collecting third-party sales \u2013 taxes from third parties in other states if that were to pass? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with transportation. We have a great group of carriers that we use globally and you know who they are. But we're also growing our teams and capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume on our own, particularly around the holiday season. So that's driven a lot of our expansion of Amazon Logistics. It's driven the creation of sort centers. It's driven the purchase of airplanes to move product between points within our delivery network. So we will continue to operate with this combination of external partners and internal capability. We like what we see so far with our Amazon Logistics capability. It's well over 50% in some countries, particularly the UK. It helps with again Prime Now and AmazonFresh and a lot of initiatives that we'll see, which again we mentioned the Prime Now is tied in with Whole Foods, now in 10 cities. So we think it's a core competency that we have and we need to have, and we'll continue to invest in that.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and Justin, this is Dave, just on the sales tax piece. Today, on the first-party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a state-imposed sales tax. On the 3T piece, we do collect on behalf of our sellers in two states, Washington State as of the first of this year, and then Pennsylvania turned on here on April 1. So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party piece that's been coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years. So yeah, nothing really more to add on that. I think I would say we do continue to believe that the sales tax issue needs to be resolved at the federal level, and we're actively working with the states, with retailers and Congress to get federal legislation passed. We're not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitution and permissible system that is both simple and applied evenhandedly.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nGregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC: Hi. Thanks. So I want to follow up on Prime a little bit. The fee increase, why now? I mean, we've been adding value for a long time, obviously shipping costs are going up. Why is now the right time to have that fee hike, especially since membership looks like the growth numbers are starting to slow? And tied into that, there's a lot of Alexa mentioning in the release. Could you give us some uptake on the importance of Alexa and basically voice commerce, and so the metrics you get in terms of usage there and the flywheel? Thanks.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. We always evaluate the price of Prime in all the countries we're in, and we're looking for creative ways to reach the customer. As I mentioned earlier, creation \u2013 or excuse me, monthly plans, student plans, et cetera. So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefits it's delivering. I mentioned that four years ago when we last increased the price of Prime, you could get 20 million products within two days. Today you could get over 100 million products within two days, and many, many, many products within one day, same day or two hours. So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program. It's much different than it was in 2014. This is a reflection of that, that's a better reflection of the cost value of the program.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from...\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sorry go ahead.\nOperator: Sorry go ahead. Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. So the U.S. international revenue mix, ex-Whole Foods and ex-AWS looks about 64%, 36%. Given investments in the international markets would you envision international kind of closing the gap in the coming years? And what would be the key drivers of the mix shift getting closer to 50-50? Thank you.\nBrian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yeah I don't want to project relative proportions of the different segments, but what I can say is the international continues to see the same level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North America. So when we add benefits, Prime benefits, we're probably adding them at an earlier stage of life in the Prime program internationally than we did in the U.S. So, they have different dynamics. We think at the end of the day customers behave the same globally and that they value low prices selection and great customer experience. So, we'll continue to make these investments in Prime. We'll continue to expand selection, continue to build FBA programs so that it increases selection even more and builds great partnerships with sellers. We'll continue to accelerate shipping. We'll continue to lower prices. And sorry, I cut out the last person [Technical Difficulty] (30:50-30:55) including Alexa, which we think has great stickiness with, in the home and I think creates a lot of value in the home and also allows you to access over time Amazon products better. We'll continue to invest in India where we're seeing great progress with both sellers and also customers. And we like the momentum we've seen there. The Prime program started in the first year in India grew faster than any Prime program we've seen in other countries. We're adding local content in India, video content, excuse me. We're also adding other benefits, Prime benefits. We're rolling out devices there, and we're seeing Indian developers developing skills for Alexa, and Alexa is up, as you saw in the press release, to 40,000 [Technical Difficulty] (31:46-31:51). Yes, but it's \u2013 it is important to us that they all are still delighting customers and growing to the best of their ability.\nDave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thanks Brian. And thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}], "2020": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-01-30 21:01:20", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.\nShelly Kay Pfeiffer: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, January 30, 2020 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: At this time, we will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thanks. Really appreciate this. Just on the AWS business, as you look sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter particularly represented by the amount of dollars added quarter-over-quarter, is there anything in particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of workloads, regions, specific customer types, that you felt like drove the strength particularly relative to the directional -- direction of growth that we were seeing in the earlier parts of the year?\nBrian Olsavsky: Hi Heath. No, I would not isolate it to any one set of customers or products. I think it's been pretty broad-based, and it's kind of the culmination of a lot of work on adding new products and features, adding to our sales and marketing teams, and having better penetration in enterprise customers and hitting a lot of very different industries. So, I think that's what you're seeing. We feel that our product set is -- leads the market, and we add to it at a quicker pace than our competition, so actually the gap on capacity and features is growing as we speak. We also think that there's a real network effect when you use AWS with the millions of active customers and tens of thousands of global partners. And we continue to expand. We're now in 69 availability zones across 22 geographic regions. So, I think it's the combination of increased sales support, more and better products that hit customers' needs, and also the geographic expansion is what you're seeing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thank you. Was just hoping you guys could disaggregate a bit the strength in seller services, how much of that was third-party marketplace commission specifically? And are you seeing more of an uptick in some of the other content and services? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: On seller services, I would say it was just a very strong quarter if that's what you're referring to 31% growth in revenue. It was strong on a unit basis. And as you said, there's probably additional strength in FBA which has higher fee set than MFN does. So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year. That was particularly strong in Q4, and I think you'll see that more as we move into 2020.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJustin Post: Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could go high level, what drove upside to your guidance on revenue in the quarter on the retail side? Anything there that you'd really call out? And then on the AWS investments, obviously you just talked about investments starting in 3Q. Where are you in that investment? Your margins are still below peak. Where are you kind of in that investment cycle? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Well, as I said, on revenue we came in at $87.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion. $400 million of -- roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange, but what we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of November on. We also had a very big uptick in response to the one-day availability that's been building through the year. I think Prime has been very strong. We mentioned that we have more than 150 million paid Prime members globally now. And we mentioned that more people joined Prime in Q4 than any other quarter before. So, a lot of good momentum there built up on the aggregation of benefits that we continue to add to the Prime program most recently the one-day -- expansion of one-day shipping. On AWS, where are we in the cycle? I talked more in 2018 when the margins in AWS were closer to 30% about the efficiency of infrastructure spend and -- versus prior years. So, we continue to -- since that point, we've continued to add infrastructure capability and -- to support our global expansion as well. But what you're seeing probably more in the margins is the expansion of our sales and marketing effort at some of those costs as well as price decreases and longer-term contracts that we've signed with some of our customers. You notice on our balance sheet that our future commitments on the multiyear deals now stands at $30 billion at year-end, and that's up 54% year-over-year. So, there's a lot of good momentum on the enterprise side as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Just to ask about AWS again. I mean, the investors have become, I guess, recently concerned just about again the slowing AWS revenue and margin and whether it's a function of increased competition. So, maybe just talk about how you're reacting. You did talk about spending on sales and price cuts, but just any more you can talk about the competitive environment? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. I would probably argue a bit with the growth comments. As we see it here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019. So, we continue to be happy with our top line growth. The -- in dollar terms as opposed to percentages, we had a larger dollar increase in revenue both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So, we're very happy with the progress of the revenue and our adoption and acceptance by customers. As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment not only in capacity, but also in services and features that we provide to customers. We've learned from customers. We just had a great re:Invent conference in December where all of our -- it was a great aggregation of partners and customers and developers. And at those events, we not only get to present our new products and there were over 100 that were launched in December, but we also get to hear customer issues and help -- that helps to sign or educate our forward road map. So, it's a great shared learning. I think customers react to it. Customers will be at different stages of their adoption curve. There's always different phases: first, moving to the cloud, then organizing on the cloud, and then growing further. So there's a lot of movement. I said that repeatedly I think in the setting that any -- quarter quarter-to-quarter movement is going to be a little bumpy. But generally, what you're seeing is the convergence of a lot of investment, a lot of operational efficiency, and a lot of innovation on behalf of customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nStephen Ju: Okay. So thank you. I wanted to switch it up a little bit. I guess you guys called this out in your press release, but I'm wondering if you could talk about your efforts to get the SMBs and the micro SMBs online in India. What exactly is involved from a practical perspective? Do you need to have door-to-door sales folks? And what can do to reduce friction between logistics payments and some of the other factors there? And second, what are these SMBs selling? Is it like long-tail inventory? Is it merchandise that you can get to exports to global buyer base? And do you think this could be content that could be exclusive to Amazon? Thank you.\nDave Fildes: Yes Stephen, this is Dave. Thanks for the question. As you said, I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen. We are continuing to invest meaningfully in digitizing those say MSMBs micro-small and medium-sized businesses. We did pledge to invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro and small businesses across India. And we've got a goal of bringing more than 10 million online by 2025. So, this $1 billion investment will help to enable $10 billion in cumulative Indian exports by 2025. A lot of different facets to those types of investments, won't go into too much for specifics, but a lot of work being done there. We're also focused on job growth, job creation over there. Since we launched over in India in 2013, we've created over 700,000 direct and indirect jobs. So -- we also recently announced plans to create additional one million jobs in India by 2025. So, a lot of -- I think innovation, ideas, investment. That team over there continues to do a great job locally of taking a lot of the tenants that we've had at Amazon around innovation building and really run with that over there and done a great job of coming up with some interesting and new services and features that I think are specific to that region. And hopefully, as we continue to do that, we'll keep identifying areas over in India and tool sets features over in India that we can bring back to other regions to help benefit other sellers and the other websites more broadly.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just, the first one Brian, I think on one of the media interviews, you talked about how you're becoming more efficient with one-day and you continue -- with next-day delivery and continue to do so and talked about $1 billion of cost in that current quarter. Maybe just sort of talk to us about some of the largest qualitative fix in variable costs sort of still associated with one-day and the processes and the opportunities for efficiency to really get that number down as we go throughout 2020. And then, maybe any specific product categories or good categories where you've seen an acceleration in demand from one day that you\u2019d call out?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me make sure the numbers are understood. We had talked about last year about an initial step up in cost of close to $800 million in the second quarter. We -- that carried into Q3-- was slightly higher in Q3. And then in Q4, last time on this call I mentioned that we estimated Q4 would be $1.5 billion penalty. It was slightly under that despite the higher volumes and revenue growth than was in our guidance. And looking ahead to Q1, we estimate approximately $1 billion of additional costs year-over-year. And again, in Q2, we'll start to lap this. And that doesn't mean the delta goes to zero. It means that there'll be a step up as we grow and expand on a volume basis and then we'll see where our rates are on actually delivering and fulfilling one day. So, I will keep you posted on our results and guide in the future as to where we see those costs going. If you look at the efficiency or the -- first the cost, they generally fall into a few buckets. It's obviously transportation where you're building out new transportation modes, you're adding new deliveries. Partners are adding new routes. Many times they start with subscale volumes and you build them out, you get more efficient, you get more volume, more package density and that creates efficiency. When we started this, again, Q2 of last year, we also had abrupt change to our fulfillment network in that, when it's tuned for two-day delivery on the most part when you move to one-day in a lot of cases, it's advantageous from a cost and transportation standpoint to have that inventory closer to the customer. So, we've -- last year we're in the middle of that transition. We still are as we shift inventory to be more local, it will enable local deliveries to hit shorter cutoff times. So, that will continue to become more efficient. We do see -- we will have to scale our fulfillment center network further. We grew the square footage for fulfillment and transportation by 15% each of the last two years. And we'll look ahead and see a step-up in that this year as we start to build more capacity for the one-day. I haven't guided beyond Q1, but that's certainly something that will step up. But we get efficiencies as we learn and grow and handle more one-day volume. Third area is foregone ship revenue just simply, because we're having free shipment and not charging for it. That unfortunately doesn't leverage, but it -- we do start to lap after a while. So, I would say that just as we've had other shocks to our warehouse system over the years from going to -- from media to almost every product you can imagine, to having a cycle of increased third-party presence in the FBA program now to one-day, we have a history here where we can look for opportunities to be more efficient and lower the -- any cost penalties as we move forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nDan Salmon: Thanks for taking the question guys. Brain, just to follow-up on one-day shipping. You noted that you begin to lap the beginning of the initiative here in the second quarter and that naturally costs can flow up with volumes. But just to be clear with you is the idea here is we anniversary at that sort of incremental expansion of one-day shipping either regionally or certain SKUs is functionally finished. I just want to make sure I understand that properly. And then just -- we can see the other number reported. Just any color within there on the advertising business. And in particular would love to hear an update just a bit on some of your brand initiatives there. I know that probably wasn't the focus in the holiday season, but it seems to be an important growing part. Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start on the one-day. So, yeah, we do see expansion of the one-day program as we move through the year. We've been expanding since we started this effort in Q2 of last year. Expansion means additional cities, additional routes, additional zip codes. But more -- I think what you'll see more in 2020 is also an -- more effort internationally, more costs internationally. We have greatly improved our selection of one-day in -- particularly in Europe and Japan. We started with higher one-day percentage of our shipments in those geographies, but we do have to take steps and are taking steps to increase that. And we expect that to be -- it started to be a little more balanced cost globally as we move into 2020.\nDave Fildes: Yeah, Dan. In terms of your question around brands. We're focused on the certainly brands as an advertising customer set and a lot of focus on providing the products and tools that are going to help customers and really inspire them. So, things that we're really excited about stores, so a brand can customize and curate a multipage store. It allows them to better tell customers who they are share their story. So, we can help deepen the brand engagement and the customer loyalty through that type of option. Some other things like posts, which helps customers discover products and brands. And it's through a curated feed that features the brand's lifestyle content and it's on a mobile detail page. And there's international expansion in some other areas. I think broadly with advertising, so much of this is about having -- developing great relationships with these advertisers, because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes. We're uniquely positioned to do this given our retail business. On the advertising business, or rather I should say other revenue that line item grew about 41% year-over-year. Advertising is the biggest piece of that. Line item is growing at about the same rate. Advertising revenue is as a subset been growing at about the same rate year-over-year in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two part question on AWS if I can. You called out the depreciation change with respect to AWS going forward. Just wanted to better understand some of the decisions that were made on useful life that drove that decision and how to think about that from a modeling perspective going forward? And then the second part would be what does that mean in terms of the way you're thinking about forward CapEx cycles for the AWS business, if you're assuming useful life is moving out maybe than prior assumptions? Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for bringing that up. So, we as a practice monitor and review, the useful life of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations. In Q4 -- and we've been looking at it in both the FCs, fulfillment centers and also AWS annually. As we looked in Q4 of 2019, we believe it's -- there's enough trend now to show that the useful life is exceeding four years. We have been -- for our servers and we had been depreciating them over three years. So, we are going to start depreciating them on a four year basis. It doesn't unwind any depreciation that's already been booked. It just takes the asset from its current status and extends the depreciation period and then new assets will be put into play will extend out for four years instead of three and we'll continue to revisit this. I do want to point out it's not just an accounting-related change. It's rather a reflection of the work that we've done to make our server capacity last longer. We've been operating at scale for over 13 years in this business and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. It then lowers stress and extends the useful life both through servers that we used in the AWS business and also the servers that we use to support our own Amazon businesses. So -- and despite that we give AWS customers and actually because of this, AWS customers continue to get access to the latest technologies more quickly than ever before. So, we are essentially reflecting the fact that we have gotten better at extending the useful life here and now building that into our financials moving forward. Yes, you're right. It should also impact our need and our timing of capital. I would say that it's also been part of the reason that we've been able to keep capital relatively under in check the last two years in the infrastructure area. But its $800 -- excuse me $800 million lower depreciation expense in the quarter and it will be consistent. It will change quarter-to-quarter. We will update you. But as you can see in our financial statements, it's about $2.3 billion impact in Q2 2020.\nDave Fildes: Yes. This is Dave. Just kind of on the modeling point too on that the $800 million is in Q1. We do think that the -- for that accounting impact effectively, we expect that that amount will decrease as we go through the year. And it's tech infrastructure assets. So, it's -- I should say the servers are tech infrastructure assets. So, when you think about segments the majority of these relate to the AWS segment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I just want to ask a little bit more about the holiday season, given the beat on the top line and see if there's any way to quantify maybe the impact from the shortened holiday shopping season. I mean, it doesn't seem like much just given the better results and in online sales and retail third-party seller services. But is there any way to think about the six less days? And then also you mentioned last quarter, an impact from the Japanese consumption tax. Any sort of impact? Did that go according to plan or any thoughts there would be helpful? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. First of all on the -- there were two items we discussed last quarter with the Japan consumption tax raising from 8% to 10% effective October 1. The net result was a pull forward of some purchases by Japanese customers into Q3 and also some negative elasticity effects post October 1. The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday which has a very large swing factor on international revenues is, it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018. So, it was a help to Q3 and a penalty to Q4. Those two items impacted the Q4 growth rate negatively by about 300 basis points. That was our estimate and we believe that was the actual outcome.\nDave Fildes: On the international?\nBrian Olsavsky: On the international segment excuse me yes. The -- sorry the first question was for the holiday season. Yes, we don't see that as a factor actually. And I mentioned that last call as it wasn't incorporated into our guidance in a negative fashion. The way we look at it and the way we believe it works at least in our business is that customers will have a holiday budget and they will spend it between generally the middle of November. It's creeping up to the early part of November through the holiday season. And we do see obviously spikes in Black Friday and Cyber Monday and we also see relative tick-up in trends as we get closer to the holiday and for the shipping threshold cutoff. So, there's a polarization of tends to be a polarization to early shipping -- or excuse me early purchase and late purchases. As far as, the six days that sort of time period between Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday, we don't see an impact on that. Perhaps it's a bigger issue for stores and foot traffic, but we don't notice it in our business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I just want to shift gears to grocery. I know you added Amazon Fresh into Prime kind of removing the previous $14.99 a month component there and putting it into Prime and you talked about the 2,000 U.S. cities and towns with two-hour delivery. Can you just talk about what the early impact there is of bundling kind of Fresh into Prime at this point? And then just how you're thinking about your grocery strategy as you're positioned now? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for your question. So, early results are good. We -- our grocery delivery orders from the combination of Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market more than doubled in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So, we believe customers are starting to notice and take advantage of this. We wanted to take -- we will see where people's tastes and preferences will take them. We are -- whether they go to the store, the Whole Foods Market store, whether they use Prime Now or Amazon delivery for their groceries. Right now, we're really just testing and reacting to the customer demand and the customers' preferences and we'll do so for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks for including me. Then I'll throw off three quick ones. Just talk a little bit more about gross margins in the quarter. You had -- the year-over-year trend was negative last quarter, but it turned reverse and was up this quarter. So, if there are any unusual factors you'd want to call out there. Second the -- I don't want to read over a lot into your guidance, but every year for the last five years you've always guided to operating profit down sequentially and then you may be delivered better than that, but you always guided down. This year your high end of your range is actually above what you obviously did in the fourth quarter. Are you just trying to remind people, tell people, educate people on how the mix shift in the business towards AWS and advertising is just changing the profit profile of the business? So, any more color there? And then last one since Sunday is coming up. I know you talked about the AWS customers and you mentioned the Seattle Seahawks, but what about the 49ers? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Good luck 49ers. I'll get that out there first. Good luck Ken Sachse fan. We're indifferent. Let me start with your second one on -- sorry, the -- start with gross margin.\nDave Fildes: Yes. So, I don't think there's anything too surprising caught there. I think we continue to see some good growth in the third-party business. You saw that accelerate some. We're continuing to see that trend of more FBA sellers signing and taking a larger percentage of the total 3P mix of units that are sold through, so that continues to do well. And as Brian mentioned earlier, we think some of that has to do with the program keeps getting better with faster shipping and whatnot. We've invested many billions of dollars in that program to make it even better for sellers. AWS had a strong quarter of course so that helps on the gross margin side as well. And then on transportation I think you saw the outbound shipping costs to grow around 43% year-over-year. So, certainly up a good deal versus the trend line we saw in 2018. But of course that's reflective of one-day and overall relative to our expectations. As Brian said with the $1.5 billion we guided to it came in a bit under that. So some of that was certainly part of some better-than-expected trends efficiencies. \nBrian Olsavsky: And on the comment on seasonality of guidance and Q1 that -- I think the historic trend of peaking a bit in operating income in Q4 and then stepping down in Q1 has been broken up a little bit as we've had the balance of AWS and some other things. But if you actually look back to Q1 of last year, it was the highest operating income quarter on record. And that's one of the -- makes a difficult comp this year, because we had the -- if you remember the slowdown in expenditures in 2018 in things like fixed -- adding of headcount, warehouse space, infrastructure costs, not to zero, but like down off of prior investment levels in 2016 and 2017. A lot of that continued -- that cost baseline continued into Q1 of 2019 and it actually was a super-efficient quarter from a cost and profit standpoint. Q2 of last year, we started to again make larger investments, particularly in one day. And so that's now something that is lapping in Q1 of this year because we didn't really have one-day in Q1 of last year. But -- so I think there's -- it's hard to draw those parallels between quarters anymore. I will though mention the guidance that we do have the $800 million of lower depreciation from our extension of our server useful lives, which is part of the range that we gave you of $3 billion to $4.2 billion.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-10-24 23:01:32", "content": "Company Representatives: Brian Olsavsky - Chief Financial Officer  Dave Fildes - Director of Investor Relations Shelly Kay Pfeiffer - Director of Investor Relations \nOperator: Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com, Q3 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.\nShelly Kay Pfeiffer: Hello, and welcome to our Q3, 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.  As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, October 24, 2019 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to know if I could go a little bit deeper in the framework you gave around revenue guidance for Q4.  Historically, you have seen deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate in Q4 versus Q3, but many of your businesses look like they reaccelerated in Q3 over Q2. So just wanted to know whether it was AWS or advertising or some of the things in e-commerce business, whether there are things we should be keeping in front of mind from a headwind or a tailwind perspective, as we think through some of the moving pieces in Q4? Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Hi, Eric. Yes, let me make clear, we are really excited and looking forward to a great holiday season. We feel like we had a great Q3 as well and have made rapid progress on our One Day shipping. The ops team has done a great job getting us to a position where we are in and I think that\u2019s going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4.  On the guidance front, here\u2019s what I would have you keep in mind. If you look back over the last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole Foods and Soup, which obscured this a bit in the last couple of years.  There has been a noticeable drop in run rate, between Q3 and Q4 generally on the lines of about 300 basis points. We are factoring that in this year, that\u2019s just something we\u2019re expecting. It\u2019s a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth and holiday season, that\u2019s very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year.  So we factor that in, and then there\u2019s also two other issues. The Diwali holiday in India was all in Q4 last year and a bit of it was in Q3 this year. Also the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1, and what we saw was a pre-buy a bit in Q3 at the end of the quarter, and based on our history with the last time the consumption tax went up many years ago, we\u2019ve expected a slight negative impact from that tax in Q4 in Japan.  So if you wrap those together, we expect it\u2019s going to be more of an issue with our international growth rate. I would say it has helped us by 150 basis points in Q3, and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4.  For the company, it\u2019s not as large an issue. There is about 40 basis points of favorability in Q3 and it\u2019s expected to be about 80 basis point headwind in Q4. So that\u2019s a little bit more on our guidance, but again we are really looking forward to Q4.  I think we\u2019re well positioned to make it the best holiday ever for our customers. I think One Day should help with holiday shipping. We\u2019ve got a great new device lineup you may have seen announced in September and on the AWS side, we\u2019re looking forward to our re:Invent Conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I just wanted to ask you kind of more broadly about Prime One Day, what your biggest learnings have been so far over the past several months as you\u2019ve been increasing availability?  And then how should we think about that availability now, and when we get into the heart of the holiday season? And can you also just help us understand how that\u2019s playing into your operating income guidance for 4Q? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the second part of that. So back in Q2, I said that we were estimating an $800 million expense tied to One Day in Q2, and we actually were just above that in Q2. In Q3, we expected that to grow, we put into our guidance and we hit essentially where we expected on the guidance.  So as we head into Q4, we\u2019ve added what\u2019s just nearly a $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which is essentially transportation costs, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional poles and shifts in our warehouses, the cost for deploying inventory closer to customers, there\u2019s a lot of tangential costs, by and a way the biggest expenses is on the actual transportation cost.  So we\u2019ve built that into our Q4 guidance estimate, but we\u2019re very pleased with the customer response to One Day. You can see it in our revenue acceleration and also in our unit growth acceleration. Once again the ops team has really done yeoman\u2019s work here to create this capacity for us and they continue to unlock additional capacity daily.  We\u2019re expecting that it will be again a great help to customers in Q4. We have seen Prime members increase their orders, spend more, so that they must also see it as a real help to them in their daily lives.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.\nYoussef Squali: Great, thank you so much. Brian, kind of just a couple of quick ones. Of the 400 basis point sequential acceleration growth, can you help us just understand maybe how much of that was driven by Prime Day, which I think you guys said was a record day for you versus One Day shipping. Just trying to extract one versus the other, because obviously going into Q4 you\u2019re only going to have the latter.  And then on \u2013 a lot of news around counterfeit and whatnot on the side. Can you just help quantify that for us if there is a way for you to do that? And is the higher OpEx 4Q also driven at least in part by the higher investment to combat that? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. So on the second one, I would say we\u2019re certainly very diligent on trying to catch counterfeit products. We put a lot of effort into that, we put a lot of human effort, we put a lot of machine learning and algorithmic effort into that as well.  But I would say the bigger investments in Q4 are certainly two-fold: One around the One Day shipping that I just mentioned. The other would be on AWS. We continue to invest in AWS. If you look at the progression of our operating margin in that business, it reached a high of 31% last Q4, excuse me Q3. That was a time when we were \u2013 as we mentioned at the time it was very efficient, we had been banking some savings from forward investments in infrastructure in 2017.  We continue to feel really good about not only the top line, but also the bottom line in that business, but we are investing a lot more this year in sales force and marketing personnel, mainly to handle a you know wider group of customers, an increasingly wide group of products, we continue to add thousands of new products and features a year, and we continue to expand geographically.  So the biggest impact that we saw in Q3 year-over-year in the AWS segment was tied to costs related to sales and marketing year-over-year and also to a secondary extent, infrastructure, which if you look at our capital leases or equipment leases line, it grew 30% on a trailing 12-month basis in Q3 of this year and that was 9% last year.  So there has been a step up in infrastructure costs to support the higher usage demand. So we see those trends continuing into Q4, and that\u2019s essentially, probably the other element of operating income year-over-year, that\u2019s shorter than in prior quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just to go back to the One Day costs, I appreciate the color. I\u2019m curious to hear about how you think about what portion of these costs are sort of transitory versus structurally? It sounds like there are some shipping costs in there.  Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps, you have to take over the next one to two years to get the One Day shipping costs closer to what they used to be for Two Day, and how do you think about how long it\u2019s going to take?  And then secondly on One Day, I think it\u2019s mostly U.S. to-date, is that right? And then if not, how do you think about sort of timing on pushing more internationally? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Yes, most of the expense has been in the U.S., but we have also increased our One Day selection internationally. We\u2019re starting to see some benefits from that. But I would say the biggest impact so far, both on the top line lift and also the bottom line cost is in the U.S.  You know we\u2019re still learning here on the One Day costs as we go about what the long-term cost structure will be. We know we have temporary costs in the short run as we do things like forward deploy inventory, get greater inbound into those warehouses, set up new Amazon Logistics, AMZL capacity, staff you know multiple shifts, so that we can have later pull times to hit One Day cut-offs, things like that, adding sort centers.  So it\u2019s a you know drastic change to the whole network topology that would \u2013 you know we\u2019re glad to do and working through it and we\u2019ve been down this road before obviously, and a number of different incarnations in Amazon history. So we will keep posted on a, you know quarterly basis as best we can, but right now, really forward guiding is for Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. I know most of the focus on One Day has been on speed, but based on the vans we\u2019re all seeing, it would seem that the shift to more of your own last mile infrastructure is maybe the bigger part of this.  As it scales and you get to higher levels of efficiency and utilization, does that become margin accretive or profitability accretive relative to using the third parties almost exclusively in the way that you have in the past? And then this was also a very big hiring quarter for you, 100,000 people. Can you give us a sense of where those people are going you know relative to AWS fulfillment, retail, kind of understanding sort of where they have been prioritized?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Thank you for your questions Heath. On the first question, I think it boils down to whether it will be competitive long term with other options out there. Yes, we will be, we believe that. In many cases we are already are and the places where we have very high AMZL percentages, the U.K. for instance, in some cases we\u2019re lacking alternative options for the type of delivery that we\u2019re doing. But in the long run we\u2019re going to have a combination both of our own capacity, certainly fueled by helps with third party carriers, large carriers that we\u2019ve used in the past. So we see a role for all carriers, in fact including the delivery service partner program that we\u2019ve developed to help spur small businesses to help fill this need as well.  But on the cost side, yes it\u2019s going to be the route density and other things will improve over time and get our cost structure down, but for now, there is certainly some start-up paying in adding new capacity.  On the headcount question, yes we increased as you said close to 100,000 people in Q3. I mean we are up 22% year-over-year. In the past that pointed to investments in technology teams and that\u2019s certainly part of it, but by in a way the biggest driver this time is the people that we\u2019re adding for fulfillment and transportation roles, especially as we head into Q4 and add this additional transportation capacity to service One Day.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nStephen Ju: Okay, thank you. So Brian, I\u2019m wondering if you can weigh in on the puts and takes on the long-term potential margin for AWS? When this was first launched it pretty much sold itself and now you are employing a greater number of salespeople, and with that I guess the incremental marketing dollars. But on the other hand it seems like the engineering talent hiring should slow down over time. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can weigh in on what\u2019s coming in or what\u2019s coming out. Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah, sure. I would say the margins \u2013 our margins expectations are that we will price competitively and continue to pass along pricing reductions to customers both in the form of absolute price reductions and also in the form of new products that will in effect cannibalize the old ones.  And we also see a point out that you know increasingly what we\u2019re doing is renegotiating or negotiating incremental price decreases for customers who then commit to us long term. And if you look at our disclosure on our 10-Q, it shows that we have $27 billion in future commitments for AWS, from AWS customers and that\u2019s up 54% year-over-year. So that\u2019s another thing to watch, it\u2019s not only the short-term commitment, but also the long-term commitment that we see. On the rest of the P&L, there again we have, I believe some of the best infrastructure people in the industry. If not the best, we are continually driving up efficiency and lowering costs and we see that in our bottom line.  The sales and marketing investment, we\u2019re chasing a large opportunity here and that will be, you know as we say bumpy as we go along, but we are fully confident that that will be a very leveraged cost as we get to scale.  And then on the technology side, as you said, yes we will continue and invest in SDEs and software engineers to build these you know products that customers love, continue to respond to their demands, and that will push or inform our product portfolio.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Can you talk about the key drivers of the acceleration in what looks like advertising revenue within other and related to that, the press release mentions I think you are now $37 million Fire Stick users worldwide. So can you talk about maybe how much ad inventory you\u2019ve been able to get inside of networks within that and how meaningful is this to the overall kind of advertising strategy. Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, so let me start with the first question on advertising. So other revenue, which is principally advertising grew 45% this quarter, up from 37% last quarter and the biggest thing in there is advertising and advertising grew at a rate higher than that 45%.  So we are very happy with the progress in the advertising business, continue to focus on advancing advertising experiences there, helpful for customers, helping them to see new products, we want to empower our businesses to find attracting and engage these customers and it\u2019s increasingly popular with vendor sellers and third-party advertisers. So it\u2019s still early and what we\u2019re focused on really at this point is relevancy, making sure that the ads are relevant to our customers, helpful to our customers, and to do that, we use machine learning and that\u2019s helping us to drive better, better and better relevancy.\nDave Fildes: Yeah. And then Lloyd, this is Dave. Just quickly on Fire TV. I mean I have to start with the fact that we did recently introduce 20 new Fire TV products, so that includes the new \u2013 and the first Fire TV Edition Sound Bar, Fire TV Cube. So a number of things have come out recently. We\u2019re really excited to get into customers\u2019 hands, so more to come there.  I think specifically on the advertising side and the opportunity with that, we are continuing to see some increased adoption. You know one of our areas of focus is expanding our video and OTT offerings for brands. It\u2019s still early in this space, but we\u2019ve done a few things with IMDb TV, Live Sports, things like adding more inventory through Fire TV apps, and as I said IMDb TV, adding more OTT video supply through Amazon Publisher Services or APS integrations and streamlining access for third party apps and really just making it easier for advertisers to manage their campaigns and provide better results. So, as I said early days, but I think with the engagement of the device community, the fact that we\u2019re really excited with the progress and improvements of these devices, I think yeah, again a lot of opportunity there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed.\nScott Devitt: Thanks. There has been a meaningful reacceleration in paid unit growth in the past two quarters with the expansion of the One Day guarantees for Prime customers, and I\u2019m just wondering if consumers are responding more in certain categories that you would highlight over others or is the response fairly broad-based across the product categories where One Day has been expanded? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Hi, Scott. Yeah, what I can tell you is that yes, the unit growth has been reaccelerated in the last two quarters and actually Amazon Fulfilled unit growth is growing at a higher clip. So we do attribute it to One Day.  We\u2019re seeing broad sales across all categories. So you know there has been some reduction in the threshold for some lower ASP items that we\u2019ve been doing separately over the last six months that have spurred some sales in lower ASP items, but we think that is again the right decision for customers, especially over the long term.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nMark Mahaney: Hey, thanks, I want to go back to AWS. When asked about margins, you first referred to \u2013 Brian you first referred to by bringing down prices. Are you seeing anything different in terms of the level of price competition? Could you talk about what kind of traction you\u2019ve had building out into the enterprise, and I know it\u2019s a broad question, but take a shot at it. And third part of this is, your interest and your success in going in and generating more app \u2013 you know going up the stack and getting more into the application software space, all that AWS related. Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Hi, Mark. So yeah, I would say my comments around pricing were as much mix as absolute price decreases or competitive price pressures. It\u2019s certainly a competitive market that we see and we\u2019ve seen for really a number of years. So everyone is very sharp on their pricing and is very eager to lock up long-term commitments from AWS customers.  We do it with you know a combination of price and capability that we think is unmatched. So the bigger element of that really is around us creating new products and services that are cheaper and less expensive than the old ones. So there is a certain bit of mix issue that we are always up against.  But again in your question on enterprise penetration, you know I think the enterprise, we\u2019re making great progress there. You know it\u2019s going to be hard on revenue growth, it\u2019s going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s hard to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations that companies are willing to make or some are faster than others and some have other work to do before they can migrate.  So you know there\u2019s a lot of factors at play there on the enterprise business, but we are having great success and we\u2019re adding a lot of sales force or sales representatives, especially for the enterprise market.\nDave Fildes: Yeah, and Mark, this is Dave. Just really quickly just in terms of your question on the stack. I mean I think for really since as long as AWS has been around, we really pride ourselves in getting really top, high caliber people both in the technical side, but also sales people that are plugged in and listening to customers, understanding issues that are emerging, having open lines of communication and that\u2019s really allowed us to innovate quickly and really faster than anyone else, and we see that in the terms of the service and feature breadth and depth that we have. So, a lot of the focus for us is really making sure that that flywheel keep spinning, and that we continue to roll out a lot of great services the customers are looking for. So I think that\u2019s largely what dictates our roadmap and making sure that we give ourselves autonomy and availability to look to new areas and stay on the cusp of whether it\u2019s kind of emerging technologies or really just our customer needs or pain points that need to be solved.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks. Maybe first is a follow-up on the logistics and delivery side. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some sense for the portion of SKUs in the U.S. or orders in the U.S. that are now delivered through your own network of drivers and partners.  And then secondly, there have been some reports that Amazon is or on occasion is delivering products for other merchants or suppliers, not specifically tied to an Amazon order. So just wondering if you view this as another potential opportunity down the road as you get excess capacity and on the logistics side? Thanks.\nDave Fildes: Yeah Colin, hey it\u2019s Dave. Thanks for the question. On that second point, in terms of how we think about the capacity we might have for our own, I think you know \u2013 I\u2019d start with, you know we\u2019ve got a great relationship with third party carriers across the countries where we operate.  Over time I think you know we\u2019ll look and expect to be able to grow our internal volume using AMZL or Amazon Logistics, but also continue to grow our 3P volumes with carriers, transporters around the world. But our focus is really on ensuring that we\u2019ve got capacity from available resources, whether it\u2019s our own or our great carrier partners to be able to serve the small and medium-sized businesses in the 3P realm, but also the first party items that we are receiving orders from customers, making sure we\u2019re able to deliver those things quickly and reliably.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you all; it\u2019s going to be a couple here. Just wondering back on the shorter holiday season, do you think that\u2019s going to be a headwind for overall online sales in the quarter, anything specific to Amazon?  And then secondly, just thinking about the regulatory environment. I wonder if you could just comment on the opportunities and the competitiveness for third-party sellers. Are there other platforms that you see for them and how do you think about their profitability on Amazon, if you can comment on that at all? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, yeah. On third party I would say we only succeed if the third party sellers succeeds. So we\u2019re heavily invested in them as they are in us. So we are constantly investing on their behalf, adding new products and features and you know we are cognizant of their economics as well and we want a business that works for both of us and we set our fees accordingly. So I think that you know we\u2019ve \u2013 and I\u2019ll also point out that with the One Day, the increase in One Day sellers have participated, and not as much as anyone else, as much as our 1P offering. So, it\u2019s been a great boon for sellers as well as, particularly in our FBA program.  On the holiday season question, we are not anticipating that the move of you know the shorter time period between Thanksgiving and you know Christmas Day is going to be that impactful. What we found in the past is that there is generally a holiday budget that is spent somewhere between November 15 and - November 1 maybe and December 25, and well certainly Black Friday and Cyber Monday are important dates in that holiday period.  You know there is - the purchase tend to move around. Some have been moving early in the quarter, some of them moving later in the quarter as customers can count on and receive very quick shipments at the end and have higher faith in delivery just before the holidays. So that\u2019s a little bit color, that\u2019s what\u2019s anticipated in our guidance that we\u2019ve given.\nDave Fildes: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter.

It looks like the overall retail business accelerated pretty nicely in the quarter. Maybe could you just talk about whether 24-hour shipping is in that? So which specific categories of consumption are you seeing really drive that acceleration? And then sort of the opposite question on AWS, which has slowed a little bit can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in the AWS revenue growth this quarter versus the prior Q? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Brian. Thanks for your questions. Let me start with AWS. We feel this really strong quarter. We had a growth year-over-year in our run rate from $24 billion to $33 billion, so 37% growth. The $9 billion that we increased our run rate by was second only to Q4 of last year as far as our history. So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers we've been breaking it out for 2015 and we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms and we're seeing a pick up from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services especially our machine learning services. And continually again AWS is being chosen as a partner to many companies because of our leadership position both in technology, our vibrant partner ecosystem, and also the stronger security that we offer. On your question about one-day, let me update you on that, because obviously that was a big topic of conversation last quarter and you can see that it's starting to show up in our results in Q2. So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing one-day offering. In Q2, we had a meaningful step up in the one-day shipments, primarily in North America. And volume -- one-day volume was accelerating throughout the quarter. The ops team did a fantastic job here, not only in being able to expand one-day selection and delivery capacity, but also preparing for and handling some very high volumes on Prime Day earlier in the month. So we're in the middle of the journey here. We expect to see continued ramp of the one-day selection availability for the next few quarters both in North America and international. International was up slightly in Q2, but for the most part, the improvement in delivery speeds will be in future quarters there. On the cost side, we talked last time about $800 million estimate of transportation cost to supply one day, the additional one day in Q2. We were a little bit higher than that number in total cost. We saw some additional transition costs in our warehouses. We saw some lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly, both local capacity in the off-season also in our delivery networks. We also saw some costs were moving -- buying more inventory and moving inventory around in our network to have it be closer to customers. And we built that not only that cost structure, but an accelerating cost penalty into our Q3 guidance that was released with our earnings today. And as I said in other setting, we've seen this before. We have had large changes to our distribution and transportation network repeatedly in our history from going from media to a vast variety of different product lines hardlines non-sortable as we call them. The initial two-day Prime shipping offer that we launched many years ago, the great expansion of our network to include FBA merchants and capacity for them and more recently, the first steps to increase one-day and same day although on a much smaller scale. So, it does create a shock to the system. We're working through that now. We expect we'll be working through that for a number of quarters, but when the dust settles, we will regain our cost efficiency over time. As far as you asked about specific product lines, nothing really to share there. We have seen lower ASP generally in Q2, higher unit growth versus revenue growth in North America and we could be that we're mixing into some lower ASP items as we launch one-day, but we haven't drawn that total conclusion yet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thanks. Just wondering back on the AWS side of things, can you give us a sense of sort of what you're seeing from a volume perspective? Obviously, price is always a big component of growth in this, but just trying to understand whether or not you're seeing similar trends in terms of growth rate deceleration on the volume side of things. And then to the extent that we're sort of thinking about the mix of either revenue or usage within that business. Are there any products or sort of product areas AI obviously being one that's been a major initiative for you that you're seeing particular either outside growth or under growth relative to the overall business that you would call out?\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. On that second point, I'd say we're seeing a lot of increased adoption and machine learning services especially Amazon Sage Maker. We've had tens of thousands of customers who are now using AWS machine learning services and we'll continue to innovate on behalf of those customers. We released more than 200 machine learning features and capabilities in 2018 alone in this area. Database is also a multibillion-dollar business propelled by Aurora. So we're seeing a lot of strength. We're seeing strong usage growth that outpaces revenue growth as usual increased pace of enterprise migrations. So, I would say that on a percentage growth basis again on a dollar basis, it's going very strongly. On a percentage growth basis, we are lapping some very strong growth in the first half of last year. We were growing about 50% in the first half of last year. There's some particular unique customer volumes that were flowing through that some customers have really high usage tied to their businesses. But for the most part, we continue to grow usage and our expansion of our services with all of our customers. So very happy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJustin Post: Great. Couple of questions. I guess, the first question is just happens with the customer behavior when they do have one-day availability? I'm assuming units go up, but can you give us any details on what happens or a category that switches to one-day what happens? And the second question, we've heard from some smaller checks that some of the smaller merchants are moving to 3P, not getting orders on the one piece side as much. Is there any change in your business there to really kind of focus more towards third-party from first-party? Thanks a lot.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. No, we don't have category specifics to really share with you today on the move to one-day. I did say that generally in Q2 the unit volume was greater than revenue volume. So we did see some lower ASPs. But I think what you're saying is just a lot more products enter the consideration set for our customers. So things that maybe they can't wait two days on, they can wait one day, and it lights up a whole separate usefulness for the Amazon site. I've noticed that personally myself that just -- with one-day shipments, it's here before you know it. So what categories that hits specifically, we'll have to see over time. On your comment, I assume you meant vendors not merchants, but on the move from 1P to 3P, but no there shouldn't be -- I can't highlight anything related shifting in channel there, but I would say that we remain in different on whether -- we're focused on price convenience and selection for our customers. And whether product is a retail offering or third-party offering is not that important to us. As long as it's in stock, as long as it's priced competitively. So, as you know our 3P selection has -- our 3P percent of units has been increasing over time and increased again in this quarter to 54% of units. We continue to invest very heavily in our systems both for retail vendors and also for third-party merchants invest billions of dollars a year on behalf of then making Amazon a better place for customers to buy and increasingly not only vendor sales, but also third-party merchant sales. In particular on Prime Day, I think you'll see that we had -- over in the press release, we had more than $2 billion of products were bought from small and medium-sized businesses. So when we win, we win together with our vendor partners and also our seller partners.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. So in the release you made a comment about automotive and Alexa, anything you want to elaborate a little more that looks like that's a very interesting opportunity? And then with respect to India, there were two comments in the release, but anything you can comment on kind of getting past some of the issues that had impacted the business in the past? I know you're past that now. Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Let me start with India. So yes, continue to see growth in programs for both sellers -- for our sellers and delivery partners. In the last 18 months, we've doubled the number of paid Prime member, which we're very excited about. We've invested a lot in our global selling program, which helps Indian sellers not only reach customers in India, but also in other geographies around the world. We started Amazon Flex in India, which helps our local partners to deliver packages, gives them jobs, grows our delivery capacity for sellers and increases our speed of delivery. So it's a win-win. We've also introduced package-free shipment program in nine cities. This is going to be a big part of our shipment zero program, a vision to make all Amazon shipment net carbon zero. On the government side, our engagement with the Indian government makes us optimistic about partnering and collaborating to seek a stable predicable policy that allow us to continue investing in our technology and infrastructure. And it also helps us to create jobs and scale local businesses. So, we think there's a lot of shared purpose there and a good quarter where we're looking forward to the Diwali holiday this year. The events we have for Diwali were all in Q4 last year some of them are in Q3 this year based on the timing of the holiday. So, that's factored into our international \u2013 excuse me, our, revenue growth rate for the quarter.\nDave Fildes: Yes, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the Alexa point and auto, Alexa is really a more and more place. I think the point you're probably referencing is, we're now seeing hundreds of third-party devices with Alexa built in. So that runs the gamut from smart thermostat and another smart home devices, headphones, but also vehicle. So we've seen a lot of good partnerships and arrangements with companies like BMW and Mini and not just in the U.S., but in places like Europe as well. So a lot of this of course is just around the great power of Alexa and being able to offer even greater convenience and touch points where customers can interact with that and we're seeing a lot of good momentum with usage and how customers are interacting with Alexa. But also when you look at the broader environment of third-party devices, devices that we're rolling out in all of those things it's -- we're seeing a lot of good momentum there. And I think it's underpinned by the fact that Alexa is always getting smarter and so customers are enjoying the benefit of that enhanced experience.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. Please proceed.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions for me please. Can you quantify the cost of one-day shipping to Q3 guidance kind of similarly to what you did into 4Q too with that $800 million? And if they plateau how should be thinking about it, as we map it out over the next several quarters? And then you guys made a very intriguing acquisition, the Sizmek acquisition sometime back. I'm just wondering, how does it fit in the overall strategy? And is the idea to try to build may be a double click like-minded model, sorry using that platform? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Hi, Youssef. Let me start your question on one-day. I'm not breaking out the specific cost this quarter as I did last year -- last quarter. Some of this is because it's very hard to pinpoint exactly the lines between one-day and other cost issues. So we're always working within a range. We're confidently we were near but just above our $800 million estimate in Q2. And as I said, this is going to take multiple quarters to play out. We had a meaningful step up in North America in Q2 and it was accelerating through the quarter. We'll see more cost in Q3. We'll see about Q4 when we talk and everything we know about or anticipate about Q3 is built into our guidance. So I wouldn't break out the dollar term. I will tell you at the end of the quarter kind of what we're seeing on cost and how it looks for Q4 as well. And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that, we're just getting started in international and most of that work is ahead of us although the speed that tick up a bit in Q1 -- excuse me Q2 but -- and will do even more so in Q3 in future quarters.\nDave Fildes: Yes. And then just on Sizmek quickly. We are excited to have acquired the Sizmek ad server and then Sizmek's dynamic creative optimization or DCO. Customers are going to be able to continue to use those proven products and services. We're invested in the long-term success of Sizmek. And again, Amazon advertising and Sizmek has many mutual customers, so we know how valued these prudent solutions are to the customer base. So we're looking forward to work with that team and we'll share more updates as we invent and create new opportunities to serve advertisers in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Sir, your line is live.\nMark Mahaney: Sorry about that. Hey Brian could you talk a little bit about the elasticity you're seeing -- you expect to see in international markets with the rollout of one-day? And I just -- the commentary in the press release about this acceleration from one-day, sounds great. It's a little surprising that you would see the reaction that quickly. But maybe this really is -- well you're obviously seeing it. You're confident you'll also see it as you roll out into international markets, if you could just comment on that? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. The -- of course the proportion of one-day shipments is higher in international to begin with in a lot of our countries. So we will -- we expect it to be very valuable to customers as we add selection into that one-day category. But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America where the standard has been 2-day shipping for Prime. So yes, I would say, you're faced with the -- you see it every time you go to our site. It's automatically built in. You're surprised by the speed. It's not like you have to search one-day shipping specifically to find out what's available. It's growing and it's pervasive. So I think what that does is, again it strengthens your purchase decision, it strengthens the need to not have to go elsewhere to buy a product because you need it quickly. So I think it's becomes a part of your routine. At least that's what we're seeing in North America. And we hope again as we build this capacity to more and more regions and more and more ZIP codes and adding more and more selection that everyone will see the same thing that we see already in major cities. I do want to add one point though because when we talk about operating income in both in Q2 and Q3 and we talk about the cost and penalty of one-day, I would like to highlight there's some other investment areas that are certainly going on here. If you look at Q2, our marketing expense was up 48% year-over-year and that's a combination of a few things. First, we're continuing to add our AWS sales and marketing teams. We see great opportunity there to help customers engage with our services and migrate to our products. So we continue to build out our sales force and our marketing programs. We're also adding more and more advertising as we roll out devices and Prime Video -- new Prime Video content in particular internationally. So we're seeing higher marketing costs. We're also seeing a higher stock-based compensation expense. That was up 36% year-over-year. And you'll see that our headcount grew 13% year-over-year. So when you look at some of our most quickly growing areas things like Alexa and AWS and also teams working on machine learning and other high-end technical projects, our technical headcount actually grew twice that rate or nearly twice that rate based on total headcount. So there's a lot of moving parts within our headcount number, but there's a very strong investment going on in AWS devices and videos in particular.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRoss Sandler: Hey guys, just two questions. The North America retail acceleration was 3.5 points and you mentioned international is about one. So can we attribute the difference to one-day? Or was there other organic acceleration in North America happening aside from the move to one-day? And then Brian related to that investing question, AWS operating margin came down a bit. I know they had a tough comp. But anything you would call out aside from the headcount stuff that you just mentioned that may have been lumpy in the quarter on AWS? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with that second question. So yes -- sorry, the operating margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate it's such a rapidly growing business with different timing of investments and global expansion in investment in marketing and other infrastructure that is going to vary quarter-to-quarter. We had a -- we've come off a period where if you remember last year we had less investment needed in infrastructure both for AWS and for Amazon in total. The -- I don't have the number directly in front of me, but anyway we grew finance leases, which is essentially our props for capital leases for infrastructure by 9% in Q1 and it was 10% all of last year coming off a year in 2017 where we had growth of 69%. So we had that dynamic. Our trailing 12-month growth in that number is 21% after Q2. So it's stepped up from 9% to 21%. So we are starting to see as I mentioned in earlier calls that the investment will be stepping up in 2019, so started to see that in Q2. But the biggest, I would say the biggest impact in this operating profit was the addition of sales and marketing personnel in AWS and also to a lesser extent the stock-based compensation, which certainly hits across all of our businesses. Your comment on revenue growth differential, I mean there's so many different factors going on in every country that's hard to compare North America to international. But I would say that we are attributing a good bit of the revenue growth acceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the rollout of one-day and the impact of that. If there's other things, obviously, we continue to add selection and we have again lots of engagement points of customers through Prime Benefits and video and devices that certainly contribute to our revenue run rate in our retention of Prime members. But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 that's different -- Q2 excuse me, that's different it was obviously the start of the -- and the step up in one-day shipments.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Pleased proceed.\nMark May: Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. First I guess sort of an organizational question, but some of the feedback I've heard from the ecosystem is that it appears that the combination of the way Amazon's organized internally and just rapid growth in the ad business 1P, 3P that at times there are signs that kind of these teams internally are not always aligned and maybe that creates some issues. And just wonder first do you generally agree with this? And if so, what is the company doing to kind of better optimize these increasingly related functions that maybe in the past haven't always been organized internally that way? And then secondly in terms of subscription revenue where are we in terms of the benefit from the price increase announcement announced last year and rolled through to existing members throughout the last year and will this have any meaningful impacts in that lines growth say in Q3 of the back half of the year? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. So, I assume your first question is about the coordination of advertiser with teams that are interacting with vendors and sellers, perhaps is that what you meant?\nMark May: Exactly. Yes.\nBrian Olsavsky: Okay. Yes, so, first, I'd say we're customer-focused first and primarily, but we need to have good coordination across our teams and we grow fast and we add new things. So, there's always learnings that we have that's why we say it's still day one here. But we're trying to minimize the negative impact on any vendor or seller out there. So, I can't comment on any certain -- on exactly what issues you might be talking about. We have teams dedicated to the seller experience and the vendor experience and we think they do a good job of selling the whole suite of products including advertising -- with the advertising teams at Amazon. But as you say they're separately run and they can meet at different points and sometimes at certain vendors perhaps that may get out of hand are get out of sync. But hopefully that is a temporary condition. On subscription revenue, yes, we -- you remember we raised the price of Prime in the U.S. last June from $99 to $119. So, the largest impact -- favorable impact from that at least from a subscription revenue standpoint would have happened in the subsequent four quarters, less in Q2, more in Q3 through Q2 of this year. So, yes, that will be a factor that we're comping for the next 12 months. Its offset by the growth in the Prime program itself and the expansion of Prime Benefits or the Prime program globally. You may see that -- may have seen we have launched Prime in United Arab Emirates this quarter. So, it's not something -- it's something we've certainly seen in the past with timing of price increases, but it's built into the Q3 guidance that I've given.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thanks. I guess first up curious just a follow-up on the ASP comments if those were \u2013 if that shift within the same categories or just lower ASPs imply diversification into new categories. But my main question is just looking ahead of the holiday period given some of the moving parts and 3PL and shipping ecosystem and then of course with the transition to one-day, are you confident that there is enough capacity from your own first-party logistics as well as third-party partners to meet that seasonal demand and should we now expect a faster ramp in Amazon Air as the means to move cargo between fulfillment centers? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. So, I would say the first time we started discussing the rollout of one-day our first thoughts went to Q4 this year and our capability for holiday and as much as Q2 and Q3. So we are confident that we will have the ability to handle seasonal demand. We are working very hard to expand our one-day capacity, add carriers, add delivery partners at our own AMZL capability and have our partners expand their capabilities as well. So we're feeling good about Q4. It's a little early to discuss that now, but we certainly had a really good test on Prime Day. It was the two biggest days we've ever had. A lot of good work went into Prime Day, a lot of benefit for customers, a lot of benefit for our selling partners, the small business merchants as well. So it was a good test for us. And, sorry, your question on low ASP, I think we're still figuring that out a bit. I mean they -- what I'm reacting to is the high unit growth relative to good growth in revenue, but unit growth grew faster. I'm always a little vary to put too much into the unit growth number. As I've talked in other quarters, it's a number that's excludes AWS subscription services, advertising and Whole Foods, which are some of the fastest growing areas and we also have \u2013 are actively selling subscription services like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited, which can cannibalize unit sales. So there's a lot of moving parts, usually our headwinds to our unit growth number, but again happy with the 800 basis point quarter-over-quarter jump in that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Brian just on the op income guide for the next quarter, it's significantly below where many of us are at. I'm curious if you could just talk to any changes around expenses and the success of one day just doubling down or can you just walk through what's transpires in the next quarter? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. So again the biggest individual item is the one-day shipping. As I said earlier, we had a meaningful step up in shipments in Q2 versus Q1, but we're still on our way and Q3 will be a step up over Q2 in North America and we'll see more in international. So it's -- that increase in one-day shipping and all the associated cost of additional transportation and getting capacity in place. As I mentioned earlier new costs and things like expanding inventory, getting it closer to the customer. Just a lot of things moving -- a lot of moving parts in the fulfillment center world right now and our transport networks. So that is the biggest individual contributor but as I mentioned in Q2's results, some of the investments in marketing, the step up in infrastructure spending that should continue. We certainly have a lot of areas where we continue to invest not the least of which is our AWS business, devices, video, the global expansion of a lot of our Prime Benefits and things like stores and grocery delivery through Whole Foods, Prime Now and AmazonFresh. So I would say, yes, we had -- as we've mentioned the last couple of calls, we had some lessening of expenses in some key areas last year, mostly tied to headcount growth, infrastructure and fulfillment capacity. We expected a step up in 2019. We didn't see as much of it in Q1, mainly because of the timing of the seasonality of the year and getting things going. We\u2019re seeing more of it in Q2 and we'll see it through the remainder of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much. Maybe a few small questions on the advertising side of the business if I can. How much of the advertising business would you be willing to say is driven by domestic sellers and domestic brands versus the international side? Two, how do you think about the video ad revenue opportunity? We continue to hear from a lot of people in the advertising industry that you might be a bigger player in video advertising later this year or more into next year, how do you think about making investments against that possibility or even just possibility of being a driver in your platform overall? Thanks so much for the color guys.\nDave Fildes: Yes, Eric this is Dave. I think started with the video advertising that one focus areas for us is expanding our video and over the top offerings for brands. We've taken some steps with live sports and then IMDb TV, but we'll continue to do things like add more OTT video supply, just things like Amazon Publisher service integrations and simplifying access for third-party apps and add more inventory through things like Fire TV apps and IMDb TV. So some interesting areas that we're continue to put a lot of focus into. Now the first part of your question, in terms of geographical mix, I mean, fair to assume that like a lot of our business, advertising in the North America segment is the bigger piece of that, but I think we're really excited about the international opportunity. A lot of the tools that we've rolled out introduced in places like the United States aren't available in many of the international regions. And so, it's a matter of continuing to work with advertisers and brands and kind of buildup, not only awareness but just how those -- add things like sponsored products interact with customers and how they receive -- building up the things we talk about many times here around improving relevancy on each of those geographic websites is an important thing that we're measuring. So, expected to continue see us look for new ways to be able to roll that out.\nDave Fildes: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-04-25 23:05:06", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nShelly Kay Pfeiffer: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2019 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\nOperator: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. You're now live.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Hey, I'm going to ask two questions, because the first one is really simple. Unit growth of 10%, is this a meaningless metric, just talk through that number. I think it's the lowest unit growth I think we've ever seen, but just talk to us a little bit about that. And then international sales growth decelerated 16%, I know last - ex-FX. I know last quarter you talked about some challenges in the India market. Just give us some color, please, around that growth rate, how do we think about the sustainability of that? Was that negatively impacted by developments in India? Thanks a lot.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. I'd start on unit growth. So unit growth was 10%. Again, as I mentioned last quarter, it is a measurement, excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, advertising, subscription services, which cannibalize the unit calculation, things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited. And then, also it doesn't include Whole Foods Market. So while it is meaningful, it needs to be understood and caveated. So your question was on international growth. Yeah, talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we're just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. There were a few days of downtime for some of our selection. But for the full quarter the impact was minimal. And we're in compliance and very, very happy with the progress of the business in India. So as far as the growth is concerned in international, we had some noise in Q3 and Q4, if you'll remember with the timing of the Diwali holiday. But we feel pretty good about the Q1 growth there, even despite some downtime in India.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. You are now live.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I'll also ask two, if I can. Just first, Brian, can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q? Increased significantly there, it looks like cost of sales and the fulfillment, but hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the margin be materially lower in 2Q as you're guiding? And then just second, on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX-neutral basis, the higher end implies a nice acceleration, so curious what gives you the confidence in that. Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Doug. Yeah, let's start with Q1. So you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and 2017, dropped to 15% last year. Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That dropped to 14% last year. And then, financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%. So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1. So we had continued efficiency. We didn't put a lot of new fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to Q1 of last year. And hiring was moderate; we actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis. So I would say that is a continuation of last year. But my point from the last call still holds in that, we do expect those growth rates to be higher for all of 2019. So most of that will happen in the next three quarters, and we have that built into the Q2 guidance. We also hit the high-end of the revenue range, which is always good from an efficiency standpoint and the drop-through on the higher end of the revenue. So now turning into Q2, I would like to tell you a bit about why that's lower. So we have - we're currently working on evolving our Prime free Two-Day Shipping program to be a free One-Day Shipping program. We're able to do this, because we spent 20 plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us. For Q2 guidance, we've included approximately $800 million of incremental spend related to this investment. And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than Two-Day Shipping for Prime members for years, one day, same day, even down to one to two hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to offer same day and Prime Now selection in an accelerated basis. But this is all about the core free Two-Day offer morphing into - or evolving into a free One-Day offer. We've already started down this path. We've in the past months significantly expanded our one-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for one-day shipping. So we're taking a significant step. It wasn't showing up in Q1. It was minimal in Q1's results. It's a significant step and it will take us time to achieve. And we want to ensure that we have good delivery experience for our customers as we evolve this offer. And lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we - Q2 is a time when we grant RSUs to employees. And we traditionally see a step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2, and we're seeing the same thing this year.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: And that - sorry, and that's also tied in with your question about revenue acceleration. We do believe that, although there's not explicit lift built in for the faster shipping, we have seen good order trends month to date. And we expect - we built the Q2 range about - around what we've seen.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. You are now live.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. As users consume more services and maybe get less boxes, although I guess you could see a pickup in Q2, what does that mean for customer stickiness? How are you thinking about getting more advertising and getting more subscription services? And maybe you could just give us a little insight into what you're seeing with Prime churn especially in the more mature U.S. market? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. Sure. Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had more people sign up for Prime in 2018 than any other year before. So we are very happy with the - not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement. Our engagement in video benefit - excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky. So while I can't share - I wouldn't share with you today the Prime - any Prime - specific Prime statistics about churn, it does remain a very compelling program. I think, the announcement I just made about morphing to a one-day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in retail, as we say.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. You're now live.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4. Q4 was a fairly big step-down, when you strip out the accounting benefit or the last quarter, the accounting benefit. Can you talk a little bit about the supply and demand dynamics in the advertising business? How much of that will you might be controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to advertise among sellers on the platform? And any color you could give us on what you might be seeing in the advertising business domestically versus internationally would be helpful. Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Yeah, we are seeing - as you can see in the operating margin, we're seeing a good advertising growth both in North America and also internationally. While I can't get into some of the questions about ad loads and inventory, I would say really what we're focused on right now is driving relevancy, ensuring that we service the most useful ad as possible. I think that's going to be the best experience for customers and also for advertisers. So most of our focus has been on again adding more functionality, adding more products and adding - reporting for businesses and advertisers, so they can understand the incremental customers they're seeing on Amazon through advertising with Amazon. So it's more right now about tools and making better recommendations, making it easier to use our Amazon demand-side platform, things like that, operational improvements. And then, I guess, we're very focused on serving brands as well. That's another theme that we have. These brand stores that we have are easy to create, customize, and we've had great pickup on that from brands, but they can show shoppers who they are and tell their story. So it builds a better engagement for the brand and the customer. It builds better customer loyalty both to that brand and also to Amazon. And then on the brand side itself, we have new reporting - excuse me, where we're again looking to measure the new to the brand shoppers and what lift they're seeing. So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency and also performance of the advertisement themselves. The other revenue growth that you see does include some non-advertising things as well. So while other revenue grew 36%, and it is principally advertising, advertising grew a bit higher than that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. You're now live.\nStephen Ju: I'm sure you can share in regards to the Prime users' awareness of the availability of stuff from Whole Foods. Is the order flow coming in from a wide number of users? Or is the activity coming in from a small, but very dedicated number of customers? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that we're very - it's widespread and more Prime members have adopted the Whole Foods benefit than almost any other benefit we've offered them, and they're saving, as a result, hundreds of millions of dollars. We continue to expand the coverage for delivery. We have delivery from 75 - into 75 U.S. metros through the Prime Now app, and we also have pickup in over 30 metros also through the Prime Now app. So we're very - excuse me, the other point I'll make is just like last quarter, I'll remind you that the physical stores revenue is principally Whole Foods revenue, but it excludes the online ordering component where people order on the Prime Now app and it's delivered to them. That shows up in our online stores classification. So last quarter, I told you that our growth in store sales, including both shopping and also online deliveries, was closer to 6% in Q4, and it's a similar number in Q1. So again, we're very happy with both the Prime adoption of the - or the recognition of the Prime benefits by - at Whole Foods, and also the purchases. And you may have also noticed that we lowered prices for the third major round of price cuts, since we joined forces with Whole Foods in the summer of 2017.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. You're now live.\nDaniel Salmon: Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe, Brian, just to return to the advertising business for a moment. It does sound like, as Eric noted, that there was a bit more of a slowdown again. I mean, I guess, I'll ask it this way. Do you believe that some of the improved relevance, some of the improved focus on brands as well as some of the new products can lead that business to reaccelerate at some point again? Or is it facing law of large numbers? And then just a follow-up, just to return to the $800 million investment to improve one-day shipping, it sounds like that investment is underway already and that - in noting that it'll help contribute to the high-end of the guidance this quarter, it sounds like the timing of that is fairly quicker. I would imagine, it's just simply expanding availability and that $800 million is largely related to shipping cost. But I just want to make sure, we're understanding that quickly that - this investment rolled out relatively quickly and starts to take effect relatively quickly.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. I'm glad you asked that. I would say that while our 20-year head start in investments in logistics and fulfillment capacity and partner networks that we've built are helping us, we also do have a network that is tuned to two-day delivery right now, principally for two-day delivery. So we do need to build out more one-day capacity along with our transportation partners, but we're moving quickly and we've got a good head start. There is a certain tranche that we can dial up quickly, and we've started to do that and you'll see that very quickly in Q2. And then stay tuned, because we'll be building this - most of this capacity through the year in 2019. And then your question about advertising, I wouldn't comment on acceleration or deceleration of growth. I would just say, we're early on in this venture. There's a lot of - it's having a lot of pickup by both vendors, sellers and also authors. So again, we feel like if we work on the inputs on this business and continue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good outcome in the advertising space.\nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Evercore. You're now live.\nAnthony DiClemente: Thanks very much. A couple of questions. In the shareholder letter, Jeff wrote third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt, and we read through that, but as we kind of look at the trending and the pacing of the 3P business, you can see a little bit of a deceleration in the 3P sellers services line and then 3P unit slowdown might suggest that the third-party GMV expansion may not be happening quite as fast. So maybe just talk a little bit about that. Is this just law of large numbers as time goes by? What is Amazon doing to sort of sustain that growth rate in the third-party marketplace business? And then second question is maybe just quickly on media spend. Just update us on how you're thinking about the trajectory of video content spend. Any strategic changes there in terms of library versus originals versus films or TV content? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. Let's step back on the third-party question. So again, let me reiterate our approach. So main goal here is that it will allow customers to have the broadest selection, the best available price and also the most convenient options on how they receive the item. If we're delivering on those three elements, we're indifferent as to whether it's sold by us or a third-party. We actively recruit sellers to sell on our platform, it's because it adds selection. It adds - if it's in the FBA program, it adds Prime eligible selection. We spend billions of dollars a year, as Jeff said, on infrastructure, tools and services, not only to allow sellers to sell, but to help themselves more successfully. So we have a vested interest in the success of our sellers. Any growth acceleration or deceleration that you see can be very much tied to the total sales of the customer - that we have the customers in any country. So you'll still see the percentage of third-party units increased and has been steadily over the last few years. So again, the sellers are as important to us as anything for servicing the customers' need for price selection and convenience. The elements I just talked about of investment, further investment in one-day shipping is directly going to be a cost that we bear and it's also going to be a direct benefit to sellers as well as the Prime eligible selection in our warehouses.\nDave Fildes: Yeah. And then, Anthony, just real quick, this is Dave, on your question around media and probably more particularly the video strategy and what we're investing in, I mean, we are continuing to invest meaningfully in digital video. It's an area where we're very excited about. Lots of very popular, critically acclaimed shows have obviously come out, things like Homecoming, Jack Ryan, more recently Hanna, Guava Island, and some great titles. So I think look for us to continue to invest there. There was - on the accounting side, we did adopt an accounting standard in January that amended our accounting for how we cap for produced original video content. And under that new guidance, we capitalize production cost for original video content. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of those costs. So the net impact for the first quarter to operating income wasn't material. It was - for Q1, the impact of a change was a decrease of about $130 million to cost of sales due to the capitalization change. As we go through 2019, though, we would expect the impact to increase in the latter part of the second half of the year, in line with our production schedule as it grows throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Blackledge from Cowen and Company. You're now live.\nJohn Blackledge: Great. Thanks. Just coming back to the Prime one-day delivery, will it be available to most of the U.S. by the holidays or by the end of the year? And I think you had about 100 million items available for two-day delivery, Prime delivery. As the one-day program starts, how many SKUs will be available? And would you expect to get the entire 100 million SKUs for one-day at some point? And then second question, just on grocery, just curious the upside for further expansion outside of kind of all the enhancements you're doing with Whole Foods. Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. So, yes, on the one-day free shipping versus the two-day free shipping, our goal is to evolve the two-day free shipping program into a one-day free shipping program and we're making strides on that. It got into a little bit about the capacity we have to add and changes we have to make to our supply chain in order to deliver on that. We expect to make steady progress quickly and through the year. We'll have more for you at the end of Q2 obviously. There's a lot of error bars around this program, especially from the cost side. We feel we're doing something very important for the customer. And we have - again trying to take advantage of the fulfillment capacity and transportation capacity especially with third-party partners that we have. And we'll just have to see what changes have to be made to get more and more selection into that one-day category.\nDave Fildes: And then, this is Dave again. Just on the grocery side of it, as you mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods Market growth over 500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that out. We are also continuing to invest in our other grocery initiatives. Amazon Fresh, Prime Now, which offers grocery as one of the components of the selection there for the two-hour or even one-hour delivery capabilities. And so I think, we'll keep investing in those areas. I mean\u2013 and in other initiatives as well, where we can get food through Pantry, Go, there's a number of initiatives there. So excited about what we'll be able to continue to bring to customers on that space.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Schachter from Macquarie Group. You're now live.\nBen Schachter: So more on the one-day shipping. Should we expect that to rely mostly on USPS, UPS or other shipping services or you're really going to try to build out more your Amazon owned and operated shipping? And on the numbers, $800 million for the quarter, how should we think about that ramping into the back half of the year? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. Sure, Ben. I would say, we're going to be using all of the available levers that we have right now, both AMZL and also third-party carriers, and we'll just see how it develops going forward. But we're going to need definitely continued support of our external transportation partners. So outside of the ramp, I would say that the $800 million is what I have for you today. We will see where we stand at the end of the quarter, and I'll give you insight as to what we just saw and what our outlook is for future quarters at that time. I would like to - as I don't want to run out of time here. So I'm going to ask a question for myself about AWS, because I want to get some information to you. Most of the questions I can tell around one-day are topical and important. I do want to highlight the AWS performance in Q1. We're now over $30 billion annualized run rate, 42% FX-neutral growth and $2 billion more of revenue this Q1 versus last Q1. The operating margin has also expanded in that time period by 320 basis points as a result of a lot of the good work on infrastructure and efficiencies that I talked about earlier in the call, because this is against a backdrop of a very large expansion of our tech teams and our sales teams that supports this business. We're continuing to engage with many large customers globally. I'm particularly happy about the Volkswagen alliance that we've joined up with them to power their Volkswagen Industrial Cloud. That's going to integrate more than 30,000 facilities and 1,500 suppliers and partners in Volkswagen's global supply chain over time. We have deals going with Ford on powering the cars of the future, Lyft, Gogo, a lot of really good customer wins in the quarter. And I think just more broadly, we're seeing continued momentum in enterprise migrations to AWS, and people are moving their workloads to AWS at a faster pace. Usage growth continues to be higher than revenue growth rates.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark May from Citi. You're now live.\nMark May: Thank you. And actually a follow-on to AWS, the growth clearly impressive, but we did see, I think sequentially, and I apologize I'm not in front of model, but I think the growth was somewhere at 3%, 4% sequentially. There was a little bit of a slowdown in the quarter. Just wondered if there's anything that you'd call out there, pricing or any other factors that you could call out, that may have contributed to that. And apologize, but another one-day shipping question here. In terms of the $800 million, just curious where that gets you to, in terms of coverage of zip codes and SKUs? I assume right now this is a project that's in the US. And where that gets you from a coverage standpoint? And is this something that you expect to be a near- to medium-term priority in some of your other developed markets like the UK, Germany, et cetera? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. So I'm glad you asked that. So, Mark, it's - let me start with that second question. The program will be global. Most of the spend that we are seeing in Q2 is starting in North America. But this is intended to be a global improvement in speed tied to our Prime program. So you will see more going forward. I can't give you exact percentages of selection and all that, mainly because we are still again working through that. And while we have ratcheted up a significant - we turned the dial significantly in April. And so we'll see the cost impact almost immediately in the quarter. We're really going to have to see how it goes this quarter, both on our pace of selection addition and expansion of one-day, and let you know probably at the end of the quarter. I would say in the short run, it's also expanding and increasing our speed on all of our orders quite frankly. On AWS revenue, let me just remind you that quarterly growth last year on an FX-neutral basis, so Q1 was 48%, then 49%, then 46% and 46%. So in the first half of the year, we have a tougher comp, if you will, versus some strong growth in the first-half of last year. This is always going to be a lumpy business. It's not only dependent on us, it's also dependent on the companies that are adopting Amazon, so there's a - or excuse me, AWS. So there are differences in sales cycles. There are differences in adoption of the cloud. There are differences in migration patterns that will make any quarter-to-quarter movements lumpy, as I said. So we're happy with the growth, 42% on an FX-neutral basis and again a $30 billion - greater than $30 billion annualized run rate.\nOperator: Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. You are now live.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. I guess somewhat along those lines or at least along the lines of growth, we saw CapEx spending and investment in capital leases decelerate to the lowest rate that it's been in several years, maybe even the lowest rate ever. And you guys have said in the past that generally CapEx sort of tracks your - that you're investing at the level of growth that you expect. I'm sure that's not representative of what you expect growth to look like. So just trying to understand sort of where the disconnect is there, and to the extent that your - the level of investment in physical infrastructures says anything about your expectations for future growth, what the right way to read that is?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for that question, Heath. No, I would say, A, we're not expecting diminished returns in any of our businesses or growth rates nor are we restraining the business or constraining the business in any way with our capital. I would point you back again to the investments that we made in 2016 and 2017. So we did front-load a lot of the investment both in fulfillment centers and also infrastructure. But more than that, it's more than kind of leading through excess capacity. We have some really, really impressive gains and efficiencies in both the warehouses and also the data centers. We talk efficiency. And every percentage utilization in our data centers is worth tens and more millions of dollars. So again, that's a big part of our model. It is not only investing, but also working on efficiencies, adding new products and features for customers. And as we lower costs, we pass those along to customers, either through new rates or new deals that we have. So I would say that I would look back on the performance in 2018 and say that that was great work with a - on a lot of efficiency as we also banked a lot of capacity that had been built previously. Moving forward, that's why I say it will be increasing as we move through the year. And that will be a constant battle between, again, growth, geographic expansion in AWS and also efficiencies to limit how much we actually need. I think we're also getting much better at adding capacity faster, so there's less need to build it 6 to 12 months in advance, I would say. Although, we did just launched our Hong Kong region today as well and I want to point that out. The business in China is going really well and we continue to see strong growth there. And, launching the Hong Kong region gets us to a footprint of 19 cities in China. So it continues to be a really good story for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. You are now live.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I'll go to a new topic, one-day shipping. So Amazon, the first principle is customer obsession. And, Brian, you talked about record Prime sub-growth last year. I guess the question is what are the signals or the key strategic rationale behind investing in one-day? Are there certain types of users, demographics of users, categories of products, countries you think this will help you attract and retain? It seems like Prime is growing pretty well. Just talk us through what you see as the big opportunity to invest in one-day? And then the second one, just maybe talk to us a little bit about the early learnings on the healthcare industry side of potentially trying to move larger into healthcare? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Great. Yeah, Brian, I would say it's as simple as price selection and convenience, which is the mantra that we talk about quite often. By going to one-day, it increases the convenience and it increases the available selection into the consideration set. Although, we have many items that are available in one to two hours, and also same day, the vast majority of our selection is available to you in two days. If we get that to one-day, we literally cut it in half, that's tough math for you. I'm sorry to do that. But the - we think that that will open up a lot of potential purchases that - and it will open up convenience to those customers. So we've been experimenting on a lot of different formats as you know, two-day, one-day, same-day, two-hour, stores, there's all types of - points of being there for the customer, when they need us at different points in their consideration set. So we really think it's going to be groundbreaking for Prime customers. And we're very excited to add this capability. And, again, part of this is we have the capability, because we've been at this for over 20 years and continue to invest in our fulfillment capacity, our logistics capacity and also fine-tune it. But I thank you for your question.\nDave Fildes: Yeah, Brian, and this is Dave. Just briefly on healthcare, I mean, that term can touch upon any number of different parts of our businesses. Of course, we've talked in the past about how Amazon Business serves many other companies, including the healthcare industry and providing them some great selection. And fast delivery is part of that - the business program there. So - and that continues to do well and it's a focus of Amazon Business amongst other verticals there that they serve. PillPack, we're probably around 6 months or so in since that acquisition closed, and continuing to support them in their mission and learn from them certainly. So no real update on that, but excited about the potential there to be sure. Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}], "2021": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2021-02-02 23:25:41", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, February 2, 2021 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to-date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. I realize that you may have questions about the news which we announced today in our press release, but I would like to begin with some comments on Q4 results, and then we can proceed to your questions. First, I\u2019d like to start by thanking the nearly 1.3 million Amazon employees who have risen to the challenge of serving customers around the world during this pandemic. We are proud that more than 500,000 people chose to take new jobs at Amazon in 2020. We are committed to providing all employees with great jobs, including $15 an hour starting pay in the U.S., health insurance, 401(k) matching, leading parental benefits, and upskilling opportunities. We remain focused on the safety of our employees and delivery partners, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations in stores as well as the customers shopping in our Whole Foods Market and other stores. Our Q4 results include approximately $4 billion in COVID-related operating costs, including additional employee pay during the holidays. We continue to see productivity headwinds from physical separation and training of new employees and of course investments in PPE for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities. This Q4 spend brings our total COVID-related costs for the year to more than $11.5 billion. Our teams worked hard in 2020 to ramp up in-house COVID-19 testing capabilities that are incremental to those already available to the general public. More than 700 employees are now being tested every hour, and globally we have built hundreds of COVID-19 testing sites in two labs. We are encouraging essential employees working at Amazon fulfillment centers, AWS data centers, and Whole Food Market stores across the country to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the earliest appropriate time. We are also working at the federal and state levels to support the vaccinations of frontline employees and those in the community who are providing essential services throughout the pandemic, including enabling pop up clinics in Washington State and Florida with more on the way. Now some comments on Q4 results. Our fourth-quarter holiday season has always been the busiest time of our year. This year presented additional challenges for our teams as we work to meet strong customer demand, while simultaneously growing our operations\u2019 footprint and welcoming far more new employees than any prior Q4. We welcomed nearly 175,000 new full and part-time employees in Q4 alone. This compares with 50,000 in Q4 of 2019. We also continue to add buildings in our fulfillment and logistics network with square footage growing about 50% year-over-year in 2020. And unlike in a typical year when new buildings are mostly in place by the end of Q3, this year a significant number of them came online in Q4 as our teams pulled out all the stops to be ready for customer demand, and it turns out we needed that capacity in order to fill the strong customer demand in Q4. Revenue for the quarter was $125.6 billion versus our guidance range of $112 billion to $121 billion. You will remember that we kicked off the holiday season early for customers with Prime Day in October versus its usual timing in Q3. We then saw strong seasonal holiday demand through Q4. Our Q4 results also largely reflect the continuation of demand trends we have seen since the early months of the pandemic, particularly as people are staying at home, including for household staples and other home products. We saw sales growth across our major product categories, led by strong Prime member engagement. Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. Prime members also continue to expand their usage of Prime\u2019s digital benefits including Prime Video and Prime Video channels. Amazon Music launched podcast in September and in Q4, Prime members listened to millions of hours of podcasts each month. We\u2019re reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. In Q4, we had another strong quarter that largely reflects the continuation of demand trends from Q3. We saw strong growth in new Prime member sign-ups. As demand remained strong in the quarter, the additional volume leverage helped to achieve higher-than-expected profits. We saw strong order volumes throughout the holiday season with good sales growth not only in our peak sales days, which include Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, but also throughout the remainder of the quarter. We had good operational performance within our fulfillment centers and transportation network even as we added significant capacity. Third-party sellers also stepped up as never before to serve customers. The 2020 holiday season was the best ever for small and medium-sized businesses selling in our store, with our worldwide sales growing over 50% year-over-year in Q4. Third-party units represented 55% of total paid units during the quarter, the highest 3P unit mix we\u2019ve ever had since we invited businesses to sell on Amazon more than 20 years ago. Lastly, AWS\u2019 efforts were headlined by our Ninth Annual re:Invent Conference. This is the first time in our history that the event was virtual and free. We had over 570,000 registered attendees during the three-weeks-long event. AWS continues to innovate at a rapid clip, announcing more than 180 new services and features at re:Invent across compute, storage, database, machine learning, and more. You can read more about this in our earnings release. The team also announced significant customer momentum with new commitments and migrations from JPMorgan Chase, Thomson Reuters, ViacomCBS, and Twitter just to name a few. We continue to see companies meaningfully growing their plans to move to AWS. In Q4, AWS saw continuation of strong usage and revenue growth. AWS added more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in any quarter in its history and is now a $51 billion annualized run-rate business supporting millions of active AWS customers. And just as they have all year, sellers, partners, and employees across Amazon stepped up to deliver on unprecedented customer demand, and for this we remain extremely grateful. And today, we announced that our Founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos will transition to the role of Executive Chair in the third quarter this year and that Andy Jassy will become Chief Executive Officer at that time. Those of us who know Andy are excited to see him take on this greater responsibility. He is a visionary leader, a great operator, and he understands what makes Amazon such a special innovative company. We are also excited that Jeff will retain a very important role at the company that he founded and has guided for over 25 years. He has created a culture of invention and innovation that drives us every day, and we remain bound by our common focus and obsession on the customer. With that, let\u2019s move on to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to dig a bit deeper into the incredible acceleration that we saw in the international business, obviously, pandemic aside, wondering if you could help us sort of break down the pieces of what drove that into specific regions, specific initiatives that drove that level of acceleration? And then just on the AWS business, bit more of a housekeeping question, would you mind going through just where the backlog stands and any material drivers of changes in the that to the extent there has been any?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Thank you, Heath. I would start on international segment results. So yes, it was sequential growth jump from 33% in Q3 to 50% in Q4. Part of that is the timing of Prime Day, but in the U.S. it was less pronounced, sequential growth was 39% to 40% in the North America segment. So, there was something else going on in international in Q4. I would attribute it really to the government actions and lockdowns that we saw, especially in the UK and Europe. I think that increased during the quarter unfortunately for the economy, but it did drive higher sales on our site. We also saw probably a larger impact of moving Prime Day from Q3 to Q4 in international just because it\u2019s a little more nascent there, it\u2019s still ramping up but very strong performance.\nDave Fildes: Yes, Heath, this is Dave. On the backlog number, it\u2019s at about $50 billion at the end of the year, the balance and that\u2019s up about 68% year-over-year. So that\u2019s one component of all the great work that AWS is doing, and of course you are seeing some continued very strong growth, strong usage and revenue growth there, $51 billion annualized run-rate business. So, it\u2019s continuing to grow at a meaningfully larger absolute dollar rate than others out there, and we are really pleased with the growth we are seeing in there. It\u2019s as Brian touched on at the opening, just a lot of good engagement and innovation coming out of the re:Invent conference as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Just following up on some of the comments you made between the release and in your opening comments, Brian, wanted to know if we could tease out how we should be thinking about the level of investments that are needed between the mix of fulfillment versus where you want to go on the customer service side and the logistics and delivery side as you look up to \u201821. And obviously, it\u2019s going to be a very different year in \u201821 than what we saw in \u201820, where you saw a surge in demand and a lot of capacity constraints that have opened up as the year goes on. And there will be sort of tougher comp dynamics as you get into the middle of \u201821 as you are lapping against that demand impact in \u201821? How do we think about the levels of investment you will make, where those investments are going to go, and what that means for sort of confidence on the demand side over the medium to long-term? Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Eric. Obviously, we had a large investment last year, crew fulfillment capacity, including transportation 50% year-over-year. I would say that \u2013 and it\u2019s been, I believe it\u2019s $44 billion on CapEx, yes. We are still working through our plans for 2021. I think the added complexity here is the range of outcomes certainly was the case in 2020, but even for 2021, there is a lot of question as to the continuation of COVID conditions comping against prior year sales, sometimes there are things in there that definitely wouldn\u2019t repeat probably the number of gloves we sold and hand lights [ph] and things like that or computer monitors that people setup their home offices. But there is also a lot of people who engage more strongly with Prime benefits in 2020, and we think that will have a lasting impact both from purchase frequency, amount they purchased, use of digital benefits, etcetera. So, we are going to have to build probably for multiple scenarios, and in this FC [ph] world, it\u2019s hard to turn that capacity on quickly. So, it generally means you may have to overbuild to protect the customer experience. On transportation, we made large investments in our transportation network in 2020. That work is not done yet. We have a lot of continued expansion. So, we see that over definitely through 2021. I can\u2019t quantify it right now only \u2013 I am only giving guidance through Q1 right now, and we are still working some -- through some of the plans as we do this time of the year. And then infrastructure will remain a healthy part of our investment as well. We are supporting an AWS business that is growing at a rapid clip both in usage and in revenue. We are expanding regions globally and have a lot of upside in that area talking with customers on their transition plans to the cloud. So, we definitely do not want to run out of capacity, and we work to not do that. So, there could be a risk of forward spend in 2021 due to the uncertainty, but we will see as we move through the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug, your line is open. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Anmuth: Sorry, I was muted. Brian, hoping you could talk more about the importance of AMZL Amazon Logistics during the holiday season. If you could talk more about percentage of packages perhaps shipped from your fulfillment centers and then where this can go in coming years? And then also a quick comment on the COVID costs, you mentioned $2 billion in 1Q, just curious how you think about it more on a full year basis with some of the puts and takes can be there? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. So yes, for the full year, we are again $11.5 billion was our gross cost for 2020, $4 billion of that in Q4. We see a step down to closer to $2 billion in Q1 that compares with a $600 million spend last Q1 as the pandemic just started and we started to react in March. And obviously, this cost escalated in Q2 and Q3. So, if we look at the core components of that, right, there is productivity that \u2013 productivity drags from hiring so many new employees and also having physical separation. That gets better all the time. It was exasperated a bit in Q4, because of all the new hires that we brought on over 170,000 new people that should moderate. That\u2019s why one of the reasons that we see a step down in Q1 versus Q4, it\u2019s volume-related and also mix of employees. After that, we are going to have to see again hopefully the vaccine gets going, everyone gets vaccinated and we return to normalcy. That would be very helpful on a lot fronts for everybody. And if not there will be continuation of some of these costs. I will say that, while we are very transparent or try to be on the costs that we are seeing, specifically around COVID, there are some positive things happening as that counteract a bit of that and not the least of which is the top line volume in 2020, we grew 37% on an FX neutral basis versus growing 22% in 2019. And the fact that we have been running pretty full out since arguably April, but definitely it\u2019s May, has created operating efficiencies of its own that counterbalance the physical separation and the training of new employees. So there is a lot of moving parts in here. We are able to save about $1 billion in transportation costs this year \u2013 excuse me in 2020 as for universally, all travel was shutdown and our sales teams found new ways to reach customers. We will see how that develops over time. Marketing, although it got back to probably more healthy levels in Q3 and Q4 definitely was lower in Q2 as we work through some capacity issues and it wasn\u2019t fruitful to invest in marketing when you are having trouble hitting existing customer demand. So, there are a lot of moving parts that I will try and be as transparent on as I can be during the quarter and this again Q1 is we are seeing about $2 billion of absolute COVID costs. And Dave can take the AMZL question.\nDave Fildes: Yes. Just as we talk about AMZL, Amazon Logistics, right, that\u2019s where you think about that in terms of facilities, it\u2019s a lot of the middle mile and the last mile elements that are under our management and control. And so you are talking about centers at the middle mile delivery station to the last mile. We have talked on a square footage basis 2020 was a big build year for us. Our footprint grew around 50%, about half of that incremental square footage fit into that sort of AMZL transportation side of the equation, which is a higher mix than what you have seen of any incremental adds in a year. It\u2019s higher mix being 50:50 than what you see from us in the past. So, a lot of focus on that there both because of the desire to pre-pandemic increase the one day delivery capabilities for Prime members. That also as we have moved through this year, it gives us a little bit more or much more certainty on being able to get items from point A to point B. So we finished here where now more than half our packages, both U.S. and worldwide are handled through AMZL and a lot of work going into that. And so, we will look to expand and continue to build on that with our AMZL offerings. But as we have said in the past, our delivery partners, independent delivery partners that are out there, the USPS is certainly oversees carriers as well, are an important part of that and they will continue to help us scale that up and build up that offering and make it better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Blackledge: Great. Thank you. Two questions. First, the other revenue line saw significant acceleration in 4Q, just curious if you can talk about or provide some further color on the advertiser demand that you saw in the fourth quarter? And then secondly on grocery was a big driver for Amazon in 2020 just general thoughts on grocery and I think you mentioned in the release, 7 communities rolled out Amazon Fresh grocery stores, how are they performing and should we expect a broader rollout?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, John. Let me start with the other revenue question. Yes, we saw strength in other revenue grew 64% in Q4 versus 49% in Q3 and 41% in Q2 that is primarily advertising. That\u2019s the majority of it. I would say that there has been a recovery, in advertising spend as the year progressed. The fact that we moved Prime Day into Q4 has an impact here, because again it carries a lot of clicks and eyeballs into Q4 for this time period. But I want to highlight a lot of great work being done by the advertising team. Their main principle is to help sellers, vendors, authors, publishers and partners use our tools, navigate them as fluidly as possible, and add value both for them and for our customers \u2013 and customers and get to see and find and discover new and different products. There is some things that are adding to the efficiency of advertising. We are now using a deep learning model to show more relevant sponsored products and had success with that. We are improving the relevancy of ads shown on the product detail pages all the time. And we have seen rapid adoption of video creative format for sponsored brands. All these things help checkup the conversion and the productivity of the advertising both for the seller or vendor involved and also for Amazon and makes it more productive experience with the customer as well.\nDave Fildes: John, on the grocery point, yes, we have got a couple of different formats, I think there is the Go Grocery has a couple of locations open and off to a good start, lot of interest in those and the technology that those offer as well as the Amazon Fresh locations. So we are at about 8 locations open and I think in the neighborhood of about half dozen locations are confirmed at open, so more to come on those. There is other kind of tangents of footprints on that, the Go stores, there is around 25 of those that are out there and that also important part of that is food. So, you see us it\u2019s we have talked about this a bit in the past is we are doing that with online grocery and branching out from Whole Foods and some of the other physical footprint locations and being able to offer that convenience, but we also think that being able to offer some innovative physical store grocery offerings like these Go and Fresh, some of which have some pretty cool self-checkout capabilities and implement some of the Just Walk Out technology qualities are really some interesting areas that are resonating with customers. I think they appreciate that not just in times of maybe not wanting to have physical contact with everyone in the store, but just even beyond that, the general convenience of being able to move throughout the store and check out more efficiently than you otherwise would in a traditional retail environment, so excited to do more on that front.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, I would be curious to hear about any of the learnings you had from the strength of the international business in 2020 and how you think about the right types of investments to make in that business in \u201821 and beyond to ensure you retain as many of these users and wallets as you\u2019ve gained throughout 2020? And the second one understanding the comments, Brian, earlier about sort of investments going forward, maybe just talk to us a little bit about one-day. Are these investments you are making, could they get you back to a one-day product in later part this year or in \u201822 when the world normalizes or are these assets you are putting in place now not able to be deployed from a one day perspective when overall e-commerce slows down a little bit?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Brian. Let me start with your international question. I think the biggest learning is that if we can move 2021 volume into 2020, it creates good leverage for us and it\u2019s kind of what we saw. There was essentially a doubling of the growth rate versus probably the going in time \u2013 rate for 2020. Now again, that was a very hard volume because of the COVID restrictions and issues with our workforce, keeping our workforce safe and everything else, but I think what you saw was some very high leverage on that model that overcame some of the more fixed costs that we\u2019re seeing in the Prime benefits. So we pre-invested, as we have discussed in the past, in things like video and devices and other elements of the Prime offering, now grocery, you\u2019re starting to see. And we have added those Prime benefits ahead of probably the curve that you would have seen in North America. So that has always created a bit of a drag on operating income, that as well as investments in new geographies, the investment in India, the investment that we\u2019ve made over the last two or three years that are in places like the Middle East, Turkey, Brazil, Australia, most recently, Sweden and the Netherlands in 2020. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in the international segment. But you\u2019re starting to see the benefit of the higher volumes and with it, higher advertising as well that we expected and we expect over-time. And we\u2019ll see the growth rate is going to have the same challenges year-over-year that perhaps we\u2019ll see in North America we\u2019re going to have a race between lapping things that may have been one-time in nature in 2020 versus accelerating Prime membership and Prime members\u2019 purchases, purchase frequency and adoption of digital benefits. So we will see what that looks like in 2021, very happy with the performance in 2020 and really hats off to the teams in many countries around the world who are all dealing with the same issues that we were in North America.\nDave Fildes: And I know this is a bit of an offshoot, but I just think it\u2019s worth mentioning it fits in the AWS business, but we\u2019re continuing to see strong growth from AWS around the world as well. And there is a number of international located customers out there like MercadoLibre and Zalando and others that we\u2019ve listed in there that are great customers for us. So we\u2019re working on that and really looking to support that just globally. And I mentioned this before, but re:Invent, it was a great way to bring a lot of those folks from around the world together virtually and free. And typically, we\u2019ve recorded the revenue for re:Invent from ticket sales and sponsorships. If you account for this COVID anomaly this year of it being virtual and free, AWS year-over-year revenue growth, if you look at it, actually accelerated adjusting for that from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So a lot of fun innovation, good innovation coming out of that event that we\u2019re excited to talk more with customers about.\nBrian Olsavsky: And then your question on one-day, I believe it was whether our investments will be consistent with establishing higher and higher levels of one-day. Yes, definitely. And we\u2019ve been doing that throughout the year and it\u2019s been getting better. In fact, we had a lot of examples of deliveries right up to the last minute on December 24 in the United States for holiday gifts. So the one-day has been getting better, and it\u2019s \u2013 the issues in 2020 was essentially around capacity and volume and getting things at the door and being able to then hit a shortened time period. So it wasn\u2019t that we were delaying or slowing down the shipment itself, it was the time taken to get through the warehouse and handle backlog of demand. So as the year progressed, we did see that get better and better. We do forecast that it will get better. I\u2019m not quantifying this for you. I realize that. But I think you can generally notice wherever you\u2019re particularly are, whatever geography you are, some cities are back probably to one-day levels that they saw or even better pre-pandemic. Other areas that may have other dynamic issues are still working their way out of backlogs and volume issues. But when the dust settles and as we open up more and more capacity, you\u2019ll see greater and greater one-day percentages for our Prime shipments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post: Alright, thank you. A couple. First, obviously, the Jeff Bezos announcement is quite important. I think Jeff Wilke is also retiring. Can you talk a little bit if you expect any changes to Amazon, how we should think about that? And then maybe Dave Clark is taking over retail. Talk a little bit about that. And then secondly, obviously, the backlog is really strong in AWS, up 68%. The margins did come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter to 28%. Can you talk about the deals, how pricing is in the cloud segment? Is it remaining robust and any reason the margins came down a little bit quarter-over-quarter? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Justin. Let me start with your comments on the CEO transition and then the Consumer CEO transition. I think they\u2019re both examples of what are highly effective succession planning processes at Amazon. The Board of Directors obviously takes that very seriously. It is an annual discussion and probably more often on succession plans, development of key executives, expanding the number of key executives, etcetera. And you see the byproduct of that as we expand the S team as we, 5 years ago, set up the two-CEO structure where Jeff Wilke was CEO of Consumer and Andy Jassy was CEO of AWS. We have strong single-thread leaders on devices, Amazon or \u2013 Video, including Amazon Studios, Advertising. So I think there\u2019s a lot of bench strength within Amazon and generally, we do try and push the decisions down in the organization as we scale, especially internationally as we try and do things consistently globally, but recognize local differences in our model. So having said all that, succession planning is super important. The example you saw with Jeff Wilke, Jeff announced in the fall that he was stepping down to pursue some other goals and interest that he has outside of Amazon. He had been here over 20 years, had been super pivotal in our development of our consumer business, our culture, the development of layers and layers of leaders. And one of them was Dave Clark, who has, over the last 5 plus years, really been charged with developing some very fundamental things for our Company, the expansion of the fulfillment center network, the expansion and creation of our transportation capacity, grocery delivery and the grocery plan, a lot of other things. But Dave had been great leader in his own right. So when Dave \u2013 or, excuse me, when Jeff Wilke decided to retire in the fall, it was a natural transition to Dave Clark. And that just occurred in January, and they\u2019re wrapping things up in the next month. So that\u2019s a successful example of succession planning and a successful transition. Same thing for Jeff Bezos\u2019 role and I will reiterate that Jeff is not leaving. He is getting a new job. He\u2019s going to be Executive Chair of the Board, super important role. The Board is super active and important in Amazon\u2019s success story. And Andy has been here since 1997. He is not only a visionary leader. He is a strong operator as I said and he has got a great track record of developing multiple things and businesses within Amazon, not the least of which is AWS, which is arguably the most profitable, important technology company in the world. So that\u2019s just a flavor on the insight on how it works. We\u2019re very happy to see both Jeff and Andy get new perspectives. So Andy has a chance to put his imprint on Amazon. He is certainly going to carry through the culture and the vision and the invention factory that Amazon is and will take that to the next level. Jeff will be the Executive Chairman of the Board. He will be involved in many large one-way-door issues, as we say, one-way doors, meaning the more important decisions, things like acquisitions, things like strategies and going into grocery and other things. So Jeff\u2019s always been involved with that, and that\u2019s where we will keep his time focused on \u2013 or he will keep his time focused on in his new role, so very excited all around to see the ability to have a strong transition to Andy in Q3. We will be working on backfilling the AWS role and we will talk more about that in the future, but for now, today is about Andy and Jeff Bezos.\nDave Fildes: And Justin, just on your AWS point, I mean, like I\u2019ve mentioned before, AWS growth rate is strong. The factors we\u2019ve talked about in the past continue to be in play. We\u2019re improving infrastructure planning to meet the capacity needs, given the growth we\u2019re seeing. More broadly, our results reflect that balance between the investing, the price reductions, driving cost efficiencies and the margins are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on those factors to the extent we are investing in new regions and some other elements. A few discrete things that aren\u2019t probably new but just to call out, the driver of the reduced impact from the change in the useful life of the servers. As you recall, we amended the server useful life at the beginning of the year from 3 to 4 years, and so we saw some benefit to the AWS margins and the broader margins in total. When we look at that, the impact does diminish throughout this year. So when we increased it beginning in January, the benefit from this change in Q4 was about $538 million. That\u2019s down from $634 million in Q3. So that gives you some sense of it\u2019s coming down. That\u2019s the total amount that\u2019s allocated amongst the segments, but the majority of those figures I just gave do relate to AWS because significance of the server assets going to that segment. And again, that impact\u2019s going to continue to taper down over time for example into Q1 of 2021. One other element is just FX impact. That\u2019s always going to hit us to some degree, but AWS customer billings are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. The cost, though, if you think about it, many of the costs are going to be for build-out in local currency for data centers and the people that work there and power and what have you, so there\u2019s a bit of a foreign exchange difference there. And that happens to be this time around a little bit bigger. We saw an unfavorable impact of about $96 million to the AWS margin this time around for FX, so just another point to call out there. You mentioned the backlog, too. Look, I think that\u2019s one data point amongst many as you look at AWS, but I think we\u2019re really encouraged by just general large enterprise business adoption is continuing to do well as they are choosing AWS as a tech provider and speeding up innovations. You saw a long list of the many companies that we have announced arrangements within the past 90 days, so really excited to continue to build onto that.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Yes, just going back to the topic of shipping cost inflation. This is one of the few lines that\u2019s kind of variable and kind of increasing a little bit faster than the other fixed costs. And Dave, you mentioned that over half the orders are now going through Amazon Logistics worldwide. When do you expect that rate of inflation per order to level out a little bit because of these efforts? And if you look at the cost curve in places like the UK where \u2013 or in London, where you have well over half on your own last-mile delivery, are you starting to see leverage there? Any comments on that? And thanks a lot.\nDave Fildes: Yes. On that \u2013 this is Dave. I think it\u2019s not \u2013 I won\u2019t give a forward kind of guidance mix or what that levels-off like. Some of the step-up in costs and disparity or the bigger gap, I should say, versus the unit growth rates that you\u2019re seeing there, there\u2019s a few factors. But I think this is Q4. We did add on a lot of new capacity as I said. It came on later in the year into Q4. More of it was in kind of that transportation arm and so the costs associated with that would be going to that trans cost piece. So that\u2019s one of the factors, along with the fact that we\u2019re continuing to try where we can to focus on improving one-day. And that varies region to region with all the kind of challenges of COVID that have gone on this year. But that\u2019s a goal of ours, is to get back to where we were in terms of one-day unit mix and continue to build onto that. So that\u2019ll be something to keep an eye on as we move into 2021.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions.

Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by extending a big thank you to all the folks who worked hard to make this year's Prime Day a great success, not only for our more than 150 million Prime members around the world. But also for the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who sell on our Amazon store many of whom are facing their own challenges during this pandemic. These businesses thrived on Prime Day. With third-party sellers recognizing more than $3.5 billion in sales over the two-day global event, that's 60% increase compared to Prime Day last year. I also want to thank and recognize the contributions of more than one million Amazon employees and delivery partners who are continuing to work hard to serve our customers all around the world, who will continue to spend what it takes to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. Now let me share some highlights from the quarter. Our Q3 results largely reflect a continuation of demand trends we saw when we exited the second quarter. The strong demand in sales growth across our major product categories globally including hardlines, consumables, softlines and media. We also continue to see strong Prime member engagement. Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. They continue to expand their usage of Prime's digital benefits including Prime video. Internationally, the number of Prime members who stream Prime video grew by more than 80% year-over-year in the third quarter and international customers more than doubled the hours of content they watched on Prime video compared to last year. We're also reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. In Q3, our year-over-year growth rate of online grocery sales continued to accelerate and we continue to offer more convenient options for customers including grocery pick up which is now available from all Whole Foods Market stores. And just as we saw in Q2, Prime member renewal rates improved in Q3 year-over-year. 3P sellers who as I mentioned are largely comprised of small and medium sized business continue to be important part of our offering to customers. Our 3P sellers services revenue continue to grow faster than online stores revenue. With particularly strong growth this quarter in FBA, as we return to similar mix of FBA as a percentage of total 3P units as we've seen prior to COVID. 3P units continue to represent over half of overall unit volume increasing to 54% of the total unit mix in Q3. We're investing heavily to support sellers and are pleased to report that over half a million sellers are seeing record sales in our stores this year. We continue to focus on stepped up employees safety particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations. To help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners as well as the employees and customers shopping at our Whole Foods Market and other stores. This of course has added incremental cost to our P&L. The largest portion of these costs relate to continue productivity headwinds in our facilities including process revisions to allow for social distancing and incremental cost to ramp up new facilities and the large influx of new employees hired to support strong customer demand. This also includes investments in PPE for employees and enhanced cleaning of our facilities. In total, we've incurred more than $7.5 billion in incremental COVID related costs in the first three quarters of 2020 and we expect to incur approximately $4 billion in Q4. Our consolidated revenue and operating income exceeded the top end of our guidance range. As demand remains strong in the quarter the extra volume and operating leverage helped us to achieve higher than expected profitability. And we saw another strong quarter of revenue growth in operating income performance in AWS and advertising. We had good leverage with our fulfillment centers as well as in Amazon logistics, our transportation network despite the higher COVID related cost that I mentioned. Although we had strong growth in our network in Q3 some of our fulfillment network expansion shifted out a few weeks thought it happened in Q4 rather than Q3. Once new buildings open, their short-term headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak. More of this headwind will be felt in Q4 rather than in Q3 and this is reflected in our Q4 guidance. We were able to meet the heightened demand in Q3 because we opened up more network capacity particularly in our transportation network. I pointed two important drivers of this. First, we hired a lot more people to support the strong customer demand. We welcomed 250,000 permanent full time and part time employees just in Q3 and have already added about 100,000 more in the first month of Q4. I will note that these are permanent jobs with industry leading pay including Amazon's $15 minimum wage and great benefits such as health insurance, 401(k) plan and parental leave. Secondly, this has been a big year for capital investments. We've invested nearly $30 billion in CapEx and finance leases through the first nine months of 2020 including over $12 billion in Q3. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow our fulfillment and logistics network square footage by approximately 50% this year which includes significant additions to our fulfillment centers as well as our transportation facilities. Majority of these buildings open in late Q3 and into Q4. About half of this square footage growth will be on the transportation side to be opening more sort centers and delivery stations. And finally, in AWS customer usage remained strong. We continue to see companies meaningfully growing their plans to move to AWS. While we're busy gearing up for our Annual re:Invent Conference. This year reinvent will be a free three-week virtual conference running from November 30th through December 18th. We're extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon who have delivered on unprecedented demand for several months now as well as a strong Prime Day in October. We're ready to go and looking forward to meeting the needs of our customers this holiday season. With that, let's move onto Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I've two Brian. The first one you mentioned the fulfillment center saw good leverage in the quarter. Can you just talk to us about some of the qualitative drivers of this improvement you're seeing in fulfillment cost per fulfilled unit in the quarter and sort of year-to-date and how to think about the durability of that overtime? And then secondly, I think throughout the summer Amazon logistics launched the third-party delivery service in the UK. I'm curious just to hear about early learnings from that product and how you think about scaling that to other countries and maybe globally? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Brian. Thanks for your question. Yes, the fulfillment center cost is going to be a blend of part of the COVID related cost that I mentioned in and itemized. Offset by some really strong leverage, I would say that we've been running very consistently high levels really since all of our employees came back in the first or second week of May and some of them been on unpaid leave. So that demand is very consistent and strong and has created a lot of favorable leverage because again the order pattern being high and consistent as leveraging our fixed cost assets. Things like our delivery routes are more dense at high volumes. So we see even transportation some increased efficiencies. Offsetting that again is productivity elements that we've articulated things like social distancing, extended breaks. Other steps we're taking to keep people safe and distanced in our facilities, in our delivery network.\nDave Fildes: And this is Dave, I don't have much to share I think on, what we've got going on with any of [indiscernible] efforts other than I'll just say, we're always working to develop new and innovative ways to support. The companies we work with including small and medium-sized businesses we sell on Amazon and that includes testing and shipping programs that can help any of these businesses gets packages to customers quickly and reliably.\nBrian Nowak: Great, thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Brian just wanted to go back to the 4Q operating income guide. I appreciate your thoughts there. Just trying a dig a little bit deeper in terms of how you're thinking about it kind of beyond the $4 billion in COVID cost. It still feels like maybe there's some more in there that we're not thinking about perhaps beyond the square footage increases and the incremental headcount. So if you've any comments there? And just curious I know it's early on 2021, but you've obviously done a ton of investment this year and with the 50% square footage increase and you tend to cycle at times in terms of CapEx investment. Just how you think about [adjusting] [ph] that kind of build out as you go forward? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Doug. One last comment, I forgot to mention to Brian on his last question is, the fact that a lot of that heightened demand so far coming to Q2 and Q3 when we tend to have excess capacity before Q4, so that's another source of leverage especially in non-peak orders. As far as guidance is concerned again, I think there's lot of uncertainty certainly in Q4. We generally have a lot of uncertainty around the holiday things from holiday spending to what our cost to fulfill normal orders would be whether issues that can come up this year's an election year. We saw some disruption in 2016, so there's a whole host of issues that generally come to bear in Q4. I think the fact that COVID is dwarfing all of those is causing us a lot of uncertainty on our top line range. We saw continuation in Q3 of some really good trends from Q2 and we've project those into Q4. Some of the negative factors that you mentioned as foreign profitability is again. We'll see more of the brunt of the capital investment and the people investment. We had a lot of people in the last quarter and then we added another 100,000 people in October so far. So there's that, there's generally the dynamics of Prime Day because it's a deal-oriented time period that's usually not the highest margin period and that shifted into Q4. But generally, we have really because of the calendar this year we have really built our capacity included both in facilities and people and are carrying it through the entire quarter. We carried it through Prime Day and now we're carrying it through into the rest of the quarter. I think in other quarters you might have seen more gradual build up that would have occurred through October end and probably maximized in November and December. So that's what I would tell you on holiday again. We have our normal caveats, so there's a lot of uncertainty and things that could go right and wrong, so that's why we put a range around it. And I'm sorry, could you repeat your second question?\nDoug Anmuth: Just on how you think about 2021 perhaps just CapEx build out going forward given that you've really stepped up the investment in 2020?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. I think some of the investment things like grocery delivery and that capacity are things that we would have invested in over time and it being matched by higher order volume. So our intent is to continue to deliver a great grocery delivery experience for our customers. So that is a little bit of pull forward. Yes, we did expect to build out our logistics capacity a lot this year especially as we have been rolling out one-day delivery the middle of last year, that was setting us up for a big build this year. So we pull forward a bit from 2021 into this year to satisfy the demand. I think we've - the logistics team is really good at in one way you're locking up long-term commitments on space and buildings. But on the other hand being able to adjust the timeline in or out to match the capacity and demand. I think at this point we're not trying to cut it close and we're erring on the side of having too much capacity and we think that's the right call. It has been this year. We'll adjust as we get through the holiday and we'll learn a lot more. Hopefully the pandemic will be in better shape as a country and globe in Q1 of next year. It's very reactionary at this point. We've got to play the hand that we're dealt and we're trying to anticipate and keep the customer insulated from any variability. But it's challenging certainly.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for the color Brian.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post: Great, thanks. When you look at 3Q the environment, can you help us kind of understand the best you can quantify. How much of the incremental unit sales do you think are being aided by COVID or how much is it just a natural recurring shift online that could recur and continue to grow next year? Any thoughts on that? And then same type of question for the cloud? I'm guessing there's some headwinds of lower transaction volumes for some of your customers and then maybe there's more demand from the work at home environment. So if you could give us any thoughts on both the retail and cloud and how COVID is impacting it and could there be - how that will impact next year? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. It's hard to predict. I would say that there's been phases of this year. Early on there were a lot of stock ups of groceries and other household supplies followed by a wave of people buying gloves and disinfectant wipes and masks. That maybe a bit of bubble that people are not going to buy as much next year hopefully that will be a good problem to have it, as that demand went down. But otherwise we're seeing Prime number engagements. So it's strengthening our Prime program. The renewal rates are going up and the engagement is going up. So people are buying more frequently and across more categories. They're using more of our digital benefit. We like the trends on kind of connectedness to our Prime program and we think that will have lasting value. When things open up a bit more and there's more store options for people to buy from, there will be leveling of volume back to the stores I would imagine. So we think the trends are good. They've been pulled forward probably a bit from our - the adoption curves have been pulled forward from our initial - pre-COVID thinking especially on things like grocery delivery. So your second question on the cloud. Cloud is a mixed bag right now because we're very happy with the cloud performance and we're seeing a lot of customers who are now moving to the cloud at a faster pace. It accelerated their plans. There's anomalies in different industries going on this year things like travel and hospitality are down. A lot of companies are in holding pattern in middle and some are doing really well things like video conferencing, and gaming, and remote learning, and things tied to entertainment. So I would say that majority of the companies though are looking for ways to cut down on expenses. Going to cloud is a good way to cut down on expenses long-term. To trying to cut down on their short-term costs in the cloud, by tuning their workloads and we're helping them do that and doing the best we can to help them save short-term dollars and again tune their usage again some of our benchmark. We think that is good for the customer and therefore, it will be good for us long-term. But even and despite those actions with strong growth the year-over-year growth in absolute dollars this quarter were the largest we've ever seen and we feel good about the state of the business and the state of our sales force and their ability to drive value during this period. We've seen a lot of companies extending their contracts with us. The backlog of multi-year deals has gone up quite a bit. It's good from a customer connectedness standpoint. Certainly each industry is going through different dynamics right now.\nDave Fildes: And you can see, this is Dave. I'll just add to that. You can see number of those significant commitments of customers called in [indiscernible] carriers, global payments and number of others. Also seeing some good engagement with governments on their recognizing need to transform tech, get their technology more nimble and innovative. Schools and universities are planning for online learning. So a lot of help we can work with customers to provide there. On the kind of from a product perspective, we're seeing significant momentum with our AWS design Graviton2 processors. So you've got customers like SmugMug and Netflix and there's many others. But they're realizing up to 40% better price performance from the newer Amazon EC2s, the MRC T [ph] instance families. So when you compare that to x86-based instances. Those Amazon EC2 instance families are all powered by our - with our new AWS design Graviton2 processors. So really pleased with what we're seeing there in that engagement as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. Just a couple of things, how should we think about where capacity utilization of the fulfillment infrastructure is at this point with the way the growth that we've seen and the wave of new warehouse announcement? What kind of CapEx is going to be necessary to sort of bring you back to what you would consider normal levels that you'd be growing from? And then there's obviously been a lot of discussion around the capacity limitation the third-party shipping networks are going to see this holiday season given demand. How much of an issue do you see that as being and given your investments and your own delivery capacity does that become a competitive advantage for you during the holiday?\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, thanks Health. I'll start with that last one yes. [Indiscernible] intertwined here so. The third-party shipping, we rely on third-party shippers. We've great partnerships around the globe with third-party shippers and we know that their capacity will be tight as well as ours. We do feel good that we've invested quite a bit in our own capacity and you just mentioned that, about half of our CapEx is going to expanding transportation. A lot of the people that we're hiring are also focused on transportation. So we feel good that we've been able to develop that capability a lot of this year because we needed it and we're going to need it in Q4. Having said that, it's going to be tight for everyone and I think it will all be stretched and it's advantageous to the customer and probably to the companies for people to order early this year. But regardless of the order pattern we're going to do our best to get the usual excellent service to our customers. On CapEx levels, again we've grown our fulfillment and logistics infrastructure 50% this year. We'll see again what that implies for next year. We do see continued expansion and CapEx specifically in transportation area. So that will be start of probably multi-year period where we're hiring CapEx for that. But we'll see, right now we're just focused on Q4 and giving the guidance for Q4. Your question on capacity utilization. It's been very tight this year certainly we're able to fill up a lot of our any excess capacity in Q2 and Q3 that might have seasonally been excess. As we get into Q4 and everything stepping up. We're adding it and using it simultaneously. We had a really good test for Prime Day and we feel good about that performance in that work and we continue to add on top of that. Lots of excitement around the holiday. But we feel we're in good shape and ready to go.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks, two questions please. How should we think about these $4 billion expenses in the fourth quarter, $7 billion year-to-date like? Do you view them more as one-time-ish or just overall increases as you built out the network? Are they structural or one-time-ish I really want to get at that? Secondly international segments been nicely profitable or reasonably profitable for two quarters in a row. Is there some reason to think that's sustainable? And I'm sorry, third question. The other revenue growth accelerated to 49% can you give any color behind that? Thanks a lot.\nBrian Olsavsky: Hi Mark, thank you. Let me start with the COVID question. So we have again, our expenses in Q3 were estimated to be around $2.5 billion and we're seeing closer to $4 billion in Q4. The majority of that is due to the expansion of our operations. So things like productivity that. There's productivity drags for things like new hire ramp, social distancing, extending break periods, things that we can quantify, said look this is a change in our process that has hurt productivity. We also have cost related to - so those are calculated that. There's more direct cost around cleaning and supplies, testing and those are the main things I would say. So what we're trying to do by capturing these cost as to show what is, we believe is incremental and the intent is that these for our own knowledge as well that these will once the pandemic is over hopefully that soon, that these should be cost that don't recur. Okay. We know that simultaneously there's some benefits going on right now. There's things like in Q2 we had lower marketing expense you see that in our trends. It's starting to come back in Q3 and Q4 to more normalized levels but certainly everyone. There's not a lot of requirement or need to do marketing this year for parts of the year. We saved nearly $1 billion in travel this year because travel's ground to a halt, internal travel, travel on expenses. So there's things like that will resume at a later date and maybe not get to the same levels as the past. But there won't be as artificially low as this year. So we're trying to be transparent as best we can on the cost we're seeing. We're [indiscernible] netting against some of the favorability's from demand and some of the other cost that might be offsetting although they're not offsetting to the extent that they COVID costs are sitting there. And then I'll point the fact that because we're running at such a high level and at consistently high level really in off peak periods. We have been able to run these warehouses very efficiently. You have to split the discussion kind of between the cost penalty on the COVID related issues. But then there's certainly been some favorability from running assets more fallout condition. Okay, so hopefully that gives you some color on it. International segment profitability. I would say and I think we discussed this a bit last quarter. We're seeing an advancement of volume and very strong volume if you will in especially in our countries in Europe and Japan. So we maybe putting in a way future volume onto this year's cost structure. So that is probably why you're starting to see that is why you're seeing profitability in international. I would say generally we're still investing ahead of the US in a lot of dimensions internationally things like Prime benefits, things like the devices, things like international expansions. You might have seen that we just launched in Sweden yesterday. There's a lot of competing factors going on right now internationally. But I think right because of the high volumes and the leverage we're seeing and particularly in places like the UK and Germany it creating profitability ahead of schedule if you will. But we should get about the level of investment that continued and we see that we're committed to continuing that even after the pandemic and including the international segment of course is India where we've had a very strong Prime Day and Diwali is off to a good start and so anyway. The third comment was on other revenue. Yes that is essentially getting mostly advertising and we had very strong advertising performance in Q3. So continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2. We start to see advertising budgets increase from some of the contraction that had occurred earlier in Q2 and we just had a lot more traffic and we do a good job of turning that traffic into valuable real estate for our advertisers and for our customers to find out more about selection and brand discovery. So most of that is with strong quarter in advertising and that's what you're seeing in the other revenue line.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. One following up on Mark's question on the advertising side. You know we continue to see you guys innovate a lot on the product side especially with programmatic advertising, video advertising. Can you just give us a little bit of sense of how you see the advertising offering both on Amazon and off Amazon sort of evolving in the years ahead? And the second question would be coming back Brian to your comment in the opening remarks around Prime video and all the consumptions you've seen globally in the recent past. How does that help inform what do you think about in terms of the opportunity when invest against original content to continue to drive that sort of medium consumption loop within the Prime membership. Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, great. Eric I'll start off with the questions on advertising. So just to ground you and I think our main priorities here at the space and some of these probably aren't too surprising is, we're focused on making our tools easier to use. Sponsored ads, sponsored brand site, a bidding sponsored product targeting. Working on just simplifying registration for agencies and marketers, getting set up. But we're also very focused on being smarter about servicing more relevant ads to customers. Making display ads easier and then increasing usability to Amazon demand site platform. So we've been working on a number of those areas and then developing new products and a lot of that's focused around, how are we serving brands from various areas Twitch [ph] sponsored brands, stores of course, so another interesting area. We're certainly in a unique position to be able to provide measurement services that help all these brands or understand the impact of other advertising in ways they're going to help them grow their business. Video, you mentioned I think video is one that's we're working hard on with some of the OTT video advertising opportunities there. We're seeing some good momentum with that. We offer inventory and IMDB TV, ad supported space and 3P apps [indiscernible] pulling off the Fire TV. I think good momentum and a lot of good learning on some of those initiatives there. I won't say too much about what we'll look like next year in the future but that gives you kind of sense of priorities where we're spending our time and focused on.\nDave Fildes: And your question on video, so we step back in our goals to deliver high quality and fresh content to our global Prime member base. We're doing that by producing top tier US content that we show globally and then we augment that with local originals in each region. If we do that job well - we've seen it as a very significant acquisition channel from new Prime members especially in many smaller countries around the world. We see higher free trial conversion rates. Higher membership renewable rates and then higher overall engagement as I mentioned in Q3 specifically. And when they do that, when the more engaged they are, we know that, that turns into more sales on Amazon and it's a self-reinforcing loop. So we're very happy with the video performance particularly during this period. I think people have gotten really good chance to test out the content maybe Prime members [indiscernible] that benefit as much in the past, have given another look and have you know really found value in it. We're in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide and again we're seeing some really interesting localized content developing in places like India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, UK and Spain which I think the customers in those countries really appreciate.\nDave Fildes: Great, thanks for joining us today for the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-07-30 22:42:04", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, David Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDavid Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, July 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. I\u2019d like to start by thanking and recognizing the contributions of hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees and delivery partners and hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who are working hard to serve our customers all around the world in these uncertain times. Amazon\u2019s second quarter was another highly unusual quarter. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we began to see a significant increase in customer demand beginning in early March, and demand remained elevated throughout Q2. Strong early demand in groceries and consumable products continued into Q2, while demand increased during the quarter in our other major product categories like hardlines and softlines. At the same time, we continue to focus on stepped up employee safety, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations, to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. In Q2, we incurred more than $4 billion of COVID-related expenses, getting products to customers and keeping employees safe. The largest portion of these costs related to compensation for our frontline employees, including higher hourly wages through the end of May and a more than $500 million Thank You bonus in June. We also experienced productivity headwinds in our facilities. This included changes to over 150 of our processes to provide for social distancing as well as costs to onboard and train over 175,000 new employees who are hired to meet the higher customer demand. This $4 billion also included investments in personal protective equipment for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities. Our consolidated revenue and operating income significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Strong top line performance was driven by increased consumer demand, led by Prime members. We continue to see high Prime member engagement throughout the quarter. Prime members shop more often with larger basket sizes. Worldwide streaming video hours doubled year-over-year driven largely by Prime video. We\u2019re reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. Online grocery sales tripled year-over-year. Existing Prime member renewal rates improved, and the Prime member growth rate accelerated both in the U.S. and worldwide. Our 3P sellers, who are largely comprised of small and medium-sized businesses, also stepped up to help make more selection available for customers. And as a result, these small and medium-sized businesses have seen significant growth in their sales. Our third-party seller services revenue grew faster than online stores revenue in Q2, with strong growth in both fulfillment by Amazon and merchant fulfilled or MFN seller sales. Third-party units continue to represent more than half of overall unit volume, helped by improved quarter-over-quarter growth in active sellers. We are more committed than ever to supporting the success of the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products in Amazon stores. We were able to meet this heightened demand because we were also able to open up more fulfillment network capacity as the quarter progressed with faster delivery across more selection. I\u2019d point to a few capacity improvements that have allowed us to enhance throughput. First, our regular headcount grew 34% year-over-year as of the end of Q2 and continues to grow. We welcomed more than 175,000 new employees in March and April, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. As we\u2019ve seen demand remain high, we are in the process of bringing 125,000 of these employees into regular full-time positions. I would also note that Amazon has created more jobs over the last decade than any other company, and we are proud that we\u2019re continuing to create good jobs with industry-leading wages and great benefits during this challenging time. Our combined number of regular and seasonal employees is currently over 1 million. We\u2019ve also been able to expand the output in our existing facilities as we\u2019ve had time to implement, learn and iterate on the new process paths we put in place. Additionally, as a reminder, Q2 is typically our lightest volume quarter for the retail business. That\u2019s not the case this year, but what that\u2019s meant is that we can flex into space normally used for second half peak demand. This led to strong operating leverage in Q2. As we move towards peak in the second half of the year, we will ramp up our space needs even further, and we\u2019ll be adding significant fulfillment center and transportation capacity in the second half of the year. Turning to AWS. This is now a $43 billion annualized run rate business, up nearly $10 billion in run rate in the last 12 months. Customer usage remains strong, although growth varies across industries as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Lastly, I\u2019ll touch upon our Q3 guidance, which we provided as part of our earnings release. A few additional data points on this guidance. We expect to incur more than $2 billion in COVID-related expenses in Q3 to help keep employees safe, including continued investment in social distancing, PP&E and testing. Costs are expected to be lower than in Q2 primarily due to better cost efficiency at the high demand levels we are seeing. In addition, I\u2019ll remind you that the third quarter is typically when we open the majority of our new fulfillment network capacity, and we expect the same this year. We continue to invest meaningfully, including $9.4 billion in CapEx and finance leases in Q2 alone, an increase of 65% year-over-year, primarily driven by investments in our fulfillment and logistics footprint. Once these buildings open, they are a headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak. In 2019, we increased network square footage by approximately 15%. This year, we expect a meaningfully higher year-over-year square footage growth of approximately 50%. This includes strong growth in new fulfillment center space as well as sort centers and delivery stations. We expect the majority of this capacity to come online in late Q3 and into Q4. Lastly, we plan to host Prime Day in Q4 this year rather than Q3 as it has been in prior years. The one exception is Amazon India, which will host Prime Day on August 6 and August 7. In summary, we know that people are relying on online shopping more than ever during this unprecedented time, and we are working hard to add capacity to serve customers. We\u2019re extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon for continuously stepping up to meet the needs of customers. With that, let\u2019s move on to Q&A.\nOperator: At this time, we\u2019ll now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller, please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I could just dive in on the normalized trends you\u2019re seeing as you exit June and get into July. You made a push into essentials and deemphasized non-essentials, as we talked about in the last earnings call. Where are we in terms of the company getting the mix between essentials versus non-essentials right in terms of offering to customers? Where are you in terms of returning to normal on next-day and two-day shipping initiatives to drive Prime? If there was any color on the state of affairs with either of those by geo or region of the world, that would be great. Thank you so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Eric. Thanks for your question. So first, on the trend. So if you remember, we exited Q1 and spoke at the end of April. We had taken a lot of steps in March and April to, first, limit the incoming non-essential products into our warehouses, and then we reversed that or eliminated that decision in mid-April. So we started to normalize on our channel mix. And I would say, as we moved into late April and early May, we expected that because a lot of the sellers can toggle between MFN or FBA sales that we would see MFN drop as FBA picked up. But to a large extent, MFN remained strong even as FBA picked up. So we had a very favorable mix, if you will, coming from March on. It started to normalize a little bit more to normal levels towards the end of the quarter, but MFN still remains high. On the product side, a lot of what we saw in March and early April was sales of consumables and groceries and safety items. And we talked a lot about the fact that, that was coming at pretty much zero cost \u2013 or excuse me, zero profit when you factored in the COVID-related costs. We\u2019ve got better on our cost structure, and we also resumed a more normal mix in, I\u2019d say, early part of May. So since then, I would say it\u2019s getting closer to what we call a more normal mix. Demand is still super high. What we\u2019re seeing on \u2013 it\u2019s driven by Prime members and Prime member engagement. They\u2019re shopping more often. They have larger basket sizes. There\u2019s still a heavy component of grocery \u2013 online grocery sales tripled year-over-year in the quarter as we added capacity there. So well, there\u2019s shifts in the mix based on what customers want. It\u2019s looking a little more normal, and it\u2019s staying at a very high level. On one day, we realize that our first priority is to keep our employees safe, and the second is focus on getting our capacity increased. Once we\u2019ve done that, we are working very hard to get faster shipments. And we\u2019ve seen the one-day and two-day recover through the quarter, but it\u2019s still probably considerably behind the going in rate before any of this happen. So we\u2019ll continue to work on that. But again, first priority is definitely keeping employees safe, and second is increasing our capacity.\nDavid Fildes: Yes. And this is just David. I think just from a geographic perspective, Brian\u2019s opening comments there, a lot of these order trends and activity, you can see that both the North America and the International segment are growing well. So a lot of those kind of trends in category performances and first-party and third-party seller growth, whether it be merchant fulfilled or FBA sellers, we\u2019re seeing a lot of growth across the board, kind of similar-type broad trends when you think about the U.S. and North America as well as our international regions, in particular, our more established international regions.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. So two, just a quick follow-up on Eric\u2019s question. Brian, when do you think you\u2019ll get back to par in terms of one day being one day? And then secondly, these profit levels are super high now. They\u2019re becoming super high at the company if you ex out the COVID costs. Is Jeff aware of how profitable the company is becoming? Is he happy about it? And I\u2019m kind of being facetious, obviously, when I asked that. But what I also want to ask really is when you think about new investment areas, and at the top of the list, maybe some new international launches are really building out some of the markets that you\u2019ve \u2013 like India, Brazil and Mexico or the business-to-business operations, like there\u2019s a ton of new investment areas, and it seems like the Amazon historically, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same now, would be using this kind of revenue surge and really investing aggressively in these new areas. So just talk about that. I know you\u2019ve got spend on COVID, but as you think about the next three to five years, you\u2019ve got these really profit surges. How can you deploy those? Or how do you want to deploy those into some of the newer investment areas? Thanks a lot.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for your questions, Mark. First, on when we get back to par, we don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019re getting progressively better, but we\u2019re also balancing what is going to be very stepped up demand and capacity in Q3 and Q4. So if you look at our historic run rates and can see how big a quarter Q2 was, Q2 was actually higher revenue than Q4 of last year, which is unheard of. And Q3 is now forecast to be also higher than Q4 of last year. So we\u2019ve kind of moved the peak forward, and for different reasons, we\u2019re trying to, mainly, like as I said, first priority is getting \u2013 is making sure our employees are safe and that we continue to do social distancing and keep everybody safe and healthy. Second priority is getting capacity online because we do not have \u2013 in Q2, we generally have lower revenue. And in Q2, like I mentioned, we were able to use the excess capacity that did exist to serve the higher demand. Now as we move into Q3, we\u2019re starting to \u2013 we need to build the inventory more for Q4, and we\u2019ve run out of space. So we\u2019ve got our hands full on that challenge, but we\u2019ve got a really good team that\u2019s been working very hard probably since late February on this issue. And when you talk about profitability, we\u2019ll also mention that there are a couple of expenses that have gone down in the interim. Marketing, we cut marketing probably by about 1/3 in Q2 as \u2013 mainly because we\u2019re trying to manage demand. It started to normalize and get back to somewhat normal levels in \u2013 at the end of Q2, but \u2013 and therefore, we\u2019ll see a higher level in Q3. But certainly, marketing costs were lower. You probably saw it in a lot of companies. Travel expenses have almost drawn to a halt. Meeting costs, even medical costs in some examples or in some cases have been delayed as people don\u2019t go to the doctor or don\u2019t go there as quickly. We think that will normalize over time. And as far as investments, we\u2019ve got a lot of investments already in play. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of necessarily accelerating investment or \u2013 we\u2019re always looking for new investments that make sense to us. But during this time, I would say we\u2019ve actually accelerated our ops investment. We pulled in capacity that we probably didn\u2019t think would be needed until 2021, maybe later. On grocery, we\u2019ve also greatly expanded our grocery delivery capacity, and that\u2019s probably ahead of schedule.\nDavid Fildes: Yes. This is Dave. Just to add to that, I think Prime is such a big focus, and some of the growth statements that Brian talked about at the opening of the call, whether it was strength in Prime membership and the acceleration we saw in the U.S. or worldwide or some of the usage stats like the grocery momentum or the doubling of video hours, for us, it\u2019s just another encouraging sign. We think there\u2019s still a lot more value we can add to that program. And that\u2019s not just in the United States where we\u2019ve got sort of a broader set of services than some of the other regions, but really focusing on supporting in some of those other regions. And so we\u2019ve got places like Australia, the Middle East. We\u2019ve talked about India many times, but a lot of focus on building that out. I think what\u2019s great about a place \u2013 all geographies with a place like India is we\u2019re really focused on digitizing the Indian sellers. A lot of micro, small and medium-sized businesses there. We launched some new features there to help support the digitization efforts with some of those brands and just a lot of work, great work being done by that team. They have some goals there around getting more sellers on board and hiring many more people as well. So a lot of focus there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, Brian, is going back to the investments, and you\u2019re often making multiyear investments for customers and customer offerings, and you\u2019re the man behind the capital allocation plan. I guess I\u2019d be curious to hear about can you give us some examples of areas of investment that may have been pushed out this year because of shelter in place and the higher demand that you\u2019ve been seeing? So what were areas where you thought you were going to spend more at the start of the year than you actually have now in the current 2020 plan? And then the second one, the international strength, I appreciate the color on Europe and Japan. Nice to see the profitability. Maybe just talk to us sort of qualitatively about some puts and takes around your core international markets, Europe and Japan? And how to think about whether or not they could be more or less profitable than the U.S. long-term? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. I think you\u2019ll \u2013 starting with that second one. You\u2019ll notice that the International segment was profitable this quarter, and that\u2019s a great sign. It is heavily driven by the pickup in demand that we saw, as I mentioned, I believe, in multiple calls. What\u2019s going on internationally is we have some very healthy established countries that we\u2019ve been in a long time. And we have probably accelerated their adoption of Prime benefits. We\u2019ve pushed video and devices and music and other things to those countries probably earlier in the life cycle than you would have seen in the U.S. So there\u2019s a bit of a forward investment on Prime benefits in many of those countries. But what you also see are investments in new countries. Obviously, India is the biggest one, but also, to a lesser extent, the Middle East, Brazil, Turkey and Australia are recent addition. So there\u2019s always an element of expansion going on there. Advertising is growing, so that\u2019s a good source of profitability. But if you look at what happened in Q2, it was essentially just the much higher volumes than we had anticipated or had on a run rate. So our fixed costs were leveraged to the hilt. Obviously, we will add some capacity and things in transportation and fulfillment centers, but all other fixed costs were pretty much leveraged on that higher demand. The UK in particular, was very strong because there\u2019s probably more stay-at-home orders and the way the economy was developing in the UK. We had a very, very strong quarter there. So I would say that the surge in demand internationally also helped drive that profitable, maybe a little earlier than the trajectory would have shown. And I\u2019m not sure that, that is going to continue for the next couple of quarters, but it\u2019s a good sign that we could leverage that. And a lot of the same trends in the U.S. were apparent internationally, higher Prime \u2013 more frequent Prime purchases and higher basket sizes. So all good signs, and perhaps we got a glimpse of the future on the demand curve. Your second question on slowing investments. The list is very short on what we\u2019ve had to slow down. It\u2019s mostly \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been done necessarily for cost reasons, it\u2019s been done for people reasons. The one I\u2019d point to is studios. We\u2019ve had to delay production. I think most studios have. And that\u2019s been augmented by some new things like our Amazon cinema where we\u2019re having first run movies. And so I think in this time, when people want entertainment, people are having trouble creating new content across the board. And that\u2019s a bit of a challenge, but it\u2019s not something we\u2019re doing intentionally. We\u2019re doing it to protect the actors and film crews, and we think that\u2019s the right decision. As I said, a lot of the investments are being pulled in, especially on the upside and grocery delivery, same-store pickup. A number of whole food stores that you can pick up deliveries on tripled this quarter. So the list is short on things that we\u2019re slowing down on, I would say. It\u2019s just we\u2019re adapting and probably looking at whether some things have changed and creating some things for the new environment, especially in the entertainment area.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. Brian, first, just curious about your overall thoughts on how the e-commerce adoption curve has been shifted here over the next few years. And anything you can share around behavior for new and existing customers. And then separately, on AWS, the $43 billion run rate obviously slowed some in the quarter, but hoping you could comment just on the pace of IT decision-making in this environment, whether you\u2019re still impacted by some clients more highly exposed to challenged verticals? And due to those factors, is it possible that AWS can accelerate growth going forward? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Let me start with that second one. Thanks, Doug. So in the AWS segment revenue, what we see are companies are working really hard right now to cut expenses, especially in the more challenged businesses like hospitality and travel but pretty much across the board. We\u2019re helping them. We\u2019re actively, with our sales force, looking for ways that we can help them save money. This includes things like scaling down the usage where it makes sense or benchmarking their workloads against our architectural best practices. So that\u2019s not going to help our usage growth in the short run, but it will help those customers save money. And we think that\u2019s the right thing to do, not only for their success and so they can come out of this at a better shape but also for the long-term health of our relationship with them as an AWS provider. But we\u2019re also seeing a lot of companies that are really wishing that they had made more progress on the cloud because they\u2019re seeing how companies that are on the cloud can turn into a variable cost and either scale up or scale down depending on their particular situation. They realize their on-premise infrastructure is not really flexible to go up or down. And especially in the time of sinking demand, it\u2019s a big fixed cost for them. So we expect \u2013 we\u2019re seeing migration plans accelerate. They\u2019re certainly not going to happen overnight, but we see companies moving more in that direction. We think that will be a good long-term trend. And there\u2019s certainly winners in this area right now, things like video conferencing, gaming, remote learning and entertainment. All are seeing usage growth. And it\u2019s a bifurcated world out there. So the \u2013 on your e-commerce adoption, I think it\u2019s hard to tell. We\u2019re super encouraged by the fact that grocery delivery has picked up, and that\u2019s been accelerated versus what we would have thought. We certainly are glad to be there for our Prime members who are shopping more frequently and buying more. We do know that there\u2019s reasons that there are other options are limited. I mean there are always retail options out there, especially to go pick up in store, but less people want to go into stores perhaps now. So we\u2019re going to have to see what is maybe a step-up in the curve and getting to a point quicker versus what are some onetime sales and things like \u2013 hopefully, things like masks and gloves and cleaning supplies in the fullness of time become onetime purchases, but we\u2019ll see. And sorry, your last point was on new customers versus existing customers. We\u2019re seeing similar trends. We\u2019re seeing good pickup in frequency and basket size for new members in Prime as well, certainly not the same as people have been Prime members for a number of years. But it\u2019s encouraging. And as you saw, Prime growth retention has increased. We\u2019ve accelerated the number of \u2013 the growth of Prime members, both in the U.S. and internationally. So that\u2019s a good sign that we\u2019re happy about. And we hope that, that has long-term ramifications.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss Sandler: Yes. Just a follow-up to that last comment. So the Prime behavior for international Prime members, you guys have talked about how like in the 16, 17 countries, the overall service levels are a little bit behind, selection is a little bit behind. So has the last few months in the pandemic closed that gap meaningfully in terms of GMV per Prime member for international versus what you see in the U.S.? Any comment there? And then on the 3Q guidance, you pushed Prime day for western markets into 4Q. So how much of the deceleration \u2013 it\u2019s obviously a really strong number for 3Q, but the growth rate is decelerating a little bit. Is that mostly from Prime Day? Or can you just talk about what kind of behaviors you\u2019re seeing right now as you go into 3Q? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Right. Well, we ramped up through the quarter in Q2 and ended up with 41% year-over-year growth in FX-neutral \u2013 on an FX-neutral basis. A lot of those trends are continuing into Q3. You see our revenue range is $87 billion to $93 billion coming off of $89 billion quarter. So I would say that the \u2013 if you look at the growth rate, that translates into somewhere in the 24% to 33% growth rate in Q3. So I can\u2019t break out exactly the Prime impact because there\u2019s \u2013 but suffice to say, it\u2019s a big driver on why 41% growth in Q2 turns into 24% to 33% growth in Q3 on what turns out to be higher revenue volume. And then on Prime behavior, it\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t really give you more on that because it is actually a very localized set of staff by country. In international, aggregate does not matter that much. And what I would say is, generally, what we\u2019re seeing is similar trends in international in response to COVID purchasing patterns. I wouldn\u2019t say it closed the gap. I said \u2013 I would say they both went up. And we\u2019ll see how it goes from there. I think there\u2019s definitely any differences in selection or differences in shipping. There\u2019s a myriad of factors that go into a Prime member\u2019s decision to be a Prime member and to what they buy and what they use as far as our benefits that we give them. So I don\u2019t want to make too many sweeping comments on that right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, good afternoon. I was curious if you could just expand on AWS. There was a little bit of a slowdown across the board and a number of the cloud numbers. I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s a common trend that you\u2019re seeing there. And perhaps just talk about the backlog. I know you\u2019ve disclosed the backlog has been improving in the filings, but a little more color on AWS would be certainly helpful. Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. I\u2019ll give you the backlog number. It grew 65% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter. So that\u2019s healthy, and we have the average contract length is over three years for our AWS contracts. I would say contract volume and negotiations are strong and have maintained through this period. So it is \u2013 that\u2019s a good sign. It really does boil down to short-term versus long-term incentives here for a lot of our customers. They\u2019re \u2013 if you\u2019re in an industry that\u2019s been heavily impacted by COVID in the economy, you\u2019re looking for ways to save money and you\u2019re trying to do a click and we\u2019re trying to help in that regard. And one of the best ways to save money long-term is to use the cloud, not only to turn it into a variable cost, it could be a fixed cost, but also to be able to take advantage of the partner network that we have, the security that we have and also the constant evolution of products and services that we bring to market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nAaron Kessler: Great. A couple of questions. First, maybe just one of your competitors noted that growth was slowing in some markets that have opened up, I guess, probably more in Europe. Maybe just thoughts there. Are you seeing any changes in sort of the markets that are starting to open up? And just any commentary on the Zoox acquisition, how you kind of \u2013 can use that technology longer term as well? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: I imagine you mean on consumer business, countries opening up.\nAaron Kessler: Correct.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Well, we still see strong demand. So I don\u2019t have any particular color on that regard by country. We do think probably the UK was very \u2013 grew very strongly in Q2, and that, I believe, is starting to moderate a bit but still stronger than normal. So I don\u2019t want to go by country, but I think those trends will start to perhaps become evident. But the \u2013 from our vantage point, the Prime members still continue to order more frequently and in larger basket sizes.\nDavid Fildes: Yes. And then, Aaron, just on your second question on Zoox, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s not too much to say at this point. It\u2019s still pretty early, but I think it probably goes without saying it\u2019s a tremendously forward-thinking team, which resonates with us. And they really do kind of pioneer in that space, the ride-hailing space. So a lot of cool work they\u2019re doing, designing autonomous vehicles and focused on the passenger, right, in front of mind in that. So I think, again, just as we think about kind of the innovation components and commitments to solving kind of problems and challenges for customers, it\u2019s pretty exciting for us to be able to work with them and bring that vision to fruition in the years ahead.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post: Great. A couple of questions. Obviously, a great cost quarter on the leverage side. Any changes in e-commerce gross margins to call out? Is scale and getting size, improving gross margins or anything on the mix shift there that\u2019s interesting? And then secondly, we talked about a lot about one day investment last year. Obviously, the shipping times were impacted by COVID, but are you back to kind of normal times? And where are you on the one day investment? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. On one day, again, we\u2019re first prioritizing employee safety. We have a lot of effort in that regard. We\u2019ve changed over 150 process paths. We\u2019ve instituted social distancing, cleaning, temperature taking, both with our warehouse employees and also our transportation employees. So that\u2019s really still priority one. And second is capacity expansion, especially as we head into the second half of the year, which generally sees a step-up in volume even over the first half of the year. So we will \u2013 we are improving the percentage of one day. We\u2019re not back to where we were pre-COVID. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be back in the short run, but we will continue to improve it. And hopefully, it\u2019ll be less noticeable for our consumer base. On the gross margin side, it\u2019s very much a mixed bag right now. There\u2019s \u2013 before the COVID outbreak, the positives were generally AMZL costs \u2013 delivery costs were becoming more efficient. Advertising was \u2013 and AWS were certainly a strong component of gross margin increases. Product mix could go either way depending on the country. But as this COVID has played out, consumables and grocery, which are lower margin, have started to \u2013 have been a negative impact on gross margin. But the \u2013 we feel good about where we are. Gross margin for the quarter was 40.8% and was down 200 basis points from last year. It\u2019s probably more tied to the addition of one-day shipping. And even if we didn\u2019t do as much one-day shipping as we\u2019ve been doing post COVID, the costs of one-day shipping are already built into our structure. We\u2019ve already reconfigured our network. We\u2019ve already created the capacity to be able to ship. It\u2019s just a matter of whether or not we can get it out through the warehouse and to you in one day or not.\nDavid Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions.

Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2020 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC. Including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration of the spread of the pandemic, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, work force staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures, our ability to continue operations in affected areas, and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns as well as the impact on suppliers creditors and third party sellers all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our business services and therefore, our actual results to differ materially from our guidance. And now I will turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Before we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to lead off with a few comments. What we've all seen transpire in the past two months has been gut-wrenching and unprecedented. But it has also been a time of heroic action by healthcare workers, government officials, police and emergency personnel and all essential workers in our communities. This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this critical time. I'd like to give you some insight into what we have seen at Amazon and how we are responding to this crisis. Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer demand. Particularly for household staples and other essential products, across categories such as health, and personal care, groceries and even home office supplies. At the same time we saw lower demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes, and wireless products. This large demand spike created major challenges in our operations network. And with our seller community and our suppliers, what we generally have experienced getting ready for spikes in demand for known events, like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods. The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to react to the higher order levels, while continuing to provide for the safety of our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, including maintaining six foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, tens of millions of gloves and wipes and other cleaning supplies. We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network. In our Whole Foods stores, we added plexiglass barriers between cashiers and customers, and reserve special hours for senior customers to shop. We temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums, we funded a new Amazon relief fund, and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their discretion. To deal with the unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. We took steps to dampen demand for non-essential products, including reducing our marketing spend. Our network pivoted to shipping priority products within one to four days and extending promises on non-priority items. Our independent third-party sellers, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses worked tremendously hard to serve our customers, and we are grateful for their efforts. Third-party sellers continue to see strong growth in our stores, with more than half of our units sold or from third-party sellers. We increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 60%, and expanded in store pickup at Whole Foods stores from 80 stores to more than 150 stores. And other Amazon teams shifted their focus to directly helping customers and the overall effort to fight the COVID virus. AWS has created data lake to assist healthcare workers, researchers, scientists and public health officials working to understand and fight the coronavirus. Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis, and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes, companies enabling video conferencing, remote learning and online health services, for example. Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC, with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance, and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels. How is all this impacting our business? While customer demand remains high the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at cost. We've invested more than $600 million in COVID related costs in Q1, and expect these costs could grow to $4 billion or more in Q2. These include productivity headwinds in our facilities as we provide for social distancing and allow for the ramp up of new employees. Investments in personal protective equipment for employees, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, our wages for our hourly teams and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop COVID-19 testing capabilities. In Q1, we also had another $400 million of costs related to increased reserves for doubtful accounts. On the flip side, we did see a drop in travel, entertainment and meeting costs, as well as lower marketing as a way to dampen our demand for non-essential items. While we can't have great certainty about what the next few quarters will look like, I'm humbled by the efforts of my fellow Amazonians in delivering essential goods and services to so many people. We take this responsibility seriously and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time. With that, let's open up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDouglas Anmuth: First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID related incremental costs in Q2, you talk about spending hundreds of millions on your own testing capabilities. Can you just talk about the strategic thinking there underlying trying to build this in-house versus sourcing from elsewhere? And does this potentially take you into a new business path over time? And then how do you think about the spending here in Q2 and whether over time does that change your margin structure for an extended period of time beyond just the next quarter? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Doug, first on testing. So, we estimate the testing will be about $300 million in Q2 if we're successful. We put some of our best people on it. I think everyone is trying to get testing. It's not readily available on the scale that we needed to test our scale of employees. So we are working to do that ourselves and to build protocols and to - and to again, we'll see how we do that differently and I don't know, you know again, about future business opportunities. Our main concern is, is getting testing in the hands of our employees and then potentially as we have excess capacity, perhaps we can help in other areas. On the spending, a lot of the costs that we're seeing are tied to this COVID response. Most of it is hitting in people cost, both in productivity and also in wages and relief funds and all. So can't really tell how long that will last. It's probably good that I am only - we\u2019re only giving guidance for Q2 at this point. We're going to probably learn a lot more in the next few weeks, next few months. And we'll continue to update this, but for now, most of what we see are temporary cost in the scheme of things, but certainly very expensive temporary costs. And also ones that we're not sure how long they'll last.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: I have two, Brian. The first one, is the current situation is, sort of I think, in many ways sort of showcase the ability of your network to provide goods for people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers. So I guess in light of that, can you talk to us at all about the impact you've seen on the Prime customer account from the current situation? And any color on how you've been able to expand Prime's reach into new customers or demographics from this? Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes going on in logistics and things, but Amazon is always a learning company. So any learnings you've had so far in the logistics side about how you actually may be able to learn some new best practices to run more efficiently post-COVID from the current [indiscernible] you've been going through?\nBrian Olsavsky: Well, I think we've learned that it's easier to get ready for a holiday or a Prime Day then it is to be ready for something like this when everything hits at once. High demand and also a need to restock automatically and prepare for it. So that's not something that we want to keep learning, but we're doing our best to maintain and provide key services for, and essential items for our Prime customers and all our Amazon customers. On the Prime program, what we're seeing is, again, you're seeing a lot of pickup in Prime shopping benefits. We see our prime customers are shopping more often and they have larger basket sizes. We're also seeing a lot more use of our video benefits and our digital benefits. So in March, for the first time viewers nearly doubled, which is I think a good time for people to when they're, a lot of them are staying at home to stay entertained. And you'll see our video collection. It's also beyond kind of Prime Video. It's also our channels and video rentals also went up, as I'm sure others in the entertainment business saw that as well. I think people are finding more benefit from Alexa when they're at home. They're listening to more music, asking questions, particularly questions related to COVID and issues around it. They're using it in education with their children. And I think we're seeing a lot more on the communication side using people using Alexa calling and drop in. So I think the Prime story is that shopping is, you know, really important for people now, especially when they, those people can't leave their houses. I think the digital benefits are scaling well. I think they are handling the additional demand, and it gives it gives people a good time and reason to use all of their Prime benefits that maybe they hadn't used as much in the past.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney: First, could you just talk about where you are in terms of fulfillment efficiencies? The way you track it pre-COVID, Amazon was able to, had some sort of level of standard of meeting demand with within a certain period of time, how low that got given the surge in demand, and where you are in terms of the recovery? In other words, when are you going to be - how long will it take for Amazon to get back to a point where you'd have the same sort of service efficiency levels on the retail side that you had pre-COVID? How far are you away from that? And then the second one was, could you talk about the AWS business? And I guess I would have expected maybe the growth rates were really robust, but maybe even a kick up in the growth rate? What are you seeing there in terms of, I assume there is much greater usage of AWS now? Is that something that would show up in the P&L, maybe on a delayed basis? Just talk about what's happening to that side of the business in this crisis. Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Well, we're happy with the growth in Q1on such a large base, again, we're, now it's $41 billion run rate, and that's 33% year-over-year. But what we're seeing post-COVID is, it varies by industry. I think what is probably where we're a bit well positioned is that we have such a breadth of customers, there's millions of active customers from start-ups, to enterprises, to public sector. So there's a lot of variance. And again, in what individual industries are seeing right now, things like videoconferencing, gaming, remote learning, entertainment all are seeing much higher growth and usage. And things like hospitality and travel certainly have contracted very severely, very quickly. So, I think there's going to be a mixed bag on industries, and of course this is will be tied to general economic conditions for the country and the world, quite frankly. So right now where we want to be there for our customers. We want to be able to scale up when they need us. We want to be there and support them regionally around the world. And we've been doing a good job at that, I believe. On the fulfillment efficiency, I think you were talking about one day, probably is the heart of your question, when we will get back to what we have seen and levels of one day. So a little bit on that. So again, as I mentioned in my introductory comments, we had to kind of absorb this shock of top line demand and also ability to stabilize our operations. We had to take the step to focus on essential items, extend the shipping period from one to four days, and then further on non-essential items. I had restrict things that were coming into the warehouses, and focus on the essential products. So we think that is still was the right course of action. And as we add capacity, we're trying to resume more normal operations as far as the shipping of non-essential items and the speeding up of one-day shipments. I will explain a bit on the one-day shipping cost, because it's aligned with this. So we originally thought we would spend $1 billion roughly on one-day shipping in Q1. And what we're seeing is, we pretty much spent about that same amount because it's - in the old days, we would have perhaps had the option to ship things two-day, three-day, four-day and seen a break on rates for the actual shipment. But most of our one-day costs are really what we've done to our logistics networks to allow for one-day shipping. Things like putting inventory closer to the customer, things like building up our AMZL network and delivery network and also having multiple pull times and shipping windows during the day. So those are actually coming in, all those things are coming in very handy to us to help get more capacity out of what we currently have. And we're glad we've made that investment, but we don't actually see a savings because we're still shipping things once they're available very quickly to customers. So it's really a combination of how long it takes to get things in stock, picked, packed and shipped. The shipping is still pretty fast and is still coming quickly. It's taking longer to get things into our warehouse and out of our warehouse. So that's really the challenge right now is to speed that up, and that will, when we do that we'll see a resumption of more one-day service. But, right now things are still so up in the air that I can't really project when that day will be or what point in Q2 or Q3 or beyond.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeath Terry: I did want to dig just a little bit deeper into your comments on AWS. Yesterday, during Microsoft's call they had mentioned that they had seen two years worth of digital transformation in the cloud in two months. I'm curious if you, how you would characterize sort of what you have seen as we've gone into April in terms of cloud adoption and what this has meant for AWS, and the rate of adoption or acceleration in that business, maybe more broadly? And then as we look at the guidance, the $4 billion for the expenses in the second quarter. If we adjust for that implies a pretty material increase in profitability quarter over quarter. Any sense of, or any sense that you can sort of share with us just what the drivers behind that profitability is? How much of that is annualizing the one-day investments in the efficiencies that you're seeing there, versus anything else in particular that you would that you would call out?\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, so first on AWS. I mean I don't have comments. You may have heard us talk about digital transformation. I think what I would say is, we've continue to see a healthy adoption of our business and healthy usage not only in the United States but globally. Our backlog of future contracts continues to build, and I still think the basic value proposition of AWS that we've always pointed to, things like having the most functionality, largest vibrant community of customers and partners having really proven operational and security experience. And building what customers need in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and other really key areas has not been impeded by this COVID crisis yet. And yes, we are seeing different performance in different industries. But our sales force is still there to help, help not only with current capacity, but also the transition to new, as people make that journey onto to the cloud. And then expand their use of the cloud. On the $4 billion, or sorry, on the Q2 guidance. I think the question is perhaps if how do we have a range that's above zero, if we have $4 billion of cost? Is that pretty much the essence of your question? I think there is - there are some efficiencies that would leverage that we get on fixed cost on higher volumes, even if they are somewhat breakeven on a contribution profit basis. There's some improvement in our cost structure when we have high volumes. There's also been a resumption of seller volume, especially from third parties using direct shipments to customers as companies are - you get more capability both in this country and other countries. We will continue to moderate our marketing in the time period when we have, again, very much the demand we are trying to fulfill is there and there's some products that are still out of stock. So it doesn't make sense to always do marketing, especially variable marketing in those situations. And we continue to, we believe we'll be saving travel and entertainment costs through the quarter. That's in, I would say in a couple of hundred million dollar size ranges on the cost. So there's a lot of moving parts here, but certainly the investment we're making in the COVID response is pretty significant. On the one-day, I would remind you that the one-day started in earnest Q2 of last year. So we're starting to lap that investment. It's not as large on a year-over-year basis as it's been in the past four quarters. And then the other thing that I would just point out is the - remember the impact of a change in the useful life of our servers, mostly hitting in the AWS business that was a $800 million benefit year-over-year in Q1. And that will continue into the rest of the year. And that that again is the benefit we're seeing from being able to use our server and infrastructure assets for a longer time period. We've been working on the ability to run them longer, it's a hardware and a software challenge. And as we have had success there operating at scale for over 13 years now, we've been able to extend our useful life for assets, or recognized that we have been extending the life. So that's a benefit that we've seen in Q1, and we'll see it the remaining from here on out.\nDave Fildes: Yes, just to add to that too, is I think about $800 million or nearly $100 million benefit in the first quarter, we do expect the change to the decrease as the year progresses some. Keep in mind.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Maybe two, if I can. One, on the demand of the revenue side, any difference in behavior you saw in various shelter in place geographies across the world, whether it be Europe versus in U.S. or Asia in the U.S. or India, in terms of consumer behavior or certain elements of adoption of certain product categories as we went through the month of March? Be curious for what differences you saw on a global scale, including on Prime adoption in response to COVID-19. And one quick one on the cost side of the equation, the cost of energy and oil have come down dramatically. Wanted to know if there was any way you would be able to call that out or an element of that in the overall cost structure as you do more of your own logistics over time. Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Sorry, Eric, I don't have much for you on the second point. Certainly we would look to see lower shipping costs. Although I would, but a lot of, I mean there's certainly things that we do long haul. There's things that we reposition, the airplanes. There's things that we do on long haul trucking, and that's where probably the fuel component would be larger. But we haven't quantified that, not for our guidance. I can't break it out for you right now. On how this may have played out differently in different geographies, we're actually seeing a lot of consistency, I would say in the types of products that people are buying in the state home restrictions. So it's been pretty consistent. There's obviously timing differences between countries, on one certain countries and when it's maybe ones where they are in their curve, and flattening the curve and all that. I think the biggest impact internationally has been in India, where of course, we similar to other companies in India, we're now only fulfilling our essential goods such as grocery. So that's cut back a lot on our offering, and we will further expand when the Indian government announces that were allowed to resume operations. So we're in a bit of a holding pattern except for grocery in India. And in France, there's been restrictions placed on us by the French courts. They did not impact Q1 business because essentially led to the closure of our French fulfillment centers in the middle of April. French customers are still able to order many millions of products from the selling partners we have who can ship directly to customers and through our global fulfillment. And we're continuing to appeal this court decision, but that's also different experience than the other countries internationally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post: A couple, just wondering if you're seeing any sustainable changes in consumer habits you could call out, such as people converting to Prime at a more rapid rate, adding more products in the consumable categories to their subscribe and save, anything you see that could really signal a longer-term change in consumer habits, faster adoption of certain categories. And the second thing for the revenue guidance for 2Q, does that assume a slowdown in growth in May and June related to the crisis? Thank you.\nDave Fildes: Justin, it's David. I think on some of the consumer behavior, I certainly point to grocery. If you look at the remainder of the online grocery is up in our online sales. So it's not isolated like you can see for physical stores, but we have seen an increased demand in online grocery shopping and we have a number of ways for customers to do that. Prime Now, Fresh and then of course Whole Foods online for delivery or pick up. And really beginning in March and continuing now through April, seeing that increased demand so, that's continued. And a lot of our focus is on working around the clock and offering as much delivery as possible. We've increased delivery order capacity more than 60%, and our stores have gone up. Whole Foods stores that offer pick up capability has gone from roughly 80 stores before the events to more than 150, so a lot of work being done there. On the physical stores, which you can see the growth there. It increased year-over-year at about 8%. That is predominantly Whole Foods, but it's the Whole Foods in-store shopping experience, rather than the online order. So that's up quite a bit from the run rate you've seen in some recent quarters. It's again similar, saw lot of folks that were a stay at home measures were not yet in place where shopping in large volumes and stocking up at our stores. Since that time more recently, we have seen some of those growth rates for the in-store shopping moderate some. So a lot of work being done there, both in for the workers that are doing to delivery in the workers that are in the stores. A lot of focus on our part to make sure that they're safe and healthy, and able to accommodate customers make sure customers are comfortable, however they choose to shop.\nBrian Olsavsky: And I'd add to that. Justin, I think the changes we've seen in the digital offerings will make people customer to those benefits and maybe advance their knowledge of what's available through - music, video, Alexa, certainly communication features on our devices. We launched Prime Video Cinema in U.S., U.K. and Germany where movies are going direct to pay-per-view because of lack of theaters. And that was a good move by the team and that's been very well received. We've also made a lot of kids and family content available free to watch on Prime Video. So I think people are getting a better look at what's available with the Prime membership.\nJustin Post: And then, second half of the quarter, are you assuming, kind of, we go back to normal as the quarter progresses and some deceleration?\nDave Fildes: Well we are heavily constrained, again it's an odd quarter because generally the biggest uncertainty we have this customer demand, and with the order and how much of it they'll order. Demand has been strong, the biggest questions we have in Q2 are more about ability to service that demand and that is the products that people are ordering in a full way, not blocking or making it hard to find non-essential items, increasing marketing, and everything else. So I think the challenge is really on everything besides the top line. And top line is certainly not to be taken for granted. There's always the importance of having attractive offerings in stock for customers. But usually things you can count on, the cost structure, the ability to get products, yes, your capacity for shipping and delivering, those are usually things that you can take for granted, and in this quarter, you can't. That's really where the uncertainty is driven.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Ju: So, Brian, I think the third-party unit mix de-indexed a little bit as a percentage of the total this quarter. I know that number jumps around a little bit, but is this primarily a matter of constrained delivery resources? And, I guess, the heightened demand? And any sort of ongoing supply chain concerns that remain worrisome for you from either a first-party perspective or from what the third-party sellers may be calling out. Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. I think there's still supply chain concerns on a lot of PPE, not only that we use, but also that we sell to customers, things like masks. There's general availability, but still outages of things like cleaning wipes, masks, talk about testing, but that's not something that we sell. So there are a lot of supply chain concerns are mostly in those areas right now. I'm sorry, I forgot the other part of your question. Can you remind me what you just\u2026\nStephen Ju: The third-party unit mix de-indexing a little bit as a percentage of total this quarter. I'm just wondering if that's just normal fluctuations, or are you just prioritizing the first-party delivery against what's probably limited resources on the heightened demand.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that, yes, it's a little off during this period, because it's not so much we're restricting and favoring 1P or anything. It's we're prioritizing essential items, and a lot of those tend to be, especially in the consumable area tend to be retail supplied items from vendors. So I would say that is the reason that FBA would have not have been as high as it normally would be. MFN is picking up a lot of the opportunity, and sellers are taking that opportunity ship direct because then it doesn't have to come into our warehouse obviously. So it's a bit of a different type of 3P mix right now. We're trying to minimize the impact on FBA sellers as we open up our warehouse as well. Many of them are also MFN or direct shippers to our customers. So it's the ability to satisfy demand of our customers from our seller community has never been more important and we're very grateful to our third-party sellers. They've been through a lot as well.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Blackledge: On advertising, the other revenue growth line accelerated. Could you just discuss how the advertising business performed in the first quarter? And any color on how it's trending in the second quarter if possible. And then in the release you indicated more, potentially more, hiring above the 175,000 headcount additions, any way to quantify and does this hiring replace kind of the seasonal hiring that you typically do at the end of the third quarter? Thanks.\nDave Fildes: Yes, sure. Let me start that second one, I don't have more for you on that. I think we'll announce as we change thresholds on hiring, we'll announce that at the time. Right now we've fully hired 175,000 people that we had discussed prior. 80,000 of them were in place at the end of the quarter. So the other 95,000 have been hired in April. On advertising what we've seen is it's been a very strong quarter in ad revenue. On your comment about other revenue accelerating, there's some other things going on in that other revenue account, the majority is revenue. But there's other, some other things, but I can tell you underneath that is that advertising growth rate has stayed consistent with last quarter. And we're very happy with the progression of that that offering for not only sellers, authors, vendors and positive impact it's had on customer selection. But we did start to see some impact. Yes. In March, some pullback from advertisers and some downward pressure on price, but how but advertising continues to advertise at a high cliff. It wasn't as noticeable maybe as with what some others are seeing, and it's probably offset a bit by the continued strong traffic we have to the site. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. We have again, as I said, downward pressure a bit on pricing. But I think we have a the large portion of our advertising relates to Amazon sales, not things like travel and auto which offsite which may have been disproportionately impacted at least early on here in the COVID crisis. And I think our advertising will prove to be very efficient as well. And it can be directly measured. So even as people are cutting back perhaps on advertising, or are their costs, I think this will be one area that will prove its value. It has in the past.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}], "2022": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-02-03 19:50:26", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2021 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, February 3, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by once again acknowledging and thanking our employees around the world for their efforts. This was the second holiday season during this pandemic, and it required exceptional collaboration and coordination among our employees and business partners to prioritize both safety and customer experience. The team did a great job of delivering for customers this holiday. Now, let\u2019s discuss our fourth quarter financial results. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $137.4 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to focus on offering the best experience for our customers across our businesses. On the consumer side, we welcomed millions of new Prime members in both the United States and international during the quarter, while continuing to see consistently high member renewal rates across geographies. Our third-party sellers, in particular, benefited from strong customer demand this holiday season. 3P sellers provided 56% of all unit sales in the quarter, the highest fourth quarter mix ever. And AWS saw a continuation of the strong usage and revenue growth we\u2019ve seen throughout 2021. AWS added more revenue year-over-year than any quarter in its history, and it\u2019s now a $71 billion annualized run rate business, up from $51 billion run rate one year ago. Even on a large base, revenue increased 40% year-over-year. As I\u2019ve mentioned in prior calls, we also encourage you to look at the multiyear compounded annual revenue growth rate since the onset of the pandemic to better put this revenue growth in perspective. Despite lapping 2020\u2019s extraordinary sales growth, we continue to see an increase in customer demand and sales during the remainder of 2021, even as the economy opened back up. For Q4, Amazon\u2019s two-year annual compounded growth rate was 25%, excluding impacts from foreign exchange, consistent with our rate in the third quarter. We\u2019ve invested significantly to keep pace with this demand, including nearly doubling our operations capacity in the past two years, expanding our fulfillment center footprint while adding significant transportation assets to ensure fast on-time delivery. There are now 1.6 million Amazon employees worldwide, also doubling in the two-year period. Our fourth quarter operating income was $3.5 billion. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we did see more than $4 billion in costs from inflationary pressures and loss productivity and disruption in our operations. The inflation primarily relates to wage increases and incentives in our operations as well as higher pricing from third-party carriers supporting our fulfillment network. Loss productivity and network disruptions were driven primarily by labor capacity constraints due to challenges in staffing up our facilities for peak. This is driven by the very tight labor market in the second half of 2021 and more recently by the emergence of the Omicron variant. We do expect these cost challenges to persist into Q1, albeit adjusted for lower seasonal volumes relative to the fourth quarter. Our results also include approximately $1 billion year-over-year negative impact from lower fixed cost leverage in our fulfillment network. Recall that we saw very high unit volumes for most of 2020 and the first half of 2021 and that fulfillment network was running at close to 100% capacity during this time. Now with more normal fulfillment capacity, our operating leverage decreases versus the comparable prior year periods. We expect to continue to see some negative year-over-year impact from this in Q1 of 2022. While we navigate these near-term headwinds, the fundamentals of our retail business are strong and we are optimistic about a number of growth businesses and a strong innovation pipeline. AWS delivered another strong quarter of growth as enterprises and developers continue to look to AWS for critical innovative cloud solutions. Now to $71 billion annualized revenue run rate, AWS revenue grew 40% year-over-year in Q4, our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth rate acceleration. We hosted our 10th re:Invent conference in the quarter, welcoming 26,000 in-person attendees and hundreds of thousands who attended virtually. re:Invent remains a highlight of the year for us because it\u2019s a great opportunity to introduce new services while engaging with customers and partners to better inform where we should be focusing next. We announced more than 115 new services and features during the event as businesses spanning all major industries continue to choose AWS as their technology provider to speed up innovation in their organizations. In the past quarter alone, NASDAQ announced a multiyear partnership to migrate North America markets to AWS, including their matching engine. Best Buy selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for cloud infrastructure services. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp selected AWS as its long-term strategic cloud provider to accelerate artificial intelligence research and development. And Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler Dodge, Fiat, Jeep and Ram selected AWS as its preferred global cloud provider for vehicle platforms to accelerate new digital products and upskill global workforce. You can find more examples in our earnings release of how the world\u2019s largest companies such as Adidas, Goldman Sachs, Pfizer, Rivian and more are using AWS to transform their businesses. Overall net income was $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter. While we normally focus our comments on operating income, I\u2019d point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation gain of $11.8 billion related to our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, which completed its initial public offering in November. Before we move to Q&A, there are three additional items I\u2019ll mention related to our disclosures. First, we are now separating advertising services revenue from other revenue as part of our revenue disclosures by groups of similar products and services. This updated presentation is provided in the supplemental financial information included in our earnings release. We\u2019re excited to continue innovating in areas like sponsored ads, streaming video and measurement. Of course, advertising only works so we make it useful for Amazon customers when we create great customer experiences, we deliver better outcomes for brands. Second, we\u2019re prospectively updating the useful life of our servers and networking equipment, beginning in January. As a practice, we monitor and review the useful lives of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations. We are increasing the useful life for servers from four years to five years and network equipment from five years to six years. As a result, our first quarter guidance includes an approximate $1 billion of lower depreciation expense. We expect the quarterly impact of this change to decrease throughout the year. Although we\u2019re calling out an accounting change here, this really reflects a tremendous team effort by AWS to make our server and network equipment last longer. We\u2019ve been operating at scale for over 15 years, and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. This then lowers stress on the hardware and extends the useful life, both for the assets that we use to support AWS\u2019 external customers as well as those used to support our own internal Amazon businesses. And finally, we will increase the price of Prime in the United States in Q1. We continue to make Prime better. In recent years, we\u2019ve added more product selection available with fast free unlimited shipping, more exclusive deals and discounts, and more high-quality entertainment, including TV, movies, music and books. Since 2018, Prime Video has tripled the number of Amazon Originals. And this September, Prime Video will also release the highly anticipated the Lord of The Rings: The Rings of Power and become the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football as part of an historic 11-year agreement with the National Football League. Since 2018 in the U.S., availability of same-day delivery has expanded from 48 metropolitan areas to more than 90. Items available for Prime free shipping have increased over 50%. And members have saved billions of dollars shopping on Prime days. It\u2019s all on top of new program benefits like prescription savings and fast free delivery from Amazon Pharmacy and the continually growing Amazon Music catalog for Prime members as well as Prime Reading and Prime Gaming. With the continued expansion of Prime member benefits, and the increased member usage that we\u2019ve seen as well as the rise in wages and transportation costs, Amazon will increase the price of a Prime membership in the United States with the monthly price going from $12.99 to $14.99 and the annual membership going from $119 to $139. This is our first price increase since 2018. For new Prime members, the price change will go into effect on February 18th. For current Prime members, the new price will apply after March 25th on the date of their next renewal. With that, let\u2019s move on to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will open up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. I want to come back to the comments in the release by Andy on same-day delivery. Can you talk a little bit about how many of those investments might be behind you versus ahead of you with respect to same-day delivery and how that sets the Company up with respect to either consumption behavior by consumers versus the competitive dynamic you\u2019re seeing against elements of like omnichannel and last-mile delivery competitors? Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Hi Eric, sure thing. So, on same-day, again, there\u2019s multiple levels of fast shipping here from ultrafast, which is essentially our grocery business in one to two hours to same day and less, and then one-day and two-day Prime. We feel good about where we are. We\u2019re continuing to build capacity that enables us to hit those cutoffs. I think his comments were more around getting us back to our pre-pandemic levels for one-day delivery and improving upon that and then getting same-day to more and more metropolitan areas. We\u2019re doing that globally as well, but we really think that that combination of speed for different product levels -- or product line, excuse me, really resonates with customers. And there\u2019s a lot of new offers for free -- or excuse me, generally free shipping on a fast basis. But we know how hard this is. And our goal is to do it and do it at a price that we can make money on as well and our cost structure commensurate with that. So, that\u2019s where the difficult work comes in, but we like the progress we\u2019ve made developing our Amazon Logistics capability over the last few years. And what we\u2019ve been adding, as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve doubled the capacity in the network over the last two years. That is not all just to handle today\u2019s volume. It\u2019s also to handle getting closer to the customer and being able to ship faster. So, we like where we stand. We know there\u2019s work to do on improving our customer service. We like the progress we\u2019ve been making lately, but we think the future is bright on that dimension.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Brian, the first one, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s changed within the retail business, sort of pre-pandemic, post-pandemic more same-day, more grocery, more last-mile investments in an ad business. Curious to hear, as you sort of -- you think about the long-term profitability of the retail segment, has your view about how you think about long-term profitability or cash flow retail fallen at all post-pandemic because of the higher required investments is the first one? Then the second one, like the new disclosure, I\u2019d be curious for any other disclosure about the number of engineers or the size of the teams you are working on a lot of the innovation that you talked about that are sort of more around early-stage nonrevenue-generating projects, we can better understand that investment in Amazon. Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. On the second one, we have a history of making long-term bets for customers, and some of those fall into very small short-term revenue businesses. They\u2019ll generally roll up into other revenue, which you see as very small after we\u2019ve separated out advertising. So, I think that you do see it in our revenue disclosure generally. But a lot of our profitability is shown at the segment level, and we\u2019ll continue to do that with the revenue disclosure. You asked about the business model. I think it\u2019s a good question. And we are -- as we reflect over the last two years, we are encouraged by a lot of things. You ticked them off there, the adoption of digital benefits, the use of grocery and how valuable that\u2019s become to customers, not to mention the acceleration of companies going to the cloud. The ability to double our fulfillment capacity over that time period, including making major strides in our Amazon Logistics sets us up well for the future. And -- but we\u2019ve been also dealing with a lot of disruption during this time period. So, the early wave of disruption was handling volume without the capacity to handle it, and then, quickly playing catch-up. And as that was starting to improve, labor took a turn in the United States, especially labor availability, and we\u2019ve really had scrambled to add workers. We\u2019ve been successful at it. We added over 273,000 employees in the last half of last year. But I think if you look at the prior year, it was over 400,000. So, there\u2019s a lot of expansion that\u2019s been going on in the network. And we feel good about the basic contributors of profitability. There\u2019s -- if you step back, there\u2019s procurement margin and working with vendors and sellers as well. There\u2019s fees in some cases, for 3P services and Prime, as we just mentioned is going up. Advertising has certainly added a layer of contribution over the last few years. But again, that only works and is only successful if we make it a good customer experience. So, we\u2019re really working hard to do that. And that becomes a part of our ability to offer lower prices, better selection and more convenience. So, if you take those, those are all stable and strengthening areas. It\u2019s really the onus \u2013 our onus is to get our operational efficiency back in all of our areas of cost. We have, again, built a lot of capacity. We\u2019ve hired a lot of people. Some of those people are still -- our teams are all battling Omicron right now. But, we do see the sun coming out and getting better here over the next number of quarters, and that\u2019s going to be where we\u2019re going to put a lot of our effort.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you doubled your fulfillment network and also your headcount over the past two years. I believe you\u2019re about 2.5 years into this investment cycle. Where is Amazon in terms of emerging from this investment cycle? Can you see a slowdown in that big investment spending this year?\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about capital expenditures. And I\u2019m going to do this with the inclusion of equipment finance leases, which is the residual that we sometimes lease on our infrastructure assets. We\u2019re doing less of it now, but we still do some and have done it historically. So, when you look at those numbers and how they\u2019ve grown over the last few years, I\u2019ll give you the proportions, which I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve initially shown before is about 40% -- just under 40% of that CapEx is going into infrastructure, most of it\u2019s feeding AWS, but also certainly, Amazon is a large customer of that as well as we build and structure for ourselves directly or through AWS. About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building out our AMZL network, principally globally. The remaining 5% or so is small things like offices and stores and other capital areas. But those are the three main areas. If I look to the future, we\u2019re still working through some of our plans 2022, but it\u2019s coming into focus a bit. We see the CapEx for infrastructure going up. We still have a very fast-growing business this growing globally, and we\u2019re adding regions and capacity to handle usage that still exceeds revenue growth in that business. So, we feel good about making those investments. On the fulfillment center side, that\u2019s about 30% of the spend in the last two years. We see that moderating and that will probably now match growth of our underlying businesses. I think there\u2019s always things that can tick up that growth rate, things like expansion of our FBA business, expansion of cube that maybe not be different than the square footage. So, there\u2019s -- we want to have capacity to have a healthy retail and FBA business because that fuels prime in 1-day delivery and 2-day delivery and same-day delivery. So, that\u2019s very important. But we see the FC piece likely moderating this year. And then the third piece is transportation. We still see additional levels of investment in that in 2022. So, if you wrap that up, we expect CapEx including equipment finance leases to increase year-over-year. I can\u2019t give you the exact percentage, but hopefully, it gives you a little more dynamic on what -- how we approach it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: You lay out all of these costs that you were expecting to see in the December quarter. Just talk to whether there are any real surprises to you. So, it looks like you had a little bit greater leverage than you may have thought. And then use that to help us think about what the -- I think you said the sun is coming out. Financially, does that mean that we\u2019re going to have a kind of nice improvement in operating margins as we go through the year as some of those temporary costs get temporized and you get to absorb some of the more fixed costs? So, just talk about where the surprise was in terms of those costs that you laid out for the December quarter, the $6 billion? And how should we think about those playing out as we go forward?\nBrian Olsavsky: Okay, Mark. Just remember that I\u2019m sitting in Seattle. So, my view of the sun coming out is a little different than perhaps where you are. But we do see things improving. We do -- let\u2019s step back to Q4. We had said that we would have about $4 billion of additional costs due to labor shortages and the inefficiencies of that cause as well as increased labor rates and shift differentials of premiums and external transportation costs. We came in just slightly over that $4 billion. I think things went as expected. I would say that the hiring was strong, but we could have done better. We could have had more people, so we had to cover a lot of -- there was additional overtime. There are some higher costs on third-party transportation. But, all-in-all, the challenge in Q4 was to staff, raise -- or excuse me, increase the staffing, and we said we wanted to add 150,000 people or more. We added net-net of about 140,000 in the quarter, 273,000 in the second half of the year. So, as you turn the page into 2022, we feel good -- better about labor, except Omicron has kicked up, and now you have a different type of labor issue where there\u2019s a lot of people who are on leave of absences and short term as they work to have a positive test on COVID and can get back into the workforce and protect their fellow workers. So, there\u2019s instances where you\u2019re paying twice or 3 times for the same labor hour if someone is on leave, you\u2019re paying them and you\u2019re also paying potentially for someone who\u2019s covering the shift on over time. So, there\u2019s cost pressure in Q1. I think, the good news is that the labor challenge is not as great in Q1 as it is in Q4 -- Q3 and Q4. So, we\u2019re hopeful on that. We have to work to now make our operations more efficient as we get staffing levels up. And we\u2019re going to plow a lot of our effort into increasing our transportation speeds and beating our pre-pandemic levels. So, there\u2019s a lot of different challenges going on right now. The team has been working heads down for over two years now. So, they need -- we\u2019ve got a great team, and we have confidence that we will -- things will improve as we get through the year. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird.\nColin Sebastian: I wanted to ask about AWS, and nice acceleration in revenues there. Wondering if you could talk about maybe more specifically the driver of that acceleration. Is the application layer maybe now large enough where you\u2019re seeing that contribute incrementally to growth? And I think in the release, you also highlighted infrastructure expansion globally. I think it might be interesting to add some context around the scale or distribution of the AWS business internationally outside of North America, if you could put some context around that. Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Colin. Thanks for your questions. On the growth rate, I think it\u2019s a combination of things. We\u2019ve been adding resources in sales and marketing over the last few years, and that is starting to pay off. There was some cutback in spending in the early parts of 2020 that we\u2019re lapping as people -- different companies have different COVID experience, some their volumes went through the roof, some their volumes went through the floor. So as things have stabilized, I think the lasting thing is that a lot of people made the commitment to go to the cloud, better understood the benefits of that and probably accelerated their internal time lines for that. And we\u2019re there to help, and we\u2019re working very hard to make that journey a successful one and we have a strong team of sales and marketing professionals to help as well as technical advisors. So that is what we\u2019re seeing, and we\u2019re pleased with the acceleration in the business the last four quarters. We will see -- we\u2019re also pleased with the efficiency of the infrastructure investment, as I mentioned, the expansion of useful life is not done on an accounting basis unless you have proof that it\u2019s actually -- we\u2019re seeing it in real life. So, very positive indicators in AWS.\nDave Fildes: Colin, it\u2019s Dave here. Just following up on the international point, what we\u2019re seeing outside of the U.S., I mean we are -- as part of that overall strong growth, we are continuing to see considerable momentum really around the world. It\u2019s customers moving their workloads over to AWS at different phases. And so, as you look at the release, some of the other announcements, there\u2019s a good diverse list of companies, Adidas in Germany migrated its SAP environments to AWS, in the Netherlands, Stellantis selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider. There\u2019s a number of really great companies examples doing different big things at different stages of that migration. What\u2019s been important to us, amongst many things is continuing to expand our global infrastructure footprint really to support this momentum we\u2019re seeing. So, just this last quarter in the fourth quarter, we opened the Asia Pacific region over in Jakarta. And we\u2019ve got announcements for plans to launch and Canada in the Calgary region next year or perhaps it 2023 or 2024. So, a lot of work and a lot of momentum. Those are just a few examples. But where we sit now, it\u2019s -- AWS has 84 availability zones in 26 regions around the world right now. And just in terms of the forward-looking road map, we have announced to launch 24 more zones in 8 more regions, and those will be here in the next couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. So, I just want to dig a little bit into third-party seller services. The growth slowed there even on a two-year stack. So maybe if you could talk about some of the factors that you think could be weighing on that? And then, just on AWS, you kind of laid out some color there. Is there any bottlenecks to growth that you\u2019re still seeing? I mean, you talked about why this is a very good quarter and having to do with some of the comps, but any bottlenecks to grow, either supply chain or employee related? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sorry. Jason, is your second question on AWS?\nJason Helfstein: Yes, on AWS.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, sorry. Let me start with that. No, we don\u2019t see bottlenecks on the capacity side or -- probably the limiter in that business is our ability to work with customers to accelerate their time lines. So, we\u2019re investing and working hard to do that. So -- but operationally, we continue to add capacity, as I mentioned, on the capital section -- capital discussion, and we expect that to increase year-over-year in 2022. On 3P, I think what you\u2019re seeing is a decreasing growth rate, much like the rest of the business, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re dealing with the very high growth period from Q3 of 2020 through Q1 of 2021. But on a two-year basis, you\u2019re still seeing 31% compounded annual growth in the 3P seller services revenue. Granted that was in the -- it was 34% last quarter, but it\u2019s maintaining. I think the bigger point is that sellers are definitely big winners in Q4. The percentage of units up to 56% was a record for 3P. We continue to invest a lot to make sellers -- help sellers be successful on our site. They\u2019re a big consumer of advertising as well because they use it to build their brands and add -- enable customers to see their selection and make purchases. So we\u2019re very happy with the third-party seller services businesses, and again, looking for ways to help sellers be successful.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great. Maybe I\u2019ll talk about advertising services. What -- maybe tell us why you decided to break it out, if you haven\u2019t already? And then, how much Prime Day might have been a factor in the deceleration? But bigger picture, how much room does that line have to grow bigger than GMV growth? How do we think about where you are on penetration on that? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Let me start with why we broke it out. We\u2019ve looked at the proportion of other revenue that is advertising services. And we got to a point where -- and I had been pretty much mentioning every quarter that for the majority of that line item was advertising revenue. And we feel it at a certain size that we should break it out and split the other half of that. So, that was really the impetus for the change. And we look at those things every year, and end of year was a good time to do it as we start 2022. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful for you to understand the growth rate without having to impute it from the other revenue. The growth rate in the quarter of 33% was down from 66% in Q4 of last year. Q4 last year obviously had Prime Day in it for first time. And Prime Day carries a lot. I can\u2019t scale it for you, but there\u2019s a lot of advertising tied to Prime Day, obviously. So when that moves quarters, it generally has an impact on the run rates. We saw that a bit in Q2 of this year when we did have Prime Day and it was lapping -- Q2 2021 was lapping, the 2020 period that didn\u2019t have a Prime Day in it. So, that will move around a bit. But I think the bigger story here is the success we\u2019re having with sellers and vendors, and making that a useful product for customers.\nDave Fildes: And Justin, just to add to that, I mean the priorities with advertising are -- at a high level, it\u2019s improved the tool usability. We think there\u2019s great feedback loops with customers, as Brian mentioned, to keep building and making that better. That results in building more relevancy and better engaging experiences. And again, the more we can interact with the advertisers, the customers and learn and have more opportunities to hear from them and understand that we can build better analytic tools, provide better measurement, give them better insight in performance. So, really focused on serving brands. And it\u2019s in the sponsored ad space, but we\u2019ve talked about video advertising is certainly a great opportunity. And as we\u2019ve got properties like Fire TV, IMDb TV, Twitch, live sports, a lot of exciting things that have been going on in the live sports and certainly to come this year as well, both in the NFL here in the U.S., but overseas in a number of properties, really excited to kind of work with folks. And again, this is about delivering good recommendations to customers and helpful when they\u2019re making their purchase decisions and giving them information around that. And that, in turn, of course, helps the advertisers as well and have a great result. So, I think that\u2019s one area that we\u2019re excited about. Longer term, demand-side platform opportunities with Amazon DSP is something that we\u2019re continuing to work on and refine and again, focus on the customer as we always do.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen.\nJohn Blackledge: Two questions. First, could you discuss how supply -- the supply chain affected the business in 4Q, and how we should think about perhaps impacts from supply chain issues in 1Q \u201822 and for the year? And then, the second question would be, do you expect to increase Prime pricing in non-U.S. markets? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Hi, John. Thank you for your question. First on the Prime question. We evaluate each country differently. We look at the relative price to the customer versus our cost to supply that and the usage and the value that we\u2019re creating for customers. We felt, especially after not raising the price in the United States since 2018 that the time was right to raise it. And we think it\u2019s a much more valuable program today than it was in 2020, let alone 2018. So, other countries, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate every year and nothing else to announce right now. On supply chain, there\u2019s specific things that I think we all see in the supply chain where we\u2019re waiting for products. But as far as Amazon is concerned, we did a lot to combat the supply chain issues we saw in Q4 or anticipated in Q4. We bottled product ahead. We work with vendors to secure inventory early, in some cases, paid earlier, which had a working capital impact. We also worked very hard to open up channels of -- existing channels of input into the country, whether it was port capacity or vessel capacity. So, we did everything. We knew how to as far as trying to get more capacity in a constrained market. And we think it worked for our customers in Q4 as challenges remain in \u201820, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve totally passed that, but we don\u2019t expect it to be a big issue in Q1.\nOperator: Our final question is from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.\nDan Salmon: First, I just wanted to follow up a little bit and see on the advertising numbers, if there\u2019s any qualitative color that you could add, say, rough balance of performance advertising versus brand advertising, maybe U.S. versus rest of the world. Anything you add could be great. And then, just second, Brian, you mentioned the exclusive broadcast of Thursday Night Football and is one of the reasons supporting a higher price increase for Prime. Dave, you mentioned it as an element that is a dynamic new one for the advertising business. Maybe could we just return to that point as the sort of importance of live sports in the video space is incredibly important, is that one that you see kind of taking the business to a new level at this stage?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with that second question. So, I didn\u2019t want to leave you with the impression that we raised prices because there\u2019s any football. I just use that as an example of great new content that we\u2019ve been investing in for Prime members to make the Prime membership more valuable as well as international sports, we had one of the highest rated games in the Q4 with, I believe, is Manchester United and -- I\u2019m going to mix up the team, sorry.\nDave Fildes: Arsenal, I don\u2019t know.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, I won\u2019t embarrass myself. But, the -- so again, we\u2019ve been working on getting sports properties that will be beneficial and valuable to prime offering. We\u2019re still probably early on in that. We\u2019ve had obviously success with Premier League Soccer, other soccer leagues around the world, Tennis properties and also probably the marquee as the work with the NFL on Thursday Night Football.\nDave Fildes: Dan, in terms of just break out, I think as we\u2019ve said before, on the advertising side, the sponsored products and brands, they make up the majority of the ad revenue today. We haven\u2019t given a split on a geographic basis. But suffice to say, a lot of these efforts, Brian talked about, whether it\u2019s on the video, advertising opportunities for -- in those sponsored products and sponsored brand efforts, we\u2019ve replicated a lot of the tools and features and services around the world and are kind of constantly learning and building out the brand and the presence with that so we can make better inroads with customers over the long term.\nBrian Olsavsky: And because I don\u2019t want to leave you hanging, Dan, the Manchester United and Arsenal soccer game in December was the most watched Premier League match ever on our service with an estimated viewership of 4 million. So, I think that is actually pretty interesting because we\u2019ve had a lot of increasingly good relationship with the Premier League. We\u2019ve had Boxing Day games, and we continue to be a valuable partner for each other.\nDave Fildes: With that, thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-10-28 23:14:09", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the amazon.com Q3 2021 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 28t, 2021 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. Let me first start by reiterating and expanding on a few comments that Andy made in our earnings release. We are now reporting our results for the seventh quarter since the pandemic began and we're especially proud of our employees for both their response to the unprecedented customer demand we have experienced, as well as for their implementation of many safety procedures to create a safe work environment. During this period, we have continued to earn the trust of our customers, especially our Prime members, who have increased their annual purchases and their use of Prime benefits over the last 20 months. We've also seen strong growth in our advertising products, as vendors and sellers have embraced our ability to build their brands and to reach customers just as they are considering their purchases. And AWS has seen a reacceleration of revenue growth as customers have expanded their commitment to the cloud and selected AWS as their cloud partner. As a result, Amazon 's Q3 revenue of $110.8 billion represented a two-year compounded annual growth rate of 25% versus a pre-pandemic growth rate in the low 20% range. We're grateful to our customers who have put their trust in us. However, there have certainly been challenges to overcome since February of last year. We've nearly doubled our operations capacity in the past two years to keep up with customer demand. We've incurred billions of dollars in additional cost to keep our employees safe and to support testing and other COVID-related costs. And we have grown our global headcount by 628,000 employees in the past 18 months and are recruiting for more, including more than 150,000 in the U.S. to support Q4 seasonal demand. This demand for labor has recently coincided with the shortage of available workers, particularly in the United States. It began in Q2, but it really started to impact our operations and cost structure in Q3. It's led to wage increases and sign-on incentives, as companies compete for workers, as well as inconsistent staffing levels in our operations. In addition, disruption to the global supply chains and inflation in the cost of materials such as steel and services such as trucking have also raised our cost of operations. We estimate the cost of labor, labor-related productivity losses, and cost inflation to have added approximately $2 billion in operating costs in Q3, particularly in August and September. Our Q4 guidance range anticipates that these costs will approach $4 billion in Q4 as we see a full quarter's impact of these effects and a higher seasonal unit volume. Specify in Q3, we saw nearly $1 billion of inflationary pressures, primarily tied to wage increases and incentives in our operations. Our average starting wage is now over $18 per hour, with an additional $3 per hour depending on shifts in many locations and sign-on bonuses that can be up to $3,000. In addition, we saw inflationary pressures in raw materials and services, as I mentioned, particularly in steel and third-party trucking. We also saw over $1 billion of cost tied to loss productivity and disruption in our operations. In Q3, labor became our primary capacity constraint, not storage space or fulfillment capacity. As a result, inventory placement was frequently redirected to fulfillment centers to have the labor to receive the products. This resulted in less optimal placement, which leads to longer and more expensive transportation routes. In short, our operations are normally well-staffed and optimized to be in-stock and to deliver to customers in one to two days. Labor shortages in supply chain disruptions upset this balance and resulted in additional costs to ensure that we continue to maintain our service levels to customers. As you look to Q4, we've incorporated this nearly $4 billion of added costs into our operating income guidance range. In addition, we have a nearly $1 billion year-over-year increase in Q4 for spend to support our digital media content efforts, including video, music, and games. We recently launched New World, a multiplayer online PC game, and we're delighted with the response and engagement. New World has become the highest played new game this year on Steam. Moving to video content. Prime Video has a compelling lineup of live sports, including the UEFA Champions League and Ligue 1 soccer in France, as well as NFL Thursday Night Football in the United States. And we have a great lineup of original series to look forward to, including the Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and Citadel and new seasons from Jack Ryan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Boys. We're excited to add this content to our Prime benefits and increase the value of our Prime membership. Q4's guidance also includes an estimated $1 billion year-over-year negative impact from lower fixed cost leverage in our fulfillment network. Recall that we saw very high unit volumes in Q4 of last year, and then our fulfillment centers were running at close to 100% capacity as we work to add physical capacity to match demand. As we're now back to having more normal Q4 fulfillment capacity and have even brought forward 2022 capacity into 2021, our operating leverage drops compared with last Q4. Our revenue guidance for the fourth quarter reflects the current trends we are seeing, including the lapping of our Prime Day Event in October of last year. We are dealing with labor risks and supply chain interruptions like many other companies, which increases our range of potential outcomes in Q4. Consumers have started to return to pre-pandemic spending patterns, increasing the mobility and spending more on travel and services in Q2 and Q3. But we're appreciative that the incremental demand that came our way during the pandemic has remained and that we're continuing to grow on top of that. We're all set to make this a great holiday season for customers. Last quarter, we discussed the physical capacity we were adding to meet customer demand. We made strong progress in Q3 to build and open new facilities. And as a result, for the first time since the pandemic began, we're no longer capacity constrained for fiscal space in the network. September alone, we brought online more than 100 new buildings in the United States, including fulfillment centers, source centers, and last-mile delivery stations. For the year, we expect our 2021 footprint additions to exceed last year's buildout, which was also significant. Put this in perspective, we are on track to double our fulfillment network over the two-year period since the pandemic's early days. A lot of this increased capacity supports our FBA sellers. Third-party sellers and the products they offer remain an important strength of our offerings for customers, representing 56% of total paid units sold in Q3, that's up from 54% in Q3 of last year. And we're working with these partners, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, to build an even stronger offering. We recently hosted Amazon Accelerate, a U.S. conference for selling partners, where we introduce new tools and capabilities, including local selling, which enables sellers to start or expand their multichannel offerings by providing both in-store pickup and fast delivery to nearby customers and global selling tools to make it easier for U.S. third-party sellers to offer their products worldwide. I'll finish with a few highlights regarding two fast-growing areas with strong profitability profiles. First, we saw continuation of strong usage and revenue growth in AWS, with revenues accelerating to 39% year-over-year in Q3, driven by a broad base of services and customers. There are number of areas we're excited about, but let's focus for a moment on our efforts in machine learning. Customers of all sizes and across all industries are using AWS as their preferred cloud provider for machine learning services. We've been investing in this area for several years, offering an extensive set of machines learning services, including ones that can be applied to common business problems, like Amazon Connect for contact center intelligence, or Amazon Kendra for intelligent enterprise search. We recently launched solutions specific to industries, including industrial machine learning services, as well as Amazon Health Lake to help healthcare and life sciences customers seamlessly transform their data across disparate sources to understand and extract meaningful medical information. And Amazon SageMaker continues to help customers scale their use of machine learning to core workloads, making it one of the fastest-growing services in AWS history, with tens of thousands of active external customers using it every month. We also continue to see strong interest in rapid adoption of our custom silicon and AWS design Graviton2 processors, delivering customers up to 40% better price performance than current X86 processors. Moving to Graviton2 means little to no code changes, so that customers can quickly and easily migrate their workloads to access the best price performance in Amazon EC2. Last but certainly not least, Amazon Advertising continues to grow quickly, representing the significant majority of other revenue, which grew 49% year-over-year in Q3. We're seeing strong adoption across Amazon vendors, sellers, and authors, as well as brands that don't sell in our store, particularly as we've built out our streaming TV offerings. Of course, advertising only works if we make it useful for customers. And when we create great customer experiences, we deliver better outcomes for brands. The team also recently hosted unboxed 2021, our annual conference for advertisers and brands, where we shared some of our newest solutions to help companies connect with their customers, measure the impact of their advertising, and grow their businesses. As we shift into Q4, we're heads down, focused on delivering a great experience for our customers this holiday season. We are committed to make the necessary investments in both people and capacity to bring more items in stock and to deliver them quickly to customers. With that, let's move on to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post: Great. Maybe I will ask about fulfillment capacity. You said your capacity is up 2x since before the pandemic and I've got units up around 55% on a two-year basis. So just wondering, is the capacity needed per unit going up as you speed up delivery times and try to get to one day? And then second, are you in really good shape for next year? And could you be ahead of plan for next year and kind of cut down the investment there? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Hi, Justin. On your first question about whether we've \u2013 the comparison of doubling the fulfillment capacity to the unit growth. Keep in mind also that our fulfillment capacity also includes our transportation delivery capacity. And in the last two years, we've also greatly ratcheted up our ability to deliver ourselves through NCL, and our percent of units that we deliver through MCL is over 50% of our units globally. So that's a big -- that's a driver as well. I'd also say that while we've been chasing really demand for last two years, we've been doing it is, as I said, we're running about 100%, pretty much all of last year. We are just now getting caught up on space for inventory and inventory is being brought in to support the holiday. And if you look year-over-year, while units growth is, as you say, closer to 8% in Q3, the cubic -- inventory cube is up closer to 40%, both in North America and internationally. So, there's like the second shoe that's dropping of getting the fulfillment centers back in stock, especially for sellers and especially as we head into holiday. So that's a -- I think that capacity, the amount of space we have for inventory is also going up probably at a higher rate than our unit ship right now. Your question about whether it pulls forward from next year, we're not forecasting into next year. We do see that we will -- we expect growth, and as I mentioned on the last call, we think that the growth will be suppressed for the four quarters that end middle of Q2 next year, but we expect -- just as a comp versus 2020 just because of the 40% growth we saw last year. But we expect the long- term trends to be strong in this business. We're investing in such -- as I mentioned, the two-year CAGRs, I do that just so you can kind of judge pre-pandemic versus today. We see strong growth even off a base of last year, which was strong. So, we'll see next year on CapEx, and certainly for the foreseeable future, our capacity constraint is actually labor, which is new and not welcome. That's what we've tried to articulate here today. And we are hoping that that rectifies itself through Q4 and into early 2022.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney: Great. Two questions. First, any color around those international losses in the quarter that was large achievement by Amazon standards, that $900 million? And then secondly, talk about the - you've been spending -- so you've doubled this fulfillment capacity. I think they're really kind of catch up to demand, but now I think like you're getting ahead of it. And as you roll out, you get close to one-day promise that you worked up two or three years ago pre-pandemic, and as you start rolling out, super same-day delivery or what you call sub one-day delivery. Talk about the incremental demand, do you think that that could unlock into the extensive which you're investing against not only to catch up to demand, but trying to liberate future demand if you get my point? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky : Yeah. I definitely do, and I'm glad you brought that up because I didn't include it in my last answer. But yes, we have unfinished business on the one-day promise side. We were ramping that up nicely in 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic. We're still not back to levels that we saw pre-pandemic. We're getting closer. We feel again that labor constraints have not helped us close the gap there. But we don't want to be as good as -- just as good as we were before the pandemic. We expect that to increase in 2022, and we're going to plan accordingly. And I think you start to see the difference in the growth rate before and after that one day. I won't forecast it too much, but we do -- we did see pick-up and we saw really that we got into the consideration set for more purchases. When something's available in one day or less, now you really don't have to go to a store even if you need it very quickly. So, it just opens up more ways for us to serve our customers, especially our Prime customers. On your comment about international, yes, you're right, it was a larger loss than in prior quarters. In fact, we had flipped to positive operating income through the pandemic. A lot of that was again getting two years of volume growth on top of a one-year's -- current year cost structure. There's also a bit of a slowdown just in content and other things, although we're building that, we would have built it at a higher clip. But the long-term trends remain the same in international. It's a group that has a very different life -- we're in different stages in different countries. The established countries of Europe and Japan are further along, obviously, and they perform closer to the North America results. We have new countries. We've added a lot in the last few years, the investments in Brazil, the Middle East, Australia, and adjacent countries of Poland and Sweden within Europe. So those are all important investments, but they start as an investment. And they -- we build over time and we front-load a lot of Prime benefits in those countries, especially things like video. We find video as a really strong, excuse me, attractor of customers and it's a gateway to Prime in a lot of those countries. So, the model is a bit flipped as versus what we saw in North America, just because we added video later in the game. But we like what we see and we see the actual the hours watched in the percent of Prime members who watch video is actually higher in a lot of the countries, the new countries that we're getting into. So, we're - as we said, we're going to make money long-term in international. Right now, it's a bit of an umbrella that catches a lot of different countries in different stages. We're happy with both the established countries. They are also seeing, however, the pressures that we're seeing in United States on labor and cost and disruption from supply chains. So, can't forecast this any further at the segment level, but just want to give you a little color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Brian, just curious, how have you fared in pulling holiday shopping earlier thus far this quarter? And to what degree can that help ease some of the impact? And perhaps, what did you learn there last year from having Prime Day in 4Q? And then can you just also talk a little bit about the drivers of AWS acceleration and how you think about the margin profile with more contribution from enterprise deals? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky : Sure. Yes. Let's start with the holiday shopping. So yes, you're right. Last year, we -- as we look back, we used Prime Day to pull a lot of holiday shopping forward. And people knew that delivery capacity across all retailers was going to be tight, so it was more distributed to the quarter. Obviously, that works better for us than to have it all hit in a few concentrated weeks around Cyber Monday and Black Friday and the week before and two weeks after. So operationally, it's easier to perform when the volume is spread out. You are seeing a lot of promotional activity from us in October. Again, trying to do what we did last year, just pulled some demand to get people to buy and to buy early. We think that's to their advantage. Although we're preparing to serve people throughout the whole quarter, we feel we've done a good job of lining up inventory commitments that are larger than normal. We've looked at getting more container capacity. We've been successful in that. We've accessed new ports and parts of entry into U.S. So, we're doing everything we can, granted it's at a cost penalty in many cases, but we are -- we feel good about being able to serve customers this Q4. Love it in October, but we will take it in November and December as well. On AWS, the acceleration, I would -- again, I would say that what we're seeing is, again, a lot of customers accelerate their journey to cloud based on the pandemic. Some of their spending was suppressed in 2020 as they -- it's different, some companies were booming. Disney, Zoom, Netflix, others that were more travel-related were suppressed in their demand. Then I think there's a general level of recovery across a lot of our customer base. We're expanding our customer base into a lot of different areas, a lot of new different customers. We add many new products. I highlighted a few of our machine learning products, so we feel really good about the acceleration in growth. We know there were some suppression last year, but it was -- the growth last year was still in the 28% to 32% - or excuse me, 28% to 33% range through on an FX-neutral basis through most of the year. On the margin side, the margins are going to be -- they're not going to fluctuate over time. There's a lot of moving parts. There is a lot of extensions of contracts and long-term commitments, which are great for our business and great for customers. So, there's negotiated long-term deals, there's also a lot of investment in new capacity in new regions to service high usage. We're certainly adding -- continuing to add to our sales force and marketing teams. And then the counterbalance on that is how well we run our data centers, what efficiencies we get, what cost reductions we get. So, it's always going to be varying. We like where we are and will not forecast forward. But again, they are apt to change, but we're working hard to keep them high and well passing through benefits and efficiencies to customers in lower pricing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, Brian. The first one, I wanted to kind of ask a big picture question about the retail business. I know there's a lot of extra costs sort of moving through the system now, but maybe can you just talk to us, big picture about any changes or factors that have changed the Company's view about the long-term profitability, the long-term return on invested capital of the retail business now, as opposed to at the end of 2019? Then the second one is on the physical stores. You have quite a few different formats and experiments going on in the physical stores. Talk to us about areas where you've seen sort of the most positive results from physical stores, where you're pleased as opposed to areas where you still see room for improvement in the physical store strategy. Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with your comment on the, we'll call it the core retail business. We're very bullish on the retail business. In fact, it's impossible and not productive to even try and separate advertising from third-party from retail. It's all, to us, part of a flywheel where we service customers. We do it in an efficient way and we earn their trust in their future business, and we fight that battle every day. And we look to expand the Prime program to build that flywheel. We look to add new products and services like grocery and video and music and the list is long. So, when you look at retail, certainly expensive right now, especially with the costs I\u2019ve laid out in Q3 and Q4, for us to service that business. However, we have other monetization vehicles, including advertising that if we do well, become a benefit to customers and to advertisers at the same time. That's what we work on. So that is an important part of our profitability structure. It's tied directly to happy customers and customers who are engaged in buying things. So, we don't separate those two. We do for some reasons. We want to make sure that we're understanding where our cost and where our profits happen to be. But we do realize it's all part of the same customer offering. So \u2013 and we like the return on investment flywheel. We do. We - I get to see investments in warehouses trucking programs, new offerings that we do in new country expansion. We segment those as much as we can into discrete decisions. And then we track them and make sure that not only are we delighting customers or delighting shareholders in the long-term. So, we feel good about that. Certainly, the cost of fulfillment in the last few months and what we forecast into the next quarter are not what we're happy about, but we see ourselves as the shock absorber, absorbing a lot of the costs, so that the customers not impacted and sellers are not impacted. And again, it's just quite limited options in the short run to impact your cost structure. Most companies would delay shipment or incur -- add fees or something. We don't think that is customer-centric nor productive. And we will get through this period and then we are committed to getting our cost structure down.\nDave Fildes: And Brian, on that second question around the physical store strategy. We - of course, we have a number of different brands in store types, Whole Foods being the largest that's got over 500 locations, where we've got Amazon 4-star, Amazon Books, the Fresh Grocery stores, Amazon Go and Amazon Pop Ups. And each one of course has a name and the types of products they offer has its own differences. But I think when you step back, we've said that we want options for customers to be able to shop online and in-store. And I think you're seeing that probably most predominantly with the grocery offerings in the Whole Foods footprint that we've got out there. And we want to give customers choice and offer them the combination doing that online and in-store option, whatever works best. And the goal around this is really raise the bar for what customers can expect with this omni-channel experience. So, if you like the hybrid model and we're working on continuing to evolve on a lot of interesting in-store experiences that will resonate with customers. We know that customers like to have a choice to be able to do that. So, some of the things that we continue to be excited about and do a lot of work on are things like the Just Walk Out Technology, that's been in our Amazon Go stores and has now moved into some of our Amazon Fresh stores, just really eliminates, again, one of those things that people may not realize is such a hassle or a deterrent to shopping, waiting in line, and eliminating something that\u2019s really been positively received by customers as they use that technology. Another one, just as you enter these stores, there's technology we have now in a little over 70 of our physical retail stores like Amazon One, which is a contactless way for folks to enter stores using their palm to identify. So that's in, as I said, retail stores and Whole Foods stores. And so, keep looking for us to roll that out. And I\u2019d say with these technologies, too, there's opportunities beyond the Amazon physical store footprints that I mentioned. You're starting to see Just Walk Out going in sports and kind of large arena-type environments. And Amazon One is at some good locations. And both those technologies, I'm excited to employ them in Climate Pledge Arena here in Seattle. So, look for us to keep iterating on those and finding other new innovative ways for customers to enjoy unique shopping experience.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe if I can come back to two on the Q4 cost structure. Just in terms of framing it almost against a year-ago period, could you talk a little bit about the 4 billion of COVID costs from a year ago, the elements of EBIT contribution from things like AWS and third-party and advertising, and maybe help investors better understand the bridge between some of the elements of headwinds to profitability in Q4 versus Q4 a year ago. I appreciate all the comments upfront. I didn't know if we could go a little bit deeper. And then of the costs you're incurring late Q3 into Q4, how should investors think about a permanent nature to that cost structure versus a transient nature of the cost structure, either as an output of the macro environment or the unit environment in Q4? Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks, Eric, for your questions. I will just start with the second one. So how should we think about the cost permanence? Certainly, on the labor front there, we estimate about half of the cost is permanent base wage. The other half is in incentives that we currently offer to attract workers. We're going to have to see. I think it's going to adjust -- we are going to have to adjust and work to lower our costs going forward, especially on things that we procure that may have gone up in price in the last few months. Mostly what I\u2019m talking about is kind of third-party things like trucking and steel for fulfillment center construction. So, we will be working on our cost structure for a while. If you're trying to do the bridge for Q4 year-over-year, a couple of things I would say, yes, the COVID costs are lower by $1.5 billion versus last year.\nEric Sheridan: Q3, yes.\nBrian Olsavsky : Yes. If your Q4, excuse me, the 4 billion is going to be pure variance year-over-year. That's what we've identified, 2 billion roughly of labor inflation and 2 billion of operational disruption mostly through higher transportation costs. There are a couple of other items year-over-year. If you remember last year, we were running at nearly 100% capacity. That's not the ideal for us, but it has the benefit of being highly leveraged and can have other costs, but it's highly leveraged mathematically on a cost per unit shipped. As we get more into a normal buffer, so that we can handle swings in volumes, especially as we get closer to holiday cutoffs, but we generally run with more slack in the system. And we\u2019re kind of in a good fortunate for returning to maybe a more normal profile and space, this Q4 issues again on labor. So there's that. There's the increased cost in digital content, combination of video, games, music, audible. So, some rather large items year-over-year, having given you a complete bridge, but that's what we're seeing.\nDave Fildes: Yeah. I think that's right, $4 billion, the items you mentioned, $1 billion higher in content. Marketing costs, they were suppressed last year. For much of the year, you're starting to see those grow throughout 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Salmon: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions. First, you mentioned growing customers use of Prime, more original programming coming, and the services you offer, continuing to expand. Do you see this demand, this new content, the new services having expanded to a point where a price increase for the Prime subscription begins to make sense? And then second, you mentioned the unboxed event earlier this week, number of new ad products announced there. Which among them do you expect to be most impactful to the overall advertising business? Thanks, guys.\nBrian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks, Dan. I\u2019m going to start with the first question on Prime. So yes, we're very excited about the current programming that\u2019s coming out in the back-end of this year, and also the prospect for 2022. We think it's a real step-up in options and quality and volume for our customers globally in the video side and very excited about it. And you're right, it does have a lot of value. I've nothing to discuss or announce around Prime price increases. But we always look at that. We look at the value where it's generally a country-by-country discussion. We look at the value we\u2019ve built. We look at the time since our last price increase. There\u2019s a lot of strategic factors involved obviously. But the main job is to build the value of Prime, and that's what we work on and video is a big part of that.\nDave Fildes: Yes. And, Dan, on the second piece for advertising, I think, we still see there's a lot of opportunity in the biggest kind of bucket, if you will, of the current advertising revenue run rate. And that's in the sponsored activity that we're able to offer up to customers, continuing to find ways to just measure that information and be able to surface it credibly and quickly improve on that for advertisers out there. So, a lot of work and it's still being done on the team there and being able to add value for customers. I\u2019d point to, there's a lot of excitement in the of video advertising area, I know we've talked about that in the past. It's growing quickly. It's not the biggest piece of that run rate that you see in there, but growing well. And I think just the technology, we're able to develop some of the relationships that we've been able to foster with things like live sports, the opportunities with the Fire TV device and the video community and where we can reach folks through those areas, it's really exciting. IMDb TV, our ad-supported channel is - continues to do really well. People really enjoy that. We recently expanded that beyond the U.S. for the first time to the UK. So, a lot of really good and interesting ideas and a lot of opportunities to grow in different ways with video.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Just two for me. So, you guys are always kind of beating the rest of e-commerce on speed of delivery across a wide set of SKUs, but there's a bunch of these new companies cropping up that are wiring up speedy same-day delivery for a lot of products from either their own warehouse or from various other retailers. Do you view that as a threat? And you have same-day offering in 15 cities. Does your same-day leverage kind of your existing fulfillment center footprint or do you have to kind of rethink the approach to get the speed down to that 30-minute window or wherever it's going to go? And the second question is just New World was a huge hit. So just any thoughts high-level on the overall strategy within gaming? Thanks.\nDave Fildes: Yeah. I'll take the second question first related to games. So, I think as we mentioned at the top, really excited to get New World out there to more customers' hands and saw some really good momentum kind of an engagement coming out of the gate with customers there and some of the offerings like the Steam platform and Twitch as well. But if you step back, I think, look, we've said for a while now that gaming is obviously one of the fastest-growing industries in the entertainment space. And we find and see a number of different ways to be able to offer some folks a variety of services. So, we developed and published games for customers through Amazon Games, which developed that New World. We're also leveraging the Flywheel -- the Amazon Flywheel, offering some exclusive and free content as part of Prime Gaming, so it\u2019s part of Prime benefits. You've got AWS, utilizing AWS servers to stream games with our Luna -- Amazon Luna offering. And then as I mentioned before, building this large, engaged, passionate gaming community online with Twitch. So, I think, again, kind of to my point about a lot of really interesting ideas when we're talking about video and the advertising space, it's a lot of different areas that can interrelate, serve different communities within the gaming area. And so, we're going to keep working on that, keep building and listening to customers on the games we've launched, and keep pushing forward with an exciting slate in the future.\nBrian Olsavsky: And then your first question on what I'll call ultra-fast delivery and other options in the market. We like our model. It's a rapidly evolving space. And obviously, we\u2019re customer-obsessed, but we also are competitor aware. We like the business that we have. We have over 170,000 products that customers, Prime customers can get within two hours from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and other stores that participate with us in over 5,000 cities and towns. So, we're well on our way to providing ultra-fast delivery for things that require ultra-fast, or things like groceries and others. And we see that expanding, but there will be room for multiple winners in the space. And as we say, there's -- you have to have a cost structure and a logistics network that will pay for the delivery over time. So, we see it as part of an offering that we offer to customers that ranges from two days to one day to two hours or one hour, in some cases. So, we like to meet customers where they are and when they need things, and we're working on speed consistently.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. On the advertising business, I'm curious, given some of the concerns in the supply chain, have you seen a pullback on the ad side? So far, is that something that you're factoring in for the fourth quarter?\nBrian Olsavsky : No. We're actually -- again, we're seeing strong growth. Obviously, the Prime Day is always a really great advertising event as well. And then you saw a little bit of that in Q2 when we had Prime Day in Q2 this year and we're lapping Prime Day from Q4 of last year. So, there might be comparable issues, but as far as the strength of the offering and the differential between the growth of the advertising business versus the unit growth, we think we're really resonating with advertisers. We're given new products, new ways to advertise, new ways to highlight the brands. It\u2019s resonating with sellers as well for the same reasons. And we feel it's additive to the customer experience. It helps customers find curated selection and also see brands that they may not have otherwise seen. Dave Fildes Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-07-29 20:51:07", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the amazon.com Q2 2021 Financial Results, Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 29,2021, only, and will include Forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors. detailed in our filings with the SEC.  This guidance also reflects our estimates to-date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce, staffing, and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain.  Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. Before we get to Q&A, I'd like to first thank all of our Prime members, our vendors, our 3P sellers, and my Amazon colleagues, especially the Worldwide Ops team, for a record-breaking Prime Day in June. Third-party sellers, who are mostly comprised of small- and medium-sized businesses, were a big contributor to Prime Day 's success. The Prime Day event was the biggest two-day period ever for these SMBs in our stores, and our 3P revenue continued to grow significantly faster than our online stores revenue.  Third-party units represented 56% of our total paid units in Q2, up from a 53% mix one year ago. Our second quarter net sales were $113 billion or at about the midpoint of our guidance range. That\u2019s a year-over-year increase of 27% or 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and included the shift of Prime Day into Q2 this year, which added about 400 basis points to the year-over-year growth rate. Q2 of this year was a transition period for many of our customers. As the quarter progressed, people were at home less as restrictions and lockdowns eased in some of our largest geographies, including the U.S. and much of Europe.  As a result, while Prime members continued to spend more with us, growth in Prime members spend moderated compared to spending seen during the peak of the pandemic. As you look at our recent revenue growth rates, I want to give you some insight into what we are seeing as there have been some noticeable intra-quarter changes in our revenue run rate. Prime Day has also been in three different quarters the past three years, so I will normalize for this impact in my growth rate comments.  Also since FX rates have bounced around, all of my comments exclude foreign exchange. Here\u2019s a quick recap of our growth rates in 2020 and 2021. First, before COVID-19, we've been growing at a revenue growth rate close to 20%. 2019 full-year growth was 22%, and revenue growth for the first two months of 2020 was 21%. Once the pandemic hit and lockdowns began in March 2020, the initial growth rate jumped into the mid-30% range. Q1 of last year ended with a revenue growth rate of 27%. However, our operations network took time to step up to serve this growth in demand due to space constraints and our need to ramp up hiring quickly while prioritizing employee health and safety.  By mid-May of last year, we have made good progress to open up more capacity by adding hundreds of thousands of employees. This allowed our revenue growth rate to jump to the 35% to 45% range and remained at that level through Q1 of this year when we had 41% growth. In Q2 of this year, we began to comp this high sales period from last year, and the year-over-year revenue growth rate has narrowed. It has also narrowed as vaccines become more readily available in many countries and people are getting out of their homes.  Since May 15, again, excluding Prime Day, our year-over-year growth rate has dropped into the mid-teens. Our Q3 revenue guidance range of 10% to 16% growth reflects an expected continuation of this trend. Given all this volatility, it is useful to consider the 2-year compounded annual growth rate, which remained strong in the 25% to 30% range. Recall, this compares to our pre-pandemic growth rate of 21%. This reflects the acceleration of Prime membership and Prime member purchase levels over the past 18 months. While I'm not giving forward guidance beyond Q3 of this year, we do expect this pattern of difficult year-over-year revenue comps to continue for the next few quarters. As we move forward and start to comp COVID 's impact on our revenue growth, we encourage you to also look at the multiyear compounded annual growth rate since the onset of the pandemic to better put this growth in perspective. Now, back to the Q2 highlights. We continue to be very pleased with the Prime member growth and engagement we're seeing. We've been fortunate to welcome more than 50 million new members in the past 18 months, and Prime member benefits usage remains high.  That includes continued strong engagement in Prime's family of digital offerings, like Prime Video's original movies. For example, Prime members helped make The Tomorrow War and Tom Clancy's Without Remorse, the number one streaming movies on their respective opening weekends. Amazon Advertising is innovating at a fast clip, launching over 40 new features and self-service capabilities in the quarter, making it easier for sellers, companies, and authors to grow their businesses by helping customers discover their brands and products.  Other revenue increased 83% year-over-year in Q2, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven largely by continued acceleration in our ads business. Moving on to AWS, revenue growth accelerated across a broad range of customers. We see strong growth in enterprises, governments, educational, and research institutions, and our start-up and digital native customers.  We recently announced new commitments and migrations from customers across a diverse set of major industries, including Swisscom and Bell Canada in Telecom, BMO Financial Group, and Bancolombia in financial services, and Ferrari in automotive. AWS customers recognize that the move to the cloud is very positive for their businesses in the medium and long term. Disruptive economic events like COVID have caused many people to step back and think about how they want to change strategically, and many have come to the conclusion that they do not want to own and run their own datacenters. They assume they can save money and gain agility and innovation by moving to AWS.  I'll finish up with some comments on our ongoing investments in operations. As we think about the pull-forward in demand we've seen these past 18 months, it has required and will continue to require a significant amount of investment in our fulfillment network. Our teams have done a remarkable job stepping up to serve customers and support our vendors and sellers, and we've worked hard to increase capacity at a rapid rate. For the trailing 12 months ended Q2, Capex and equipment finance leases increased 74% versus the prior trailing 12-month period.  And as usual, most of our 2021 spend and building openings are planned in the second half of this year. This is all part of a multi-year investment cycle for us. Unit volumes, while obviously growing at lower rates of last year's large comp continue to remain high, and we see strong demand for FBA and third-party sellers. So, there's more work to do, including additional build-outs of our FCs, as well as our middle mile and last-mile capabilities to support our fast-improving delivery offers for customers.  I encourage you to read the business highlights in our press release. It's a diverse collection of efforts supported by many thousands of customer-focused Amazon employees, from Amazon Pharmacy to Business Prime to to AWS' plans to add seven new regions to NFL Thursday Night Football starting next year, to the Black Business Accelerator program, to Alexa\u2019s collaboration with Ford Motor Company. We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. [Operator instructions] Please hold while we poll for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I just want to ask two, just going back to the 2Q revenue beyond Prime spend moderating and the reopening, is there anything else you'd point to, in particular, that they have kept you in the middle of the range versus obviously where you've been over the last year versus expectations? And I guess, in particular, can you talk about Prime Day relative to your expectations? And then secondly, the BigCommerce partnership, a couple weeks ago, you seem to have opened up more to working with merchants away from Amazon. Just hoping you could talk more about the multichannel fulfillment opportunity, and do you think you now have the logistics capabilities, and has everything recovered to the point where you can offer these services more to third parties? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks, Doug. Now as far as Q2 run rate is concerned, if you look back the last few quarters, we've not done a great job of nailing the impact of COVID. We have generally over-performed our guidance range. I think last quarter we had kept the same process coming off some very high volumes for the last prior four quarters.  And really, the only difference I see is in Q2 versus Q1, and before is the year-over-year comp, which we had factored in, but also the increase in mobility. I think the impact of people getting vaccinated and getting out in the world, not only shopping offline, but also living life and getting out.  It takes away from shopping time. It's good -- it's a good phenomenon and it's great, and we just have to appropriately gauge our run-rate going forward. So, Prime Day was very successful. We passed the record set in last fall's Prime Day, which was a very different time of year to have Prime Day and started to bump up against early holiday shopping, so we're really pleased. And again, I think it was a great day then for third-party sellers as I pointed out.\nDave Fildes: Doug, on your second question, it's Dave here. I\u2019d just say our focus is really squarely on adding capacity to meet the current high customer demand that Brian talked about in his opening remarks. We're always working to develop new and innovative ways to support partners, SMBs in particular who sell on Amazon, and that includes testing shipping programs and newer initiatives that can help those businesses get packages to customers quickly and reliably. So, continue to see us look for ways to be able to innovate where it's appropriate relative to the customer demand we're already seeing in our network.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please, proceed with your question.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks very much, guys. I guess sort of masked in the headline results is actually pretty solid performance in the higher margin segments of the business, including third-party services, subscriptions, AWS, and advertising. and then I think that was evident in gross margin as well. I guess my question is whether there is any deliberate shift towards these services or is that just more of an output of somewhat weaker trends you saw after mid-May? And then secondly, is Prime Day still a once per year phenomenon or would you consider separate events spread out during the same year to capitalize on different seasonal trends? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. On the second question, I don't have anything to announce today. Our trend has been once a year. Of course, it's moved between quarters the last three years. So, that's all I have on that one. As far as the higher-margin areas and whether that's a purposeful strategy, I'd like to say it is, but if you look at what they are third-party is kind of a continuation of strength in our FBA program, in particular, I think the sellers are doing a great job of adding additional selection that's very valuable and reinforces our flywheel, and we'd like to see that and you see that third-party percent of units went up from 53% last year to 56%, and that's a steady mark.  We've seen that, as we said, the third-party sellers are doing a great job and we like to see that. On advertising, advertising is, again, another part of our flywheel. We have traffic coming in for the consumer business. And if we do a good job with advertising, we'll make it an additive experience for our customers and our sellers and vendors.  So that's what we work on, is to make sure that it's a relevant experience and adds to your shopping experience and helps you find selection that perhaps you wouldn't have found otherwise or it would've been harder to. And then on AWS, AWS is again, its own separate part of the business. It has been 15 years in the development, and we think our scale and experience really pays dividends.  If you looked at the last quarter, AWS set more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year than any quarter in our history. We are now at $59 billion annualized run-rate business, and that's up from 43 billion at this time last year. So, those are output measures as we like to say, the input measures are doing a good job on products, adding new capabilities, and being able to work with our customers to solve their problems.  I think that's what you are seeing and it's matching up well with a renewed emphasis on getting to the cloud by a lot of companies out there. And when they're looking to make that transition, it's giving up control and putting yourself in -- and choosing a partner for the long haul, and we're proud that companies choose us for that journey.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I've two, one a little nitpicky and one kind of big picture. The nitpicky on, Brian, fulfillment on a per unit basis was pretty high in the second quarter given -- relative to normal seasonality. Can you talk about just what's driving that? Is that a new build, new square feet, or are there inefficiencies that went on in the quarter in fulfillment.  And the second one is sort of about bigger picture. In the last quarter, you talked a little bit about same-day in Europe. There\u2019s been some headlines about same-day. How do we think -- how should we think about a larger same-day offering being part of the investment process right now, just to sort of maintain and grow your share of grocery and consumables? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks. Yes, I would say on the fulfillment side, there are a number of things. First, we are adding a lot of capacity. If you step back, the Amazon fulfilled unit volume, so that's the units coming out of our fulfillment centers both retail and FBA have doubled in the past 2 years. And the AMZL, the delivery arm of our business, has more than doubled in that time period. So, you can see there's been very strong multiyear demand here that we're still catching up with from last year. So most of -- I mentioned earlier our year-over-year growth in CapEx and equipment leases is 74% in the second -- at the end of June compared to 38% the year before.  So, we're continuing to add and most of that development is really ahead of us in the second half of the year. So, if you've been with us a long time, you know, the cadence is that as we add demand -- excuse me, as we add capacity, there's a lot of additional costs from hiring to starting up to training, to getting that building or sort center or delivery station up and running. It usually takes a multi-year period to tame those assets.  And we've literally nearly doubled our network here in the last 18 months from a size standpoint. There's a lot of that going on, a lot of strong effort by our fulfillment and ops teams to help mitigate the costs. The other thing is wage pressure has become evident, we've talked about this a bit.  The wage increase for -- that we normally would do in October, we pulled forward into May. We're spending a lot of money on signing and incentives. And while we have very good staffing levels, it's not without cost. It's very competitive labor market out there, and certainly the biggest contributor to inflationary pressures that we're seeing in business.\nDave Fildes: Brian, on the second point just around speed, as we've talked about many times, customers respond well to the fast, high-quality delivery and of course, back in 2019, we were talking at that time about expanding the one-day delivery in the U.S. in the Europe, one-day delivery as part of Prime in most of those are sizable European countries where we operate has been standard for many years.  We're investing in the transportation network to support the demands, a significant part of the capital investments we've been talking about for the past few years, and certainly since the pandemic's start, has been to support those efforts in middle and last mile capacity to keep pace and support with that demand. So as we [Indiscernible] here that work's not done yet. We're continuing to expand.  You'll see that investment throughout 2021. And that growing transportation network will support faster delivery times for customers. One-day delivery is improving and -- in the U.S. as well as same-day delivery, where it makes sense and where the network is growing there. So we'll have to continue to see how we go, but we are focused on those data points. And we're also focused on improving delivery precision as a way of improving the quality of -- of the overall offering.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nYoussef Squali: Thank you very much. I have two questions. One, within online stores, was there any particular area of softness during the quarter? I'm just thinking about maybe some product categories that may have come back, or actually the opposite, may have gone down, the demand for with the reopening that you can maybe highlight.  And then as you look beyond Q3 and Q4, what kind of growth assumptions for e-commerce or just in general for the next couple of years, are you guys working with to build your budget and events against the opportunity? I'm just thinking, are you guys assuming that e-commerce growth remains or it goes back to pre - COVID levels or stays at an elevated level, [Indiscernible] Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the online store's revenue. You're probably looking at a growth rate of 13% in Q2 versus the revenue growth -- FX-neutral revenue growth rate of 24%. I would point you back to last year in Q2. At that online stores grew 49%, there were restrictions on what we stocked in our warehouses. And as you remember, we had to constrain space for a lot third-party sellers as well as our retail offering. But the mix shifted for the early part of Q2 last year to be more of a retail mix and then MFN mix, and then it flip back to be more balanced mix that you've seen in the past.  On forward investment, here's how I would explain it. Again, we are sitting here with demand volumes that have gone up on an Amazon Fulfilled Network basis. It's doubled in the 2-year period. So we are not back to where we want to be on a number of dimensions. We handled Q4 last year, we've been playing catch-up pretty much since the pandemic started. But what suffered is space and space constraints. And that's -- it's gotten better, but it was a factor last year.  And also our one-day delivery percentage has dropped and has not returned to levels seeing pre-pandemic in the United States, It's on par and getting better than pre-pandemic in Europe. But in the United States, while it's improving, it still hasn't reached the pre-pandemic level. So we have a lot of growth to do there. As far as the stickiness of purchases. I think there's certainly a number of things that were purchased last year that didn't repeat for a lot of retailers.  Things like consumables early on, gloves, cleaning supplies, computer monitors, some things you use to outfit your house. You can probably go through your own checklist of purchases and say, okay, I probably will not do this every year. But there has been a healthy movement to online commerce. We have -- we've added Prime members, and the Prime members that we have have ratcheted up their purchases with us, which was always part of the plan and a good sign. It means we're offering them more things that they can buy and satisfying more their demand needs.  Even in Q2, when, and as I said, rates are starting to moderate, in the quarter, those Prime member purchases still grew year-over-year on a -- per Prime member basis they just didn't grow at the same cliff that they had in the prior 3 or 4 quarters. So that's a good sign. And we like the engagement levels and the retention levels that we see with Prime members.  So all-in-all very positive story on that front has accelerated the model quite a bit. There's just, again, some comparison issues that we'll just have to realize and perhaps look at a 2-year compound annual growth rate for a period of time to judge where we are on that progress because there's been a lot of ins and outs, especially with Prime Day moving around. So hopefully that answers your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Ju: Thank you so much. Brian, it seems like the pandemic has touched off what looks like a greater urgency among SMBs to accelerate their presence online, and I was wondering if your third-party marketplaces' platform is seeing perhaps a faster influx of more sellers or emerging brands. And following up on the labor market commentary there, do you think you will see any incremental headwinds hiring the necessary people for performance centers this year? Thanks.\nDave Fildes: Stephen, it's Dave. I'll take that first question just around SMBs and behavior. I think, look, it's -- we've seen a 20-year progression in terms of building out the services that we thought were resonated with us and our business, but also saw very early on to externalize those services and offerings to sellers and particularly, small-medium size businesses over time.  Obviously, noteworthy with FBA and many other features. And so I think this -- what you see is really just a continuation of that effort put out by the teams around, whether it's logistics, brand representation. More recently. in recent years with some of the advertising features, we've been able to develop surface, for all our selling partners. And so I think that's a big area and a big part of commitment.  I don't know that I [Indiscernible] anything specifically in the near term other than to say that we should continue to see great momentum on a units basis as we give that metric every quarter, about 56% of our overall total paid units, are third-party. That's up about 300 basis points year-over-year. So, expect for us to continue to put forth that effort in FBA around the world. for sellers and some of these other SMB features continue to gain momentum there.\nBrian Olsavsky: And on the labor comment, we can't predict too far in the future. We've got labor estimate in our Q3 guidance, I would say it's a bit of a complicated mix of economic growth and industries opening up, government payments in some areas that may impact people's working, and then whether or not children are at back at school fully in the fall. So there's a lot of dynamics we do count on having more employees in Q3 and Q4, as you know, from our ramp up to the holidays. So I would I would probably count on wage pressure remaining for the immediate future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP. Please proceed with your question.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on just international operating income. that's -- if you look at the results, it's now producing consistently positive results here. And so can you talk to us a little bit more? Just talk to us a little bit more about what's driving that. Is this the result of most major builds are now complete, and you're seeing the efficiencies in fulfillment centers, and so we should see this trend continue or is there something else that's driving international operating income? Just remaining positive here. Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Ron, thanks for your question. Yes, we have had strong international results in the last five quarters or so. Noticeably, the positive operating income, which had not been the trend prior to Q2 of last year. I would say the major factors here are the acceleration of growth, so we've in some ways put the set 2 years out - growth on top of today's assets. That's a lot of stress, but it's a lot of leverage of the assets that we have.  And as we've talked about before, our fulfillment centers and operations have been running pretty much at peak since May of last year. It's starting to mitigate a bit, but it's a strong undercurrent. But having said that, we continue to invest in international expansion. You may have noticed that we added Portugal as a Prime country last quarter. We have investments in Brazil, and India, and the Middle East and a number of countries. So we continue to add new countries.  We have a strong performance in our more established countries like Europe and Japan. And so it's a bit of a mixed bag, but right now, again, the performance is very strong. The foreign exchange rate has been favorable as well last few quarters. So that has helped. But really pleased with the performance of our international teams.  And we'll see again it -- our investment plans -- our plans are to make money, obviously in the long run. But we have forward advanced Prime benefits in a lot of these countries before they would have been able to see them. and if they have run the same trajectory as we did in the U.S. so there's bit of forward investment on Prime benefits, especially things like video, that resonate with customers and are good for the Prime program, and turn into eventually really strong businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. So maybe one on Amazon then a follow-up. So Amazon -- sorry, AWS. So you saw 10% sequential growth in the quarter, you saw that also in the fourth duarter, was there anything around reopening that made second quarter AWS exceptionally strong and that we should kind of keep in mind going forward, or do we feel like this was kind of a normal quarter for kind of AWS and this is a kind of a good cadence for the business. And then just a follow-up, just -- maybe your your point about the ability to kind of keep up. Is there any kind of throttling of FBA that's going on, just because you don't have the capacity or to -- or you are trying to say that you might be losing share to other sellers who can promise to get an item to customers faster, given still some of the challenges with logistics and last mile and everything. Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Hi, Jason. Thank you. Let me start with that second question. No, my comments were really about throttling of space last year which did impact -- it impacted our vendors and our retail business as well as our third-party business, probably more pronounced in Q2 of last year, especially April and into early May as we are working to get fully staffed in a help -- helpful and safe way, and also build out more capacity.  In Q4, again, we're handling volumes that were somewhat unheard of year-over-year. Our Q4 growth rate was 42%. That's usually not the case, and it's magnified at peak when we're already handling the highest volumes of the year. All I was trying to say was that our space planning and if you will, throttling of space for their price was not something we like to do. We don't think we're the only ones who had that issue. And that's why we're building out our networks so quickly in our minds.  It's hard to do quickly. but we're moving as quickly as possible. And again, we have a lot of new capacity being added in the second half of the year. On AWS growth, if you look at the run rate in last year, we had 33% growth rate in Q1 and it dropped to 29, 29, and 28 the last 3 quarters.  There's always a lot of year-over-year things going on, but we do note that last year there was a lot of effort by companies to limit their spend and operate more efficiently as as we're all plunged into an unknown demand curve and some industries who were hurt worse than others.  If you remember, we worked -- we actually worked very hard with our customers to help them lower their demand for AWS services as best we could to match any new demand patterns. We also help [Indiscernible] scale very quickly. Companies like [Indiscernible], Netflix and others were very help -- glad that AWS was there to help them scale to meet volume very quickly, so there's a lot of mixed bag there.  We think that it was a strong performance for this quarter. We can see good trends with new contracts and new clients that are either signing up with AWS and making the journey to the Cloud or accelerating their journey to the Cloud, or setting up new longer-term contracts with us.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post: Great. A couple. No one's really mentioned the CEO change. So I was wondering if it is not on the call but any change in direction, investment philosophies, or any -- more integration of AWS, or anything that we should be aware of related to that change? And then second, AWS margins, really strong revenues. The margins came down quarter-over-quarter. Can you just remind us of what drives some of that margin fluctuation? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the second one. So again, at any point in time, there's a lot of cross pressures in the operating margins of AWS. There's growth which helps us leverage our assets. There's increasing the efficiency of our servers and efficiency of our sales force. Those are all positives. On the flipside, there's price decreases, there's new contracts signed with large players for multiple years. So there's pricing pressure. There's also the expansion of the sales force and building infrastructure to add new regions globally.  So as we said, these margins are going to bounce around. We're happy with the Q2 margins. I would note that there was a negative impact from foreign exchange that was about 150 basis points. But even at 28.3, it's a strong margin for this business. We know it's going to bounce around as we invest, but also worked very hard to scale our businesses in and efficiently run our assets. on the leadership change.  It's your -- expect Andy, he's hit the ground, running. He's continuing to have a very high bar for customer experience. high standards, operational excellence, inventiveness, willingness to fail, and everything else that Amazon is known for internally and externally. I think we've had a good handoff. Jeff, of course, is moving into Executive Chairman role and he will not be leaving.  He is obviously continuing to be very involved in, as we say, the 1-way door decisions. We've also had a good leadership change at AWS with Adam Selipsky coming in. Adam himself comes with a lot of Amazon history and knowledge and external CEO experience that has made him even stronger as he comes back.  So we feel really good about the transition. And of course, don't expect any drop and expect Andy to add his unique brand of positive attitude and optimism in forward-looking focus to help Amazon keep going and delighting customers.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-04-29 23:15:06", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2021 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020.  Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 29, 2021 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.  During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.  This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity; workforce staffing and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain.  Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. Before we get to Q&A, I will touch upon a few highlights from the first quarter of the year. Let me start by highlighting the momentum we are seeing in AWS. In the first quarter, AWS revenue growth accelerated across a broad range of customers. During COVID, we've seen many enterprises decide that they no longer want to manage their own technology infrastructure. They see that partnering with AWS and moving to the cloud gives them better cost, better capability and better speed of innovation. We expect this trend to continue as we move into the post-pandemic recovery.  There's significant momentum around the world, including broad and deep engagement across major industries. For example, last quarter, we announced new commitments and migrations from some of the world's most renowned sports leagues, the National Hockey League, the PGA Tour, Formula 1 and the German Bundesliga.  We continue to expand our AWS infrastructure footprint to support the strong growth we're seeing. AWS offers 80 availability zones across 25 geographic regions around the world. And we've announced plans to launch 15 more availability zones in five more regions. Turning to the consumer business, we continue to see strong customer demand globally in the first quarter. Revenue growth in our international segment grew 50% on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year in Q1 as restrictive regional and national lockdowns were in place throughout the quarter, particularly in the UK and Europe. In North America, revenue growth of 39%, largely reflects the continuation of demand trends that we have seen since the early months of the pandemic. Third-party sellers were largely comprised of small- and medium-sized businesses, continue to see strong sales and serve more customers. Our 3P seller services revenue increased 60% on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year in the first quarter, growing significantly faster than online stores revenue. Third-party units represented 55% of our total paid units in Q1, up from 52% in Q1 of last year.  Prime members also continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic. These trends have also extended to Prime's digital benefits. Over the past 12 months, Prime Video streaming hours were up over 70% year-over-year. Amazon Studio had its best award season yet, and Prime members can look forward to a strong slate of upcoming original series and films featuring an impressive group of diverse talent and creators. We're also continuing to expand our roster of live sports content, and we're excited to partner with the NFL and be the exclusive home of NFL Thursday Night Football into the next decade.  Twitch is also seeing great momentum. Hours watched on Twitch nearly doubled year-over-year in the first quarter, and we now average more than 35 million daily visitors. Another popular benefit of Prime membership is Prime Day, and we are excited to announce that we will hold the two-day savings event during the second quarter. Prime Day is also a great opportunity for our selling partners to reach more customers, and will make supporting small businesses a big focus again this year. We'll have more to share on Prime Day, including the event dates a bit later this quarter. We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees. In the U.S., Amazon has held on-site vaccination events in 29 states, reaching more than 300,000 frontline employees and contractors. We are watching events closely in Europe and in particular, India, where we have put in place employee initiatives, from medical health lines, teleconsulting, hotel rooms for quarantining and financial support, as well as donating 100 ICU ventilator units to local hospitals. We'll continue to invest in the health and safety of our employees and delivery partners, particularly in our global fulfillment and logistics operations.  And finally, to summarize our financial results. Total revenue of $108.5 billion came in above the guidance range of $100 billion to $106 billion. In addition to our strong segment results, advertising revenue within the North America and international segments also accelerated during the quarter. The leverage we are seeing on this higher revenue, combined with strong operational performance led to higher operating income as well.  Operating income of $8.9 billion in Q1 was above our guidance range of $3 billion to $6.5 billion. We incurred a little less than the $2 billion in COVID-19-related operating costs that we had projected in the first quarter. We continue to incur these costs across our global fulfillment network as we maintain social distancing measures, which impacts our productivity and as we make direct investments in employee safety. Looking ahead, we expect to incur approximately $1.5 billion in COVID-19-related operating costs in the second quarter.  Lastly, I'd like to congratulate and thank our employees for making Amazon #1 in the U.S. on LinkedIn's 2021 top companies ranking, an annual list identifying the most sought-after places to work. We appreciate the customer obsession and passion for innovation from teams across the company to make Amazon a great place to work. With that, let's move on to Q&A. \nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Thanks, Brian. A question on last-mile delivery. So you guys are investing pretty aggressively to build out that Amazon control last-mile fulfillment. We see the blue vans driving around everywhere in the Bay Area, so congrats on that. So I guess the question is, how long until you feel like if that's in the right place as far as all your major metros where you want to set that up. And at what stage, does the unit cost of shipping start to improve from these initiatives? And I guess, high level, is controlling the last mile allowing you to further penetrate or gain market share in certain categories where speedy delivery is of the essence. Can you talk about that, please? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Ross, thanks for your questions. Yes, let me start with last mile in general. So we're investing heavily. We talked about it last year, our fulfillment, including Amazon Logistics investment, we increased our capacity by 50%. And you can see from our CapEx numbers, the CapEx, including infrastructure, of course, increased to 80% in the trailing 12 months over the prior trailing 12 months. So certainly, a large area of investment, not only fulfillment centers, but also two elements of transportation, what we call the middle mile where we're putting sort centers, Amazon Air, line haul, trailers, think of all the intermediate movements between our warehouses and our final delivery stations. And then that last mile was just delivery stations, DSP and seeing our delivery service partners as well.  So you talked about costs. We actually think our cost right now is very competitive with our external options, and we measure that very closely. It certainly gets better with demand and amortization and route density, et cetera. But we see, which is very helpful, is the ability to control the whole flow of products from the warehouse to the end customer. Its churn would -- normally was a batch process where we would hand off a large batch of orders to a third-party once a day, let's say, to a continuous flow process, where we continually have orders leaving our warehouses five, six times a day going through middle mile and then to final delivery, either through our AMZL drivers or DSP partners.  So that gives us a lot of ability not only to control the flow of the product, but also flow of information. We're seeing a lot of progress in that area. And I think you'll see it, too, as a customer where you're starting to get more precise estimates of delivery. You'll get notes that say, hey, you're eight stops away from your delivery, et cetera. Because everyone's busy. A big part of delivery is actually being there sometimes when you need to get -- be there for the delivery. Other times, Of course, you can just have it put on your doorstep and get to it later. But that's -- we see a lot of benefit from that. We also see that there's a lot of cutoff times that we can extend, again, because we pretty much have perfect information between the order placement allocation to warehouses where we're going to pick and box up the product and send it on its way. So lots of advantages. We are continuing to invest, and we'll see a large investment in this area through 2021 as well.  We do think that it may also spill to 2022. That should set us up in really good stead with our capacity. And already, the majority of our units are going through AMZL today.\nDave Fildes: This is David, Ross. Just to add to that, Ryan touched upon it, but there are an important part of this last-mile effort has been the program we've had, the -- Brian called this -- mentioned the delivery services partner program, or the DSP, it's an important part of the last-mile network. And that -- just as a reminder, that employs more than 100,000 drivers, and it's been growing for the past few years. And it's really -- it's a program with an incentive for those folks to become small business owners and start their own package delivery business. So it's a great way for those folks to access the delivery technology and the package volumes we have and tapping on the network. And we've got a lot of really cool elements as part of that program, grant programs to support entrepreneurs and minority groups and really help them build out and helps us support a diverse business community as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. On AWS, I'm curious if you could give us a backlog number. And there have been a lot of questions about the incredible backlog strength you've seen in the last several quarters, and it finally seems that you're seeing the conversions between that backlog growth and now revenue growth accelerating. If you could just comment a little more on that conversion and how you expect it to trend? Thank you.\nDave Fildes: Yes, hey Brent, it's Dave. I think it's -- the backlog growth, just to give you the figures for March 31, it's $52.9 billion. The weighted average life is about where we've been for the past several quarters, so about -- a little over three years in terms of the weighted average remaining life. So that's up about 55% right now. So it really continues to be really strong and really pleased with that. I think that's backlog figures, but also just the revenue growth and the momentum we're seeing in here is a lot of hard work and innovation on the teams and growing teams and reaching out and working with those. And so you can expect to continue to see customers making these long-term commitments. We think it's a representation you think of a lot of companies that have worked with us, been engaged with us, been with us. And as they get better comfort line of sight with what they want to do and as we are able to add even more value and services, it's just a great partnership and a relationship that they want to build with us over those multi-year periods.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nYoussef Squali: Thank you very much. Maybe just a two-part question. First, Brian, you touch upon this a little bit in your prepared remarks about the acceleration in international growth. Can you maybe just speak to the drivers there? And in, particularly in markets where COVID is no longer a major issue, have you seen any particular declines or maybe just slowdown in e-commerce demand or a decline in growth? It seems like they're going in different directions in Europe, for instance, it seems like the -- a lot of these markets are still very much under lockdown, yet your international business has grown pretty significantly. I don't know if there is positive or negative correlation. Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Thanks, Youssef. Yes, I would say we're seeing strength pretty much across the board in international. And it does vary by country. But if you just step back a minute, on an - even on an FX-neutral basis, we grew 50% in the quarter. We grew 50% last quarter, although that's aided by the fact that Prime Day was in Q4 this year. But if you look at the growth rate prior to COVID and post-COVID, in the international segment, on a -- even on an FX-neutral basis, has been tripling their prior growth rate in revenue anyway. So very strong and probably advancement of the model in a lot of countries by a year or more. And we're really pleased that we've been able to show our value to those customers, not only with our shipments and our ability to deliver and get them what they need to survive in homes in place during the pandemic, but also the strength that we've seen in the digital offering and the adoption of video, music, our devices. So it's really -- and we're forward investing, as you know, in that, in international with a lot of those Prime benefits. So it's really -- it's good to see as the underlying consumer shipping business, part of it grows, that we're still seeing healthy engagement and growing engagement. So I don't have a downside case yet. In fact, surprised a bit by the growth. I don't think we normally would have forecasted 50% growth in Q1. And certainly stressing our operations. But I would -- my hat's off to the operations team, they handled the volumes in Q1 very efficiently. Costs were very much under control. We started to see strong leverage of our fixed assets, especially our fulfillment center and transportation assets.\nDave Fildes: And this is Dave. And just these aren't big contributors by any means to the growth numbers Brian was talking about. But I think along with those efforts in countries we've been in for some period of time. We're continuing to open up new regions. If you look back, Poland recently opened up in March, Sweden opened up in the fourth quarter of last year. And even in some regions that we've been in for a few years, places like Turkey, we launched Prime in the back half of last year. So there's a lot of good effort and thought going into -- by the teams to continue kind of taking what we're learning in each of these geographies and feeding it back into a local presence to take advantage of everything we've learned with Prime and the broader consumer-facing experience.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nEd Yruma: You guys clearly took some market share with delivery and grocery during the pandemic. Just wondering how -- what the consumer behavior has been post -- is it proving to be sticky? And just kind of zooming out, talking about grocery broadly, how the fresh store's performed?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Grocery has been a great revelation during the post-pandemic period here. I think people really value the ability to get home delivery. And we've seen that as numbers go up considerably pre and post-pandemic. So -- but we've also worked very hard to increase our capacity during that time period. In the United States, we're delivering out of our Whole Foods stores, and we've engaged -- we'll be allowed to pick up a greater expansion of pickup at Whole Foods stores. Amazon Fresh became a free Prime benefit, as you know, in the late part of 2019. And customers really adopted it and continue to see strong growth. So I think on the fresh stores, it's a little too early. The stores themselves, we're confident that the Just Walk Out technology that will be a boon, a benefit to customers. And we're very excited about what's in the works, but that's still really early in day 1.\nDave Fildes: Yes. And it's -- we've got -- Ed, this is Dave. We've got about 12 fresh stores right now that are open, and we've confirmed. We've got some additional ones coming in, Southern California and Illinois, New Jersey and then here with us in the Seattle area. So as Brian said, really pleased with the start -- the technology and the feedback from the customers so far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.\nJohn Blackledge: Great. Two questions. The 2Q revenue guide range was strong, despite the initial pandemic comps. Could you just discuss demand levels you're seeing on the e-commerce side, and just other kind of key drivers of strong expected revenue growth in the second quarter. And then on the advertising business, if you can just talk about some of the key drivers of the acceleration. I think it, it feels like it's maybe the third quarter in a row of acceleration. So what's kind of driving that? And how should we think about the trajectory for the business as we round through the year?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, John. Let me start with your second question on advertising. So certainly, traffic has been a large driver of what we're seeing in the advertising space. But it discounts kind of the improvement that we're also seeing, relevancy and new products that the team is, has been rolling out, that the customers also enjoy. So I think the advertising team's done a great job of turning clicks into productive sales, and the advertising that results is valuable to us as well. We're using new deep learning models to show more relevant sponsored products. We continue to improve the relevancy of the ads being shown on the product detail pages. And we've seen rapid adoption of the video creative format for sponsored brands, among other things. So you're seeing a little bit more than just traffic. And again, very pleased with the performance of that team and of the receptiveness of our customers, our vendors, our authors and sellers to our advertising products. We think it's also very valuable for consumers as well, helping them find things more easily and discover new brands. On Q2 guidance, yes, I would say, we are projecting, again, continued strength across all of our segments. We -- I will remind you that Prime Day has been scheduled for later in Q2, and we'll have more on that as the quarter unfolds. So that's a consideration as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Just wanted to follow up there on Prime Day, Brian. Can you tell us at all just in terms of quantifying or just how you're thinking about the contribution within that 2Q guidance? And then also just on the rationale for timing, given historically in 3Q, we moved to 4Q last year and then now in 2Q. And then hoping you could also just talk about the Thursday Night Football deal, the strategy there, how that drives engagement and strengthens the ecosystem and also what it needs for ad dollars for you.\nBrian Olsavsky: First on Prime Day, the -- we're not quantifying the size of it. I think there's some pretty good estimates out there that you probably can leverage. But other than to say it's contemplated in this guidance. On the timing, last year, we had intended to hold Prime Day earlier. We -- there are a number of factors, the Olympics, which are still out there this year. In fact, in some -- many areas, July is a big vacation month. So it might be better to have -- for customers, sellers and vendors to experiment with a different time period. We experimented the other way, obviously, in 2020 by moving it into October, but we believe that it might be a better timing later in Q2. So that's what we're testing this year. On Thursday Night Football, I would say just -- I'm not sure I could size the advertising opportunity right now. But we're very excited to have the exclusive content for Thursday Night Football. Of course, we've broadcast Thursday Night Football for a number of years now, shared that responsibility with a lot of other partners. We think we can do some really new and innovative things with that -- with those games, with the NFL, and we're looking forward to kicking that off in earnest.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Two questions. First on the AWS acceleration, was that at all related to transaction volumes coming back for maybe more cyclical sectors? And could 2Q see even more of that? And then secondly, I think in your release, you talked about 175 million Prime members watching video. It's about 7 of 8 users. So just wondering what you see is the effect on your retail business from that? Any updates you could provide on content spending. And how you think about Prime Video as a driver for overall Amazon.\nBrian Olsavsky: So let me start on the AWS acceleration. We wouldn't point to any particular customer group. We're seeing great usage and expansion across a number of industries and a number of types of customers from startups all the way to enterprises. To put it little bit in perspective for you, in Q1 of 2019, we were at $31 billion run rate. By last year, we had increased that to $41 billion revenue run rate, which is a 32% increase. This year, we're up to a $54 billion annualized run rate, which is, while also a 32% year-over-year growth, it added $13 billion of revenue in the last 12 months as opposed to $10 billion prior -- $10 billion in the prior 12 months before that. So the percentages can be a little deceiving. I would encourage you to look at the absolute dollar growth, although both were very strong in this quarter. So we are seeing, again, strength across the board. We have firm confidence that we offer a lot of advantages to AWS customers from functionality to a vibrant and robust partner ecosystem. And then really, we also have less downtime and better security, which I think is super important to all of our customers, especially security nowadays. So that's on AWS. On -- Dave, why don't you pick up the...\nDave Fildes: Yes. Just in terms of strategy, I think there's probably nothing new or surprising, but just to reiterate it, we look at Prime Video as a component of the broader Prime membership and making sure it's driving adoption and retention as it is. It's a significant acquisition channel in Prime countries. And that we look at it and see that members who watch video have higher free trial conversion rates, higher renewal rates, higher overall engagement. And there's great examples of places like Brazil, where you launch a video-only subscription, for example, that preceded the broader Prime membership with shipping components, and that was, as an example, a great way to expose people to Amazon. And as we launched the broader Prime in Brazil, it was a great mechanism to folks into that program. So a lot of, kind of different experiences there. But as the -- as Jeff's quote would indicate, a lot more people are continuing to enjoy it. And I think the studios team has done a great job, really striving to be the best home for talent, getting a lot of diverse artists and filmmakers and, I think folks are noticing that both critically, but of course, just in terms of viewership, a lot of good momentum there. Just in terms of spend, just to say we continue to expect to grow that on an absolute basis and invest in that beyond original content. Brian talked about live sports and a lot of the great opportunities that feed into that, too. So a lot of continued excitement there.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. Brian, I wanted to ask you one high level one. You guys have done such a great job building out your network and sort of providing consumers with access to so many categories of goods. Give us a couple of examples of areas where you see room for improvement? What areas are you most focused on when you look across all the categories, delivery experience, the countries to invest in and innovate, to really improve the consumer offering? That's one. And then secondly, can you just talk to us about sort of what you've learned about the Echo journey, areas where you've had success, and still existing opportunities for Echo to have a larger installed base and just more of an impact on the ecosystem.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks, Brian, for your questions. There's always a lot of areas that we're working to improve upon. I think generally, the speed of innovation is very quick at Amazon, but we always want it to be quicker. And we always want it to be globally consistent, and we want to take the best practices from 1 country to make sure we're doing it the same way everywhere. I think currently on our list right now is that we are in the process of getting our 1-day shipment percentages back up to where they were pre-pandemic. We're there in Europe, and we're starting to see in Europe not only strong 1-day, but also more broad, same-day selection, so they tend to go hand-in-hand. In the U.S., we've made improvements or consistently getting better. I would say the end delivery is really a function of everything before it, and how well we can handle and process in a timely manner all the orders in North America. It's been challenged by the volumes, but it's also been challenged by the rapid expansion of space. But we're making progress nonetheless, and we hope to get that even higher in 2021. We're very excited about the adoption of our Prime benefits pretty much across the board, especially with the digital benefits. We are looking forward to some new content, even though we're very happy with the performance, the studios business and the content and awards that they were nominated for and were able to garner this year. We have some big things on the horizon, including Lord of the Rings, and we're very excited about getting that type of content to our Prime members quicker.\nDave Fildes: Yes, Brian. And then just on your question on kind of Echo and if I could take it up a level, really broadly, Alexa and devices. Our goal with that has just been -- continues to be to make customers' lives easier and really more convenient. And we want to continue to bring more hardware choices in that case, but also make Alexa smarter with new features. As we talked about before, advances in AI and machine learning, and really deliver tools that help developers and the makers of those devices build for and with Alexa, because in that community, it's not just our Echo devices, but also a variety of third-party device manufacturers. We've seen a lot of momentum with smart home capabilities and working with them. And so -- and I think with us, with so many other areas, it's about making sure we're maintaining a really high bar, and a lot of that with that type of technology is speech recognition capabilities, the intelligence behind it and getting smarter. And some of that becomes a responsibility that customers have higher and higher expectations for their capabilities, something like Alexa, and that's great. And I think if we just look back over the last 12 months and what's been going on, the role that customer usage has played with Alexa and the behavior there, you've seen, as people have been isolated or unable to be as mobile, you see customers are using Alexa to help them stay connected with loved ones. We're seeing customers using Alexa to help stay healthy. So whether that's interacting with health-related tips or fitness apps or increased usage of the Fire TV, and they're looking to Alexa for information. And so using our devices and the services and the Alexa-enabled services for things like educational apps. And then, of course, part of that, too, is making sure they stay entertained when they're trapped or cooped up and don't have other access. So I think you can just see in that example a lot of really good utility, and it just, I think, encourages our teams to strive even harder to serve customers, given when you see those types of examples and how they resonate with customers.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}], "2023": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-02-02 21:26:02", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Quarter 4 2022 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions]. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021.  Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2023 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.  During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions; and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.  Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining today's call. As Dave mentioned earlier, I'm joined today by Andy Jassy, our CEO. Before we move on to take your questions, I will make some comments about our Q4 results. Let's start with revenue.  For the fourth quarter, worldwide net sales were $149.2 billion, representing an increase of 12% year-over-year, excluding approximately 360 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and above the top end of our Q4 guidance range. We've seen that during periods of economic uncertainty, consumers are very careful about how they allocate their resources and where they choose to spend their money.  Throughout Amazon's history, we have found that our focus on the customer helps to set us apart in times like these. This past holiday season, customers came to Amazon for great deals, fast delivery and our widest-ever selection, bolstered by nearly 2 million third-party seller partners who sell on Amazon. Enterprise customers continued their multi-decade shift to the cloud while working closely with our AWS teams to thoughtfully identify opportunities to reduce costs and optimize their work.  In our worldwide stores business, with the ongoing economic uncertainty, coupled with the continuation of inflationary pressures, customers remain cautious about their spending behavior. We saw them spend less on discretionary categories and shift to lower-priced items and value brands in categories like electronics. We also saw them continue to spend on everyday essentials, such as consumables, beauty and softlines. Our teams worked hard to offer low prices and secure millions of deals for customers in Q4, including our first-ever Prime Early Access Sale in October and the more traditional Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday holiday weekend. These global sales events outperformed our expectations as customers responded to millions of deals across our growing selection. Third-party sellers remain a key contributor to that expanding selection.  In Q4, sellers comprised a record 59% of overall unit sales. Sellers, vendors and brands continue to look to Amazon's advertising capabilities to reach customers in the always competitive holiday season, even as the macro environment required them to scrutinize their own marketing budgets.  We saw good growth in advertising revenues in Q4, up 23% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Prime membership continues to be a great value for our customers, and improving our Prime benefits is a continuous part of our investment strategy. Along with competitive pricing, broad selection and faster delivery speed, we've seen Prime members respond to our expanding entertainment offerings.  During the quarter, we completed our first season of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the most watched Amazon original series in every region of the world, reaching over 100 million viewers and driving more Prime sign-ups worldwide during its launch window than any previous Prime Video content. We also finished our inaugural season as the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football, reaching the youngest median age audience of any NFL broadcast package since 2013 and increasing viewership by 11% from last year among hard-to-reach 18- to 34-year-olds.  In aggregate, we invested approximately $7 billion in 2022 across Amazon Originals, live sports and licensed third-party video content included with Prime. That's up from about $5 billion in 2021. As a reminder, these digital video content costs are included in cost of sales on our income statement. We regularly evaluate the return on the spend and continue to be encouraged by what we see, as video has proven to be a strong driver of Prime member engagement and new Prime member acquisition.  Moving on to AWS. Net sales increased $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year-over-year and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions. As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter.  Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term.  As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens. That said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.  Now let's shift to worldwide operating income. For the quarter, we reported $2.7 billion in operating income. The operating income was negatively impacted by 3 large items, which added approximately $2.7 billion of costs in the quarter. This was related to employee severance, impairments of property and equipment and operating leases and changes in estimates related to self-insurance liabilities. This cost primarily impacted our North America segment. If we had not incurred these charges in Q4, our operating income would have been approximately $5.4 billion. We are encouraged with the progress we continue to make in streamlining the costs in our Amazon stores business. We entered the quarter with labor more appropriately matched to demand across our operations network compared to Q4 of last year, allowing us to have the right labor in the right place at the right time and drive productivity gains.  We also saw continued efficiencies across our transportation network, where process and tech improvements resulted in higher Amazon Logistics productivity and improved line haul fill rates. While transportation overperformed expectations in the quarter, we also saw productivity improvements across our fulfillment centers, in line with our plan.  We also saw good leverage driven by strong holiday volumes. Overall, it was a strong effort by the operations team, and we look forward to making further headway as we head into 2023. We remain focused on driving cost efficiencies throughout the network and reducing our cost to serve our customers, while ensuring we maintain an outstanding customer experience.  Circling back to the 3 large charges during the quarter. Let me share some additional color, starting with the job eliminations we initiated during the fourth quarter. As we consider the ongoing uncertainties of the macroeconomic environment, this led us to the difficult decision to eliminate just over 18,000 roles, primarily impacting our stores and device businesses as well as our human resources teams. As a result, we recorded estimated severance cost of $640 million. These charges were recorded primarily in technology and content, fulfillment and general administration on our income statement.  Next, we recorded impairments of property and equipment and operating leases, primarily related to our Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go physical stores. We're continuously refining our store formats to find the ones that will resonate with customers, will build our grocery brand and will allow us to scale meaningfully over time. As such, we periodically access our portfolio of stores and decided to exit certain stores with low growth potential. We'll also take an impairment on capitalized costs and associated values of our leased buildings. The impairment charge in Q4 was $720 million and is included in other operating expense on our income statement.  We continue to believe grocery is a significant opportunity, and we're focused on serving customers through multiple channels, whether that's online delivery, pickup or in-store shopping. Lastly, during the quarter, we increased our reserves for general product and automobile self-insurance liabilities, driven by changes in our estimates about the cost of asserted and unasserted claims, resulting in additional expense of $1.3 billion. This impact is primarily recorded in cost of sales on our income statement.  As our business has grown quickly over the last several years, particularly as we've built out our fulfillment and transportation network and claim amounts have seen industry-wide inflation, we've continued to evaluate and adjust this reserve for both asserted claims as well as our estimate for unasserted claims.  We reported overall net income of $278 million in the fourth quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation loss of $2.3 billion included in nonoperating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations but rather the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price.  As we head into the new year, we remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.\nAndrew Jassy: Everybody, this is Andy. Just before we start with the questions, I just wanted to say it's good to be with you all on the call today. I thought I might jump on the calls from time to time moving forward. And given that this last quarter was the end of my first full year in this role, and given some of the unusual parts in the economy and our business, I thought this might be a good one to join. So thanks for having me.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. Andy, I want to ask you, just the first one, you've been in the seat for a while. As you sit there, what are your key focal points, product categories or investment priorities that you're most focused on to drive durable multiyear growth in that North America retail segment as we recover?  And then the second one, just sort of staying on the North America retail side, how do you think about the potential margin potential of that business over the next few years as you sort of grow into the warehouse? And what are the warehouse network? And what are the efficiency factors to get you to those goals?\nBrian Olsavsky: Brian, this is Brian. First, let me just start with your second question. On the -- sorry, can you hear me? On the expectation for retail margins, especially in North America, what we've said is when we look back to our cost structure pre-pandemic, we were just in the end of 2019, early part of 2020. We're just starting to roll out one-day shipping in North America, and we had an expectation of what our cost structure would look like. That has changed quite a bit in the last 3 years now due to a doubling of our network expansion. I think you've heard me tell this story on different calls.  But essentially, we're now trying to, again, regain our cost structure that we've had in the past, balance the -- and get more efficient on the assets we've added in the last 2, 3 years now and also look at all the investment areas that we are working on to drive growth, continuing to look at them where we need to make course corrections, where we need to change things up. And we expect that, again, a lot of the improvement will be in North America operations costs. We made good headway in 2022. We always want to make more, and we're going to be working on this definitely through 2023 and beyond. But we hope to make and expect to make big improvements in 2023.\nAndrew Jassy: Yes. And I'll start just at a broad level, priority-wise, the connective tissue for everything we do across the company, including in stores in North America, is we realize that we exist to make customers' lives better and easier every day and relentlessly went to do so. And being maniacally focused on the customer experiences, always going to be a top priority for us. At the same time, and this is true in North America as well as across the entire business, we're working really hard to streamline our costs and trying to do so at the same time that we don't give up on the long-term strategic investments that we believe can meaningfully change broad customer experiences and change Amazon over the long term.  As I addressed directly the North American stores questions, I think our -- probably the #1 priority that I spent time with the team on is reducing our cost to serve in our operations network. And as Brian touched on, it's important to remember that over the last few years, we've -- we took a fulfillment center footprint that we've built over 25 years and doubled it in just a couple of years. And then we, at the same time, built out a transportation network for last mile roughly the size of UPS in a couple of years. And so when you do both of those things to meet the huge surge in demand, you're going to -- just to get those functional, it took everything we had. And so there's a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient and more productive.  And then I think at the same time, if you think about doubling the number of fulfillment centers you have and then adding a very large transportation network and you realize that all of those facilities have to link together to get products to customers, that's a pretty big expansion in the number of nodes in the network. It becomes a little bit different network. And so to figure out how to be really efficient across all those links and have them be highly utilized and to get the flows in those facilities working the right way, it takes time. So we're working very hard on it. I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q4, and you can see that in some of the results. But that work will extend into '23. So that's first.  I think the second thing, priority-wise, I would talk about is just speed. We believe that continuing to get products to customers faster, makes customers happier, and they also converted a higher rate when they can see promises of deliveries that are faster. I think selection will always be a very high area of focus for us. We work with hundreds of thousands in the U.S. and millions overall in the world of selling partners. In this past quarter, 59% of the units sold were from our third-party selling partners, and we work very hard to provide unmatched selection. And that matters a lot to customers.  I think pricing being sharp is always important. But particularly in this type of uncertain economy, where customers are very conscious about how much they're spending, having the millions of deals that we put together with our selling partners in the fourth quarter was an important part of the demand that you saw, and we'll continue to work really hard on being sharp on pricing.  And then just the customer experience improvements that we're working all the time, whether it's adding Buy with Prime that allows Prime users to use their Prime benefits on other websites than just Amazon; or adding RxPass in the health care space, where our Prime customers for $5 a month can get all the medicines they're using in unlimited fashion; or whether it's just even in our apparel business, where when you're looking clothing you might buy, being able to see virtually your shoes with that outfit to see how it looks and it changes your customer experience, your buying experience, we will continue to work very hard on those customer experiences, and we have a lot more planned.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: Also for Andy, I have two. Just first, how would you evaluate your efforts in grocery thus far? I know you're -- it's a big, huge market. You're attacking it different ways. What are the key steps here that you're focused on to drive greater market share?  And then secondly, how should we think about the strategic importance of some of these emerging bets type of areas like health care and Kuiper and autonomous vehicles, among others?\nAndrew Jassy: On the first one on grocery, I'd just start by saying that we think grocery is a really important and strategic area for us. It's a very large market segment, and there's a lot of frequency in how consumers shop for grocery. And we also believe that over time, grocery is going to be omnichannel. There are going to be a lot of people that order their grocery items online and have it delivered to them, and there are going to be a lot of people who continue to buy in physical stores. But you're going to also see a hybrid of those, where people pick out what they want online and pick it up in stores, or people are in stores and there's something that's not in inventory in the stores, so they go to their app or to a kiosk and order it to be delivered from online. And so I think having omnichannel is going to really matter.  And I think that we have a pretty significant-sized grocery business. I think people sometimes don't realize that and that we've been building for a long time. It's continuing to accelerate, and I kind of see it broken into a few pieces. If you think about the online grocery offering, we have a very large business there. It looks different from the typical mega physical grocery store. But if you think about the aisles in a grocery store, from packaged food to paper products to canned goods to pet supplies to health and personal care items to consumables, we have a very large business there that continues to grow at a rapid clip and then we think will continue to grow.  But it doesn't have a big market segment share in perishables. And if you really want to have significant market segment share in perishables, you typically need physical stores. And we have kind of 2 different offerings there. For what I think is the very best organic physical store experience and selection, we have Whole Foods, which is a very significant-sized business that's continuing to grow. I really like the progress that, that business has made on profitability in the last year. And I like what I see in front of it, and I think that's a very -- it's a premium product, but it's a significant business. It's a good business for us in the grocery space.  I think if you want to have a mass physical store offering, you need a different offering. And that's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh, and we have a few dozen stores so far. We're doing a fair bit of experimentation today in those stores to try to find a format that we think resonates with customers. It's differentiated in some meaningful fashion and where we like the economics. And we've been -- we've decided over the last year or so that we're not going to expand the physical Fresh doors until we have that equation with differentiation and economic value that we like, but we're optimistic that we're going to find that in 2023. We're working hard at it. We see some encouraging signs. And when we do find that equation, we will expand it more expansively. But I think that we have a very significant opportunity in the grocery segment. I think we're building a pretty broad grocery network across online and physical, and you're going to see us continue to work on it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Maybe I'll ask one big picture of Andy and then just a housekeeping matter to Brian, if I can. Andy, keeping on this theme of sort of big picture and strategy and your perspective, I'd love to get your view on the international e-commerce businesses. Obviously, you're in a range of geographies with a wide variance of maturity and different investment cycles. Can you give us your perspective on how you see Amazon's global e-commerce footprint today? And how investors should be thinking about the mix of growth and margin evolution in those international businesses in the years ahead?  And maybe, Brian, if I can just ask a quick follow-up. In the Q1 operating income guidance that you gave, I think there's some confusion among investors as to where you might be capturing some of the restructuring charges from the announcements that the company has made on employee count between Q4 and Q1. Can you just clarify what was captured in Q4 versus what might be included in the way you frame the Q1 operating income guidance?\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, let me start. This is Brian. Let me start with that second part. So as I said earlier, we took a $640 million charge tied to the position elimination that we announced in Q4. A lot of that fell into Q1 into mid to late January. So the way to think about it is for the terminations in January, the salaries for the first 3 weeks are covered in operating results for Q1. But the period after that, where there's weeks or months of severance coverage, job placement, a lot of those costs are what the $640 million charge was in Q4. So I hope that helps.\nAndrew Jassy: And on the question about international e-commerce, we're very enthusiastic about the business we're building there. I think just perspective, if you look at the compounded annual growth rate from 2019 to '21, in the U.K., it was over 30%; in Germany, it was 26%; in Japan, it was 21%. And the fact that we haven't given back that growth, and these are all net of FX, but if you look at even the last couple of quarters where we're continuing to grow and we haven't given back some of that growth, a meaningful amount of market segment share has shifted to our global established e-commerce territories, and we're excited about that.  Now we're -- at this stage, we're big enough in our developed international territories that when there's something significant happening in the macro, we're going to be impacted as well. And if you just look in Europe as an example, the inflation is higher than most places, and the impact on Europeans for the war in Ukraine is more significant, and also the energy prices and hikes there are more significant. So you can see that in some of our growth numbers.  And then you look at our emerging countries, and these are -- they're all a little bit different in all -- in a little bit different stage as you recognize in the question. But if you look at countries like India and Brazil and the Middle East and Africa and Turkey, Mexico and Australia and a number of those types of countries, we like what we're seeing. They take a certain amount of time. There's a certain amount of fixed investment you have to make when you enter a new geography, and then you have to drive a certain amount of revenue to be able to cover that fixed investment. But they're all on the right trajectory and following trajectories that roughly look like what we saw in North America and our established international geographies, and we think it's the right investment and believe we're going to have a large profitable international e-commerce business.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great. Maybe one for Andy and then one for Brian. AWS, if you look at the revenue growth of mid-teens, it implies it could be flattish and even down this quarter. So maybe talk about what's driving that. Is it workload changes? Are there some clients that are shifting? Anything on the market share you could comment on?  And then second, when do you think this could recover? Like what's the time frame? And would you expect margins to come back when revenues reaccelerate? I'll leave it at that.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Justin, for your question. This is Brian. Let me start with the -- what we're seeing at the customer level. So as I've mentioned, continuing -- it's across all industries. There are some points of weakness, things like financial services, like mortgage companies that do. As mortgage volumes down, some of their compute challenges or compute volumes are down. Crypto is -- lower trading in crypto. And things tied to advertising, as there's lower advertising spend, there's less analytics and compute on advertising spend as well.  But -- so there's . But by and large, what we're seeing is just an interest and a priority by our customers to get their spend down as they enter an economic downturn. We're doing the same thing at Amazon, questioning our infrastructure expenses as well as everything else. And we -- there's things you can do. You can defer -- you can switch to lower-cost products. You can run calculations less frequently. There's just -- you can do different types of storage on your data. So there's ways to alter your cost and your bill in a short period of time. I think that's what we're seeing. And as I said, we're working with our customers to help them do that. And again, we're seeing ourselves at Amazon. So I'll let Andy add some color on kind of the general trends in AWS, but that's more what we're seeing at the customer level right now.\nAndrew Jassy: So I would just add -- I mean, I think Brian covered a bunch of it. I think most enterprises right now are acting cautiously. You see it with virtually every enterprise, and we're being very thoughtful about streamlining our costs as well. And when you are being cautious, you look for ways that you can find -- you can spend less money. And where companies can cost optimize or, in some cases, they may be used to doing analysis over 90 days of information and they say, \"Well, can I get away with it for 2 weeks, doing 2 weeks' worth,\" it's not necessarily the best thing long term. But a lot of companies will do that when they're in uncertain economic situation.  And the reality is that the way that we've built all our businesses, but AWS in this particular instance, is that we're going to help our customers find a way to spend less money. We are not focused on trying to optimize in any one quarter or any one year, we're trying to build a set of relationships in business that outlast all of us. And so if it's good for our customers to find a way to be more cost effective in an uncertain economy, our team is going to spend a lot of cycles doing that.  And it's one of the advantages that we've talked about since we launched AWS in 2006 of the cloud, which is that when it turns out you have a lot more demand than you anticipated, you can seamlessly scale up. But if it turns out that you don't need as much demand as you had, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it. And that elasticity is very unusual. It's something you can't do on-premises, which is one of the many reasons why the cloud is and AWS are very effective for customers.  I think -- and I've spent a fair bit of time with the AWS team on this, and we look closely at what we see. We have a very robust, healthy customer pipeline, new customers, migrations that are set to happen. A lot of companies during times of discontinuity like this will step back and think about what they want to change strategically to be in a position to reinvent their businesses and change their customer experiences more quickly as uncertain economies emerge, and that often means moving to the cloud. We see a number of those pieces as well.  And we're the only ones that really break out our cloud numbers in a more specific way. So it's always a little bit hard to answer your question about what we see. But we, to our best estimations, when we look at the absolute dollar growth year-over-year, we still have significantly more absolute dollar growth than anybody else we see in this space. And I think some of that's a function of the fact that we just have a lot more capability by a large amount, with stronger security and operational performance and a larger partner ecosystem.  So I think it's also useful to remember that 90% to 95% of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And if you believe that, that equation is going to shift and flip, I don't think on-premises will ever go away, but I really do believe in the next 10 to 15 years that most of it will be in the cloud if we continue to have the best customer experience, which we have to work really hard at an event which we're working to do. It means we have a lot of growth in front of us in the AWS business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi.\nRonald Josey: Maybe a bigger high-level question here just around Prime member engagement and just seeing third-party seller services growth accelerating in the quarter. And I believe it was mentioned that customer is spending more on everyday essentials, which may be a relatively new use case. Talk just a little bit more, maybe Andy and Brian, just around how engagement is evolving here for Prime members and really how this has grown wallet share over time and where this is going.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Thanks, Ron, for your question. I would say that the Prime membership is -- remains strong and so has the dollars purchased per Prime member. It varies a bit by geography. But in general, if you step back, we had some very large video properties that we had launched last year, Thursday Night Football and Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power. Both of them had record sign-ups for Prime membership. And we know that, again, investments like that will help with not only a new member or new Prime member acquisition, but also retention. And we see a direct link between that type of engagement and higher purchases of everyday products on our Amazon website.  So the health of Prime is very strong. As Andy mentioned earlier, we are continuing to work to get our speed of delivery up to get more one-day shipments. And we think that will also be well received by Prime members. But it's a combination of price selection and convenience. I think we've made inroads on all of them, especially with the third-party selection that's been added over the last few years. So I think testament to that is the sales that we had in the fourth quarter. In a very competitive and deal-driven environment, people came, Prime members and others came to Amazon to do their shopping. So we're encouraged by it.\nAndrew Jassy: Just to add really one piece here, which is just, if you step back and think about a lot of subscription programs, there are a number of them that are $14, $15 a month really for entertainment content, which is more than what Prime is today. If you think about the value of Prime, which is less than what I just mentioned, where you get the entertainment content on the Prime Video side and you get the shipping benefit, the fast shipping benefit you can't find elsewhere and you get the music benefit, you get the Prime Gaming benefit and you get the photos benefit and you get the Buy with Prime capability, use your Prime subscription on websites beyond just Amazon and some of the grocery benefits that we provide, and RxPass like we just launched to get a number of medications people take regularly for $5 a month unlimited, that is remarkable value that you just don't find elsewhere. And we will continue to add things to Prime and continue to experiment with lots of different features and benefits. But it's still early days. And as we continue to make the service better and better and fully featured, we see people continuing to spend more at Amazon across our various businesses. So we're optimistic about it.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Two questions. Brian, just any color on why mid-teens is kind of a holdable growth rate for AWS over the next couple of quarters, given what looks like pretty clearly, continuing deterioration in enterprise demand?  And then, Andy, I wonder at a high level if you could just talk about how your priorities may have changed or the company's priorities may have changed over the last year or so as you've been the CEO. And it looks like there's a bit of a peel back on devices, a peel back on physical stores, except for groceries and then maybe a little bit more of a lean in on health. And I'm not quite sure what you're doing with entertainment content spend like that. Maybe it's the same, maybe it's a little bit more. But just at a high level, how would you say your priorities have changed or are different than the prior CEOs?\nBrian Olsavsky: So on the AWS growth rate, I'm not sure I can forecast for you with any level of certainty what is going to happen beyond this quarter. You kind of -- this is a bit uncharted territories economically. And as we mentioned, there's some unique things going on with the customer base that I think many in this industry are all seeing the same thing.  So I don't have a crystal ball on that one, but we are going to continue to work for to be there for our customers. And as I said in the earlier comments, we do have new deals. We have new workloads coming to the cloud. The value was there. And whether there's short term, perhaps short-term belt tightening in the infrastructure expense by a lot of companies, I think the long-term trends are still there. And I think the quickest way to save money is to get to the cloud, quite frankly.  So there's a lot of long-term positive in tough economic times. Saw that in 2020 when volumes for customers shifted very quickly. It led to a resurgence after that and probably acceleration of people's journeys to the cloud, and we'll just have to see if that happens again with what we're seeing today.\nAndrew Jassy: Yes. I would say I think for any leadership team, each era is different, and it's often meaningfully impacted by what's happening around you. And I think that if you look at the last couple of years with things like the pandemic and the labor shortage in 2021 and the war in Ukraine and inflation and uncertain economy, good leadership teams look around and try to figure out what that means and how they should adjust their businesses.  And so if you look at -- in the early part of 2022, I think we realized that as we tried to make sure we met the surge in demand for consumers and sellers and having to make decisions in 2020 for what fulfillment network investments we're going to make in 2022, we just had more capacity than we needed. And you saw us in the early part of 2022 delay some of our builds and mothballed some of our facilities to try and be more economic.  And I think when we look at some of our physical business investments, physical store investments, I think there were just some areas where we didn't have conviction that they were going to be big needle movers for Amazon. And so that's why we closed down our 4-Star bookstores. And as we got into the early part of the summer, where we start our operating planning process, we -- and there was a lot of things happening in the macro economy, we started that process with the high-level tenet of we want to find a way to meaningfully streamline our costs in all of our businesses, not just their existing large businesses, but also in some of the investments we're making. We want to actually do a pretty good, thorough look about what we're investing and how much we think we need to, but doing so without having to give up our ability to invest in the key long-term strategic investments that we think could change broad customer experiences and change Amazon over time.  And you saw that process led to us choosing to pause on incremental headcount as we tried to assess what was happening in the economy, and we eliminated some programs in fabric.com and Amazon Care and Amazon Glo and Amazon Explore. We decided to go slower on some -- on the physical store expansion in the grocery space until we had a format that we really believed in rolling out and we went a little bit slower on some devices, and until we made the very hard decision that Brian talked about earlier, which was the hardest decision I think we've all been a part of, which was to reduce or eliminate 18,000 roles. And so those were all done with an eye towards trying to streamline our cost but still be able to invest in the things that we think really matter over the long term.  Now we have a way of looking at investments that is different maybe from some other companies. I'm not saying it's right or wrong. It's just the way we look at it, which is when we think about big areas to invest in, we ask ourselves a few questions. We ask, if we were successful, could it really be big and move the needle at Amazon, which is a high bar at a place like Amazon? Do we think it's being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have some competence in those areas? And if we don't, can we acquire them quickly? And if we like the answers to those questions, we will invest.  Sometimes, that leads to very logical extensions for people. When I got to Amazon 25 years ago, we were a books-only retailer. And when we expanded into music and video and electronics, that seemed pretty natural to people. Amazingly, people were very surprised we were expanding into tools. That seemed far field for people, but it turned out not to be.  When we launch something like Buy with Prime, I think people see that as more predictable. That process has also led us to less predictable investments. And I remember, I had a front-row seat in the AWS experience, having worked with the team and led the team from the very start. And I remember both externally and internally, there were a number of people who wondered why we were doing that. It was so different from retail only. But think about how different a company Amazon would be today if we hadn't invested in AWS.  And so that informs some of the other meaningful investments we're making beyond our stores, in retail and advertising and AWS businesses. I think that while we've gone slower in some devices and things, we still -- when we look at the answers to those 4 questions, we are very enthusiastic about our investments in streaming entertainment devices, our low Earth orbit satellite and Kuiper, health care and a few other things. And I think that do I think every one of our new investments will be successful? History would say that, that would be a long shot. However, it only takes one or two of them becoming the fourth pillar for Amazon for us to be a very different company over time.  So I think it's very worthwhile. We're going to continue to invest. We're going to be very thoughtful about how we streamline our costs, and I think you see a lot of that, but we're also going to continue to invest for the long term.\nDave Fildes: Thank you for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-10-27 19:55:04", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2022 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.  For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2022 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions; and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to-date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining today's call. Before we move to questions, I will make some comments about our Q3 performance and the outlook for Q4. For the third quarter, worldwide net sales were $127.1 billion, representing an increase of 19% year-over-year, excluding approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. As the dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter, the foreign exchange impact was higher than the 390 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q3 guidance. This represents a headwind of approximately $900 million, more than we initially guided to. Throughout the quarter, our worldwide stores business continued to stay highly focused on our customers and driving the inputs that matter most, which helped to accelerate sales growth in the quarter. We now offer our widest selection ever. We've taken actions that have driven strong recovery of in-stock rates, and we continue to work on improving delivery speeds, all while ensuring our pricing remains sharp for our customers. Third-party sellers and the products they offer remain an important strength of our offering for consumers, representing 58% of total paid units sold in Q3, the highest percentage ever. It's up from 56% in Q3 of last year. And we're working with these partners, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, to build an even stronger offering. We recently hosted Amazon Accelerate, our US conference for selling partners, where we introduced new tools, including new e-mail marketing capabilities, free-to-use shipping software that offers discounted shipping rates and new features and analytics to help sellers better understand and act on conversion-driving content. This was a big quarter for Prime members. We celebrated our eighth Prime Day in July, which contributed approximately 400 basis points to our Q3 year-over-year sales growth rate. Prime members purchased more than 300 million items worldwide, making it the biggest Prime Day net sales event in Amazon's history. As a reminder, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter of 2021. We also debut the two largest Prime Video releases ever. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power attracted more than 25 million global viewers on its first day. And in the first two months since its launch, Rings of Power has driven more Prime sign-ups globally than any other Amazon Original. NFL Thursday Night Football also premiered in September, averaging more than 15 million viewers during its first broadcast, and driving the three biggest hours of US Prime sign-ups in the history of Amazon. Our next broadcast, the seventh of the 15-game schedule, kicks off in a few hours, with the Ravens visiting the Buccaneers. We also saw good growth in our advertising offerings where sales grew 30% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange as vendors and sellers have embraced our portfolio of products, which allow advertisers to build general awareness and/or drive sales of a specific product. In AWS, net sales increased to $20.5 billion in Q3, up 28% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and now representing an annualized sales run rate of $82 billion. With the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling costs. And we're proactively working to help customers cost optimize, just as we've done throughout AWS' history, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. The breadth and depth of our service offerings enable us to help them do things like move storage to lower-priced tiers options and shift workloads to our Graviton chips. Graviton3 processors delivered 40% better price performance than comparable x86-based instances. And our teams across AWS continue to work relentlessly to expand that breadth and depth, including recent launches of new EC2 machine learning training instances in AWS IoT fleet-wise. And we continue to expand the AWS infrastructure footprint to support customers with the launch of the AWS Middle East region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific region in Thailand. Now, let's shift to operating income. During the quarter, we reported $2.5 billion in operating income. Turning first to our North America and international segments, during the quarter, we generated over $1 billion in operations cost improvements driven by higher leverage of our fixed cost base and continued productivity improvements in our fulfillment and transportation networks. This represents a solid improvement in productivity quarter-over-quarter, though not quite as much as we had planned. We are encouraged by the progress made during the quarter, but we recognize there's still a lot of opportunity to continue to improve productivity and drive cost efficiencies throughout our networks. We have identified initiatives that the teams continue to work hard on, and we expect to see further improvement in the quarters ahead. Another impact to operating income was the step-up in Prime Video content and marketing costs in Q3, primarily driven by the global premiere of the Rings of Power and the launch of the NFL Thursday Night Football package in the United States. Our results were also negatively impacted by non-recurring charges related to the closure of certain businesses and products such as Amazon Care, Fabric.com and Amazon Explore. We continue to ramp up our investments in AWS, adding product builders and sales and professional services headcount to help customers save money, invent more quickly in their businesses and transition to the cloud. We're also continuing to invest in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs, expanding to new geographic regions, developing new services and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. Overall stock-based compensation expense was $5.6 billion in Q3, up from $5.2 billion in the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated forfeiture rate on certain unvested stock awards. We reported overall net income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation gain of $1.1 billion included in non-operating income from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, the impact of this investment to our income statement is driven by quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price. Now let's discuss capital investments, which is the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the full year 2022, we expect to incur approximately $60 billion in capital investments, which is broadly in line with what we spent in 2021. This represents an estimated reduction in fulfillment and transportation capital investments of approximately $10 billion compared to last year, as we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with demand. And this is offset by an approximately $10 billion year-over-year increase in technology infrastructure, primarily to support the rapid growth, innovation and continued expansion of our AWS footprint. We also provided our fourth quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. While we are encouraged by our progress across the business, macroeconomic environment remains challenging worldwide. The continuing impacts of broad-scale inflation, heightened fuel prices and rising energy costs have impacted our sales growth as consumers assess their purchasing power and organizations of all sizes evaluate their technology and advertising spend. As the third quarter progressed, we saw moderating sales growth across many of our businesses as well as the increased foreign currency headwinds, I mentioned earlier, and we expect these impacts to persist throughout the fourth quarter. As we've done at similar times in our history, we're also taking actions to tighten our belt, including pausing hiring in certain businesses and winding down products and services where we believe our resources are better spent elsewhere. We aim to strike the right balance between investing for our customers for the long-term, while driving operational efficiency improvements and accomplishing more with less. When faced with an uncertain economy or some kind of discontinuous event, customers tend to double-down on companies that they believe have the best customer experience and that take care of them the best. And that is where our efforts remain focused. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are ready to make this a great holiday season for our customers. We kicked off the season a few weeks ago with our first-ever Prime Early Access sales event where tens of millions of Prime members shopped and ordered more than 100 million items from Amazon's selling partners. We remain heads-down focused on driving a fantastic customer experience, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, let's move on to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Brian, maybe I'll just ask a two-parter with respect to the revenue guide for Q4. Can you help us better understand some of the comments you made around the exit velocity, specifically with respect to the US e-commerce business or the AWS business and how that might inform, some of the lower-than-seasonal trends that seem to be implied in the Q4 guide, specifically with respect to either optimizations on the AWS side or changes in consumption behavior on the US e-commerce side? Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure thing, Eric. Thanks for your question. As I look ahead to guidance for Q4, I think the biggest individual factor is still going to be foreign exchange. This guidance includes 460 basis points of unfavorable impact year-over-year. FX is a bigger issue for us on our revenue growth in dollars than it is on our income. It actually has a slight favorability due to the investments we're making internationally. But put that aside for a moment. What we saw in Q3 was a really strong July with a great reaction to Prime Day globally. And the resumption of things like in-stock rates are starting to come back, and delivery speed was coming back. And that continued through the quarter, but growth rates started to slow a bit. And primarily in the consumer stores business, it was in international. North America, obviously, it was strong, but it started to slow a bit. But it was mostly in international where we saw the biggest impact, and we think that is tied to a tougher recessionary environment there. Compared to the US, it's worse in Europe right now. The Ukraine war and the energy crisis issues have really compounded in that geography. But when I talk about enterprise customers in AWS, yes, we've been working with customers to lower their bills. Just like all companies, they want to lower their spend when they're faced with uncertainty in the market. I would say one that's real valuable points about cloud computing is that it's turning fixed cost into variable for many of our customers, and we help them save money either through alternative services or Graviton3 chips. There's many ways that we have to help them lower their spending and still get great cost performance ratios. So what we're really excited about the business, both in the long term and even in the short run, you noticed we've added $4.5 billion to the $16 billion base we had of revenue last Q3, so the business is growing in absolute dollars at a really good clip. We do see some of the consumers are cutting their budgets and trying to save money in the short run. I would say that although we had a 28% growth rate for the quarter for AWS, the back end of the quarter, we were more in the mid-20% growth rate. So we've carried that forecast through to the fourth quarter. We're not sure how it's going to play out, but that's generally our assumption. We're excited about the re:Invent conference that's coming up in late November. We expect to have over 40,000 people in Las Vegas and many more tuning in virtually. So continue to drive value for customers with new products, new services and, lately also, additional ways for them to manage their budgets and optimize in what is shaping up as a tough economy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Anmuth: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, free cash flow generation has always been Amazon's focus in the past, but that went negative last year and likely this year as well. Can you just talk about the path to restoring meaningful free cash flow? And do you think that CapEx tied to data centers and the AWS ramp can ultimately step back, similar to what we've seen recently with fulfillment and transport? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yeah. I think if you look at our free cash flow, there's multiple factors here. One is the drop-off in income for the trailing 12 months versus the 12 months before it, and a lot of that is driven to things that we've talked about on these calls. Ops cost, we\u2019re still not in a -- our network doubled over the last 2.5 years. While we're making strides in productivity and network optimization, we still work to do there. So we have to get our cost structure back to pre-pandemic levels in a lot of areas of the company and mostly in operations. There's a unique thing going on with inventory right now because we have a lot of weeks of cover mainly due to supply chain issues coming out of Asia primarily and we're seeing with our sellers, too. We just have additional weeks of cover. We think our model reacts quickly to customer demand. This is more about the other side of the equation, the supply chain and having more in stock. So what the issue there is that we generally have a favorable working capital impact from accounts payable that is more days than our inventory. That's been flipping the last year, and we expect that to normalize as we move into 2023. And then CapEx is a big driver. We had, again, a doubling of the network, had very high CapEx the last two years. You'll see that we've lowered CapEx year-over-year. We probably cut about one-third of our budget from what we originally thought for 2022 while still focusing our capital dollars really on the AWS business and increasing customer demand or capacity for increasing customer demand in our stores business. So we're working hard on all those dimensions. And we expect, as we see a recovery in income generation, normalization of the inventory versus accounts payable cycle and efficiency in our CapEx spend, we intend to flip those numbers around.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney: Let me ask two profit questions. AWS margins were a little lower than we would have thought. Is that just a reflection of the full quarter impact of that stock-based compensation granted to those employees earlier in the year? Is that the new normal for AWS margins? And then international losses also were a little bit heavier than we thought, just talk about what drove those losses. And is that also the new normal for that segment? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with AWS. So we did see a deceleration or a drop in op margin sequentially quarter-over-quarter. The broad disclaimer on AWS margins is that they will fluctuate over time as we balance investments versus renegotiating pricing with the long-term customer commitments, all as headwinds to the business, offset by increasing productivity and efficiencies in our data centers, which drive profitability. So there's moving parts there. I'd say what's happening lately is, yes, the stock-based comp. We have seen inflation in our wages this year and particularly on our Czech employees is heavily concentrated in AWS. So that's one element of it. We're also seeing energy costs that are materially higher than they had in pre-pandemic, electricity and the impact of natural gas pricing. So those prices have up more than 2x over the last couple of years and contribute to about 200 basis point degradation versus 2 years ago. So we're fighting through some of that as well, which is a new thing for the AWS business. But we'll continue to look for ways to optimize our operations to use less energy. And as we scale, we'll outrun that growth trajectory. On international, international is always a mix of profitability in more established countries of Europe and Japan, offset by emerging countries and investments in Prime benefits. I think the biggest issue quarter-over-quarter, the increase in losses versus Q2 was tied to some additional operating costs in Europe. We've seen higher fuel costs there, even more certainly in the United States. And Prime Day always has lesser profitability because there's just a lot of deals. And it's a bit of margin from Prime Day in both North America and international. So a big part of that is device sales. And again, we sell a lot of devices during our Prime Day events. We don't make money on the device. We make money on the use of the device. So that always can end up hurting profitability in the quarter. So there are some contributing things. As far as new normal, we're working very hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal, and we'll see how quickly we can make improvements. A lot of the improvements that I talked about on a macro level, capital efficiency, operations improvements are as important internationally as they are in North America.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Brian, on AWS, I'm just curious when you talk about optimizing and efficiency, can you talk to what you're seeing from your customers why perhaps you're seeing such a big pullback in terms of near-term demand? How would you characterize those conversations? And I think the other question is related to backlog. Backlog has been running 60-plus percent, so the divergence between revenue and backlog is pretty large. Everyone's asking, how do you describe that divergence?\nBrian Olsavsky: Let me have Dave answer the backlog question first.\nDave Fildes: Yeah. It's Dave here. So I think our current backlog balance for Q3 is $104 billion. So it's about a little less than 60%, I think about 57% up year-over-year. And the new customer pipeline is healthy. I think with a lot of enterprises and customers, they're continuing to put plans in place. I think Brian will talk a little bit about some of the cost optimization in a second. Backlog growth, this figure, it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter because it is dependent on the commitments that you sign in the period and how those adjust but, yes, $104.3 billion for the end of Q3.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. And your first question about cost optimization, first, there are some industries that have lower demand that's showing up in our volumes as probably like other companies as well, things like financial services, the mortgage business being down, cryptocurrencies being down. We're very strong in some of those industries, and that's part of it. But basically, what we see is customers are looking to save money versus their committed spend. We have options for them to do that. They can manage workloads better. They can switch to lower-cost products that have different performance profiles. They can switch to Graviton chips that have higher cost performance ratios. So, all really good things for the customer and for Amazon long-term. Again, we think the benefit of cloud computing is really showing up right now, because we allow customers to turn what can normally be a fixed expense into a variable expense, and they can let us manage the highs and lows of inflation and other cost of electricity and everything else. And they can get about to do their business using our services in a very highly secure way. So, I think just like in 2020, these time periods are good for long-term adoption on cloud computing. But the offset in the short run is that some companies have demand that drops. I think what was different in 2020 was there were companies that went down and there's companies that went up quite a bit that were servicing high volumes during the pandemic. So, that dynamic is not in place right now, and I think everyone is just cautious and they want to, again, watch their spend. And as CFO, I appreciate that, and we're doing the same thing here at Amazon.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Blackledge: That\u2019s great. Thanks. Two questions. First, could you provide some more details on the cost structure initiatives, and when we could see those initiatives hitting the P&L? And then second, on the holiday season. It's a bit implicit in your guide and remarks thus far, but just curious of your expectations for consumer demand this holiday season versus last year. Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the holiday. So, we're ready to roll. We've got the best selection we've ever had. In-stock levels are really high. Delivery speeds are getting very close to where we want them to be. And we're ready to have a really good holiday season with our consumers this year. And the Prime Early Access sale, I think, created great value for consumers. It allowed them to get a jump on some of their purchases for the holiday and also just find some great deals. So, we're happy with that effort. And the teams that put that together worked very hard this year to hold two large Prime events within four months. So, we're very optimistic about the holiday. But we're realistic that there's various factors weighing on people's wallets, and we're not quite sure how strong holiday spending will be versus last year. And we're ready for a variety of outcomes. But we know the consumers when they're looking for good deals, and that positions us well. Advertisers are looking for effective advertising. And our advertising is at the point where consumers are ready to spend. So we have a lot of advantages that we feel that will help both consumers and also our partners like sellers and advertisers. So the seller in-stock is very high. We've had great in-stocks from our FBA sellers. And so we're ready to go. And we're very optimistic about the fourth quarter, just realistic about whether we may have a range of outcomes that we just have to be ready for when we are. On the cost structure initiatives, I think you're primarily talking about the operations world. We made -- there's three large buckets there, as I've said in the past, productivity, fixed cost leverage and inflation. On productivity, made good strides, but there's still a lot of work to do there and we know the job ahead of us. It's hard to improve productivity much in the fourth quarter, because it's just a period of like maximum stress on the operations, and we're trying to fulfill every order in a very quick way. But we\u2019re -- our goal is to leave ourselves in a really good, strong condition for a fast start on a lot of initiatives in Q1 of next year. On fixed cost leverage, we've taken steps to alter our forward plan and take CapEx out. A lot of the CapEx we spend in any given year is feeding future years' capability. And we've tightened that up. We feel good about the arc of demand versus supply that we have in our fulfillment and transportation area. Inflation is a wildcard. We do as much as we can to save money in an inflationary environment. We've looked to make sure that our trucks are fully utilized as best we can, preventing long-zone shipments, things that like use a lot of fuel or use a lot of trucking or use a lot of shipments from other parts of the world. So we're working under the umbrella of not having it impact the customer. We're working very hard to save that. Those challenges will be there through the end of the year, and we'll be working on them definitely in the first half of next year as well. So we'll keep you posted as we have these quarterly calls on our progress and where we see opportunities.\nOperator: And our final question will come from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Just two clarifications on what you just said. So, first, on retail, you did see some good efficiency gains in 3Q, and you talked about $1.5 billion. As we look forward, if those three areas you just mentioned do turn favorable, how quickly do you think you could get back to kind of historical North America retail operating margins? Is that 1 year, two years? Any time frame on that? And then, on AWS, you said the back half of 3Q was a mid-20s run rate. One of your prominent peers was talking about incremental macro weakness in 4Q. So could you just talk about, are you expecting the same thing in 4Q, or are some of the price concessions you already made in 3Q kind of getting in front of that? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Was that second question on AWS, Ross?\nRoss Sandler: Yes, AWS trajectory. Exactly.\nBrian Olsavsky: Okay. Let me start with the efficiency. I just outlined a lot of it in the prior answer. But just to clarify, we were aiming for about $1.5 billion improvements sequentially versus Q2 and Q3. We feel like we came up about $0.5 billion short on that. Primarily -- mostly in our productivity we have a lot of -- with the Prime Day and the preparations for the Prime Early Access event, we have been running with very high inventory levels in our warehouses. But our inventory and our sellers, as we get ready for those events, paid off in the events themselves. In-stocks have been at really high levels. But in that environment, it's a little harder to work on. There's, blockages to making improvement in productivity. There's a lot of extra work when you have space constraints. But we will continue that fight. And while I can't forecast into 2023 yet, and I'm not really only talking about Q4. My message is that we have work to do in 2023, that we are aware of and working on today. Dave, do you want to take that question on AWS?\nDave Fildes: Yeah, this is Dave. Ross, you were just asking around AWS. There's nothing really I'd add to what Brian had already said other than he's spoken about. We've seen the year-over-year growth rate come down as the third quarter progressed and exited in sort of the mid-20s growth rate. And so that's informed how we're thinking about the guidance ranges heading into the fourth quarter, but nothing else to add on that.\nEnd of Q&A: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon. And we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you everyone. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. And have a great day."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-07-28 21:06:03", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2022 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 28, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks for joining today's call. Before we get the questions, I'll make some comments about our Q2 performance and the outlook for Q3. Let's start with Q2. During the quarter, we saw improvement in many of our key operational metrics, including in-stock levels and delivery speed and saw a subsequent step-up in consumer demand. For the quarter, worldwide net sales of $121.2 billion exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range and represented an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding approximately 320 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. This was a larger foreign exchange headwind than the 200 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q2 guidance. As a reminder, our revenue growth accelerated to over 40% growth from the period between May 2020 and May 2021. While demand has remained strong, the lapping of this high growth period, depressed our revenue growth rate for the following 12 months ending in May of this year. Our growth rates going forward will no longer require this historical explanation. Q2 of last year was also when vaccines had become more available, particularly in the United States and we began to see more normal shopping patterns. Prime Day also occurred in Q2 last year and contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate. This year's Prime Day sales event occurred on July 12th and 13th, and is incorporated into our third quarter guidance. As the impacts of the last two years are normalizing, we are happy with how we've served customers and how they have responded. Our compound annual growth, since the start of the pandemic, stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we are seeing prior to the pandemic. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic. Over that period, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. We continue to improve the customer experience in Q2, including quarter-over-quarter improvements in delivery speed and inventory in stock levels. We have also moved quickly to adjust our staffing levels and improve the efficiency of our significantly expanded operations network. We have slowed our 2022 and 2023 operations expansion plans to better align with expected customer demand. While there's still work to be done, we've made good progress in Q2. Our Prime membership program remains a key driver of our worldwide stores business, and we continue innovating to make the membership even more useful and valuable. That includes the upcoming premier of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power on September 2 and exclusive access to NFL Thursday Night Football games starting September 15. Our seller community also had a strong Q2. Third-party sellers represented 57% of all units sold on Amazon in Q2, the highest percentage ever. Selling partners helped to expand the selection we can offer customers while fulfillment by Amazon provides sellers the ability to offer fast delivery. Operating income was $3.3 billion in the quarter, above the top end of our guidance range. Last quarter, I discussed several cost pressures facing our worldwide stores business; inflationary costs, fulfillment network productivity, and fixed cost deleverage. Recall that these amounted to approximately $6 billion of incremental costs in Q1 when compared to Q1 2021. We've made solid progress in reducing these costs. For the second quarter, incremental costs were in line with our expectations at approximately $4 billion when compared to Q2 2021. Inflationary pressures remained at elevated levels in Q2, similar to what we saw in Q1. These include pressures from higher fuel, trucking, air and ocean shipping rates, which we expect will continue into Q3. We made strides to improve fulfillment network productivity in Q2. Staffing levels were more in line with rising Q2 demand, and we saw better optimization of our fulfillment network. On the transportation side, we've continued to improve delivery route density and improve package deliveries per hour. We are encouraged by the progress during the quarter and see opportunity to further improve in the second half of the year. Lastly, the year-over-year negative impact of fixed cost leverage was relatively consistent with Q1. There are two main drivers when talking about fixed cost leverage. First is the unfavorable comparison to very high holiday level utilization rates that we saw in the first half of 2021. And second is the normal step down in volumes off of our Q4 peak that we saw in first half of 2022. On the first point, we expect this challenging year-over-year comp will have ended in Q2. On the second point, we expect fixed cost leverage to improve in the second half of the year as we continue to grow into our capacity. We've also taken steps to slow future network capacity additions. Let's turn to AWS. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in AWS, where net sales were $19.7 billion in Q2, up 33% year-over-year, and now represented an annualized sales run rate of nearly $79 billion. AWS continues to grow at a fast pace, and we believe we are still in the early stages of enterprise and public sector adoption of the cloud. We see great opportunity to continue to make investments on behalf of AWS customers. We continue to invest thoughtfully in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs, while expanding AWS to new regions, developing new services and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. Developers at organizations of all sizes, from governments and not-for-profits to start-ups and enterprises, continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Delta Air Lines, Riot Games, British Telecom, and Jefferies' Investment Bank to name a few announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. AWS operating income was $5.7 billion in Q2. As a reminder, this includes a portion of our seasonal Q2 step-up in stock-based compensation expense. AWS results include a greater mix of these costs, reflecting wage inflation in high demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers as well as increasing technology infrastructure investment to support long-term growth. Now let's talk about capital investments. As usual, we will discuss the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2021, we incurred approximately $60 billion in capital investments. About 40% of that is comprised of technology infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS as well as our worldwide stores business. Another 30% of the $60 billion was fulfillment capacity and a little less than 25% was for transportation, remaining 5% was comprised of things like corporate space and physical stores. For full-year 2022, we do expect to spend slightly more on capital investments than last year, but the proportion of capital spending shifts among our businesses. We expect technology infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, primarily to support the rapid growth in innovation we are seeing with AWS. We expect infrastructure to represent a bit more than half of our total capital investments in 2022. For the worldwide stores business, we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with customer demand. We expect the fulfillment and transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. Finally, I'd highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $2 billion in the second quarter, while we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I point out that this net loss includes a pretax valuation loss of $3.9 billion, which is included in non-operating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. In the U.S., we've started making customer deliveries using the Rivian electric delivery vehicles. This rollout is the start of what we expect to be thousands of EDVs in more than 100 cities by the end of the year and 100,000 vehicles across the U.S. by the year 2030. Additionally, note that all of our share and per share information included in our financial materials has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split, which was effective on May 27th. We also provided our third quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. Again, a reminder that this year, our Prime Day sales event occurred on July 12th and 13th, and is incorporated into our third quarter guidance. Prime Day occurred in Q2 in 2021. For revenue, note that our guidance includes an estimated approximately 390 basis points of unfavorable impact from year-over-year change in foreign exchange rates. The estimated FX impact to operating income is not significant. Our third quarter operating income guidance range is zero to $3.5 billion. This compares to Q2 operating income of $3.3 billion. This third quarter guidance assumes, we see approximately $1.5 billion in quarter-over-quarter sequential cost improvement in our fulfillment network operations, which we expect will be largely offset by investments in AWS and additional digital content for Prime members. For AWS, this quarter-over-quarter increases are primarily driven by higher infrastructure investments to support continued strong customer growth, including larger depreciation on a growing fixed asset base. We also expect increased energy costs as we continue to see volatility in utility prices around the world and operating our AWS data centers. Quarter-over-quarter increase in digital content primarily relates to new Prime Video content in Q3, including Thursday Night Football and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. Thank you. And now let's move on to your questions.\nOperator: At this time, we'll now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Brian, I wanted to just talk a little bit about the bridge from 2Q to 3Q EBIT guide a little bit. It sounds like you're going to have revenue up nicely. You talked about the efficiencies of the $1.5 billion quarter-over-quarter and some of the incremental investments in content, et cetera. Where are the other areas where you're sort of investing more to grow and is any of that associated with merchandise margin or step-ups in discounting? That would be the first one. And the second one is kind of going back to your comment about you \u2013 how you've slowed 2022 and 2023 operations expansion plans. How should we think about the fulfillment and transportation CapEx sort of looking into the fourth quarter into next year? How far ahead of this build have you gone through for the last, call it, nine months? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks, Brian. Let me start with your second question. So in any particular year when we're spending capital, a good portion of it, we estimate about 40% this year is being spent in support of warehouses or transportation capacity. That will be opening up and effective in 2023 and beyond. So there's always a pre-spend to keep the \u2013 again, the pipeline moving. So when we make adjustments to the time horizon, the impact is not as great as you might expect in the year 2022. Again, we have moved things out and capital is coming down in those areas as we just mentioned. We'll just have to keep you posted as we go quarter-to-quarter on what our expectations are. On the bridge to Q2 to Q3, so again, you have the \u2013 mentioned three items, ops improvement that we see of a $1.5 billion and offsetting that is increased costs in AWS, as we build out depreciation. We also are adding \u2013 continuing to add people in that space; product engineers, salespeople, customer support. Speaking more broadly, we know AWS is a huge opportunity to early days in the adoption curve for companies and governments. And we invest with that - with that confidence in mind and customers have responded and we're going to keep investing there. Your comment on discounting, we're not seeing some of the pressures that other people are seeing right now. Our macroeconomic issues are principally on inflation and pretty transparent on that. I think the new thing this quarter is additional pressure on the energy, electricity rates in our data centers because of the ramp up in natural gas prices, if you've seen that. So that's probably the new information and then the other inflationary factors. Well, some of them are coming down slightly. They're still significantly a penalty year-over-year. Other cost pressures are principally on our cost of employees. If you look at our stock-based comp as a percent of revenue, it's gone up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter, as we stepped up from Q1 to Q2. We see that pattern every year, but we don't see that magnitude and that's where a lot of our wage inflation is for particularly our technical employees. So there's a certain amount of conservatism always built into this because we are in a very difficult macroeconomic state potentially. Again, we're not seeing it hit our businesses directly. In fact, we're seeing strong growth in sales through the quarter in Q2. But we're cognizant that things could change quickly and we'll see and monitor and that's how we set our forward guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I wanted to ask about AWS. Some of your peers in the cloud space have talked about some slowdown in booking rates just as customers take longer to work through deal terms and duration. So if you could comment on whether AWS is seeing similar dynamics? And then also when you think about margins, the 35% for AWS in 1Q going to 29% in 2Q, what are some of the puts and takes that we should think about going forward just given decreasing server life benefits and tougher macro environment? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Doug. I'll start with second question. So on margins in AWS, yes, as you mentioned that is dropping sequentially. The margin rate is going to fluctuate and this business is going to be always a factor of new investment and things like the sales force and new regions and infrastructure capacity offset by infrastructure efficiency gains that we see. Pricing issues as we extend contracts, we've seen really good progress with our customer base, longer and longer commitments, really committing to the cloud, some of that comes with credits to help them make their conversion to the cloud and so that the revenue pattern can be, and the margin on that revenue can fluctuate quite a bit quarter-to-quarter, but see a lot of strength in the business right now. We're very happy with the growth rate. We're happy with the adoption of the cloud. As you hit a potential rough patch in the economy, I think the last time we saw this was back in 2008-ish. And it\u2019s hard to draw lessons from that, but we did notice that it did help our cloud business at the time because again, when you're trying to launch a new product or service and you have to face with building your own data center and getting capital for a data center and building it yourself or moving to the cloud and essentially buying incremental infrastructure capacity, the cloud computing really shows its value. So we're prepared \u2013 just like when the slowdown in 2020, we are prepared to help customers optimize their costs and will help them any who are scaling down. But we'll also, again, continue to find new customers and new industries including government agencies and happy with that. And if you look again, where our investments been over the last few years and the growth of our sales force and our sales support, it's starting to \u2013 it is showing benefits, and we expect that to continue. On your \u2013 sorry, your other question was, is that\u2026\nDouglas Anmuth: Just about current trends in terms of booking rates\u2026\nBrian Olsavsky: Got it. I blended into one answer.\nDouglas Anmuth: Yes, you blended that.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Hopefully that covered what you\u2019re asking about.\nDouglas Anmuth: Yes, it does.\nBrian Olsavsky: Doug, just to \u2013 I mean, just to pile on to that too. I mean, I think just the longer term vision I probably talked about here, we're right now with 84 availability zones. So that's 26 geographic regions, and we've got plans for \u2013 to launch 24 more of those availability zones across eight regions. And this is Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, UAE, so a lot of different spots. And so continuing to focus on building out to customers, working on that pipeline and building longer commitments, making \u2013 finding customers that are making longer commitments is really important to that. And just to that point, the backlog figure that we've discussed in the past and disclosed on a quarterly basis on our filings, it's up 65% year-over-year or about 13% quarter-over-quarter and the weighted average remaining life of those long-term commitments that we're talking about here continues to grow. So it's at about 3.9 years on a weighted average remaining life basis. So again, a lot of good work, a lot of still good opportunity out there to come, and as Brian talked about, we're working hard in many facets and investing in that to make sure we're in good position to serve folks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two-parter on the advertising business, where you saw continued strength. Is there any way to give us an update of how much of the advertising services line at this point is driven by North America e-commerce versus international e-commerce, and how you think about the relative growth rates and advertising going forward between North America and international? And the second part would be away from the e-commerce-driven parts of advertising. How are you feeling about the positioning and the investments you need to make around things like Connected TV and programmatic advertising, where from the outside in it looks like you're continuing to make greater levels of investment and increasing your exposure to a wider array of advertising products? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Great. Hi, Eric. Thanks for your questions. I would say on the geographic split, we haven't broken that out. The majority of advertising revenue is in North America, but having said that, we are making great strides in international as well. And we're also, as you mentioned, expanding our array of advertising products from our consumer websites to video opportunities, Twitch and others. Dave, do you want to take the second part of that?\nDave Fildes: Yes. I think it was \u2013 Eric, it was a question around kind of interactive work. I mean, we've got \u2013 one of our main priorities is building relevant and engaging ad experiences. And so, we of course, introduced interactive ads last year for streaming video content, things like Freevee. We've got Amazon Music as ad supported tier as well for audio ads. So looking for opportunities like that, where customers can more easily engage with brands while streaming content. So I think there's a lot of good opportunity for that, but what's great, video advertising, as you mentioned, it's still early in that space, it's increasingly coming mainstream and then viewing behaviors have really shifted away from some of the more traditional cable or kind of traditional viewing and advertisers are using our ad- supported content to reach those viewers. So things that are ongoing we've talked about around Freevee, around Twitch, and then of course, some things we're obviously excited about it. Thursday Night Football and Amazon streaming TV ads capabilities that we're going to continue to work with these partners and work with our own kind of technology capabilities to keep building out.\nBrian Olsavsky: Eric, I'd just add a little more on advertising because you're probably wondering again about softness \u2013 potential for softness in that or macroeconomic factors. Right now, we still see strong advertising growth. Again, it's got be a positive both for the customer and for the brand. I think our advantage is that we have highly efficient advertising. People are advertising at the point where customers have their credit cards out and are ready to make a purchase. It's also very measurable. And when people are looking, companies are looking to potentially streamline or optimize their advertising spend, we think our products compete very well in that regard. In addition to maybe longer term things like brand building and brings new selection to bear in front of customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. If I can ask two. So you called out just the 3P mix being a kind of highest level, maybe talk about your focus to increase the mix to 3P and how that fits into plans for improved efficiency? And then secondly, on international, how much of the weakness in the margin sequentially was FX-driven? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Let me start on your first one. So challenge the premise is a little bit there about incenting mix, sorry, I believe that is how I interpreted your question. We are relatively indifferent as to whether some customer buys a third-party or first-party product from us. We're all about obviously is price selection and convenience. And 3P particularly helps us with selection. And when it's part of FBA can also help as being more Prime eligible and available to ship in one, two days or whatever the Prime offer happens to be. So we're happy with the selection that we've added from third-party sellers. And I think that shows in the percentage mix that you see. We're proud of the investment we've made to build tools and products that allow sellers to be successful on our site. And it's a great partnership and it's worked really well. Sellers and vendors are also some of our larger advertising customers as well and helps \u2013 that advertising helps them surface new selection to our customer base. So it's a very strong partnership and it's been getting stronger. And I think you'll see also that they had a very big part in our Prime Day earlier this month.\nDave Fildes: Yes. Jason, on your second question related to the international and the profitability there, reported there's a foreign exchange exposure there on that segment with the operating income, there's included in there about $231 million of unfavorable impact to that segment included in that $1.7 billion loss for the quarter. Just looking \u2013 broadly speaking at what's going on with that business and the losses that we're seeing there in the investments, I think it's important to remember it's early in many of our international countries, particularly in some of our emerging or more recent launch countries, places like India, Brazil, the Middle East, there are others as well, of course, but where we've been operating in many of those cases considerably shorter than the tenure we've had in the U.S. In our established international locations, UK, Germany, Japan, over time, we've continued to improve the profitability of that business as we build out and established stronger customer relationships and work on the cost structure and how we serve folks. A lot of that, of course, is driving improvements through our key pillars with price selection and convenience and working with vendors on commercial terms. In our emerging locations, there's a healthy amount of investment we've done to drive expansion. And we expect to continue to do that, given the strong competition across many of these markets and that's investments in Prime Video, not just in some of the flagship shows that are kind of sourced here in the U.S., but also you've seen us continue to push for opportunities for in-country and local language the video content that resonates with customers and can be a meaningful reason people sign-up for the Prime program, engage and renew. And we're also investing depending on the regions and kind of the local infrastructure [indiscernible], whether it's building out payment methods, third-party transportation services, even in some cases, the Internet and the telecom infrastructure. So we're playing a role along with others. It's not just us investing in ways to create and enable that infrastructure to be successful. So those are some of the opportunities and challenges that you think about kind of where we are in the U.S. versus international that are out there. The network complexities, of course, there are some regulatory hurdles and other differences out there. But we think it's important to continue to invest in those opportunities and learn from what we're \u2013 not just in what we've done in the history with the U.S., but also in many of these countries and keep that flywheel spinning and continue to serve customers in more efficient ways.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you. I have two questions. One, can you discuss the impact, the price action you took on Prime, on merchant fees, et cetera, had on retention during the quarter, and do you feel that that's enough to offset the inflationary pressure we're seeing to date? And then on Buy with Prime, I know it's early, but how do you see the rollout of this initiative from it being by invitation only today to all merchants using FBA to \u2013 Amazon merchants, et cetera, and just kind of the implications on \u2013 broader implications on the business from that initiative? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Thank you, Youssef. So first on the \u2013 let's take them one at a time. So on the Prime fee increase earlier in the year, we're happy with the results we're seeing in the Prime program. Prime membership and retention is still strong. I think that change has been above our expectations positively. And I think the benefit of the program continues to get better and better. And as I mentioned in-stocks never been higher, delivery speed is increasing. So not to mention a lot of the new content, especially on the video side that will be coming in the fall. So we feel good about the program and the state of the Prime members after a very rough couple years of pandemic turmoil. And we think it's good base to build upon. So on the seller fee again, we added that fee grudgingly in May to compensate for some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing. I don't want to give you the idea that either of those fee increases came close to covering our costs. You can see from our operating results, some of it's internal related, but a lot of it's external factors that they're \u2013 we are not passing through that at a 100% to external groups. And it\u2019s \u2013 we've got to work our way out of the condition we are in and we are making good progress in Q2 and expect to keep pressing on that in the second half of the year, but saw strength in the seller results in Q2, as we mentioned on the percentage mix. So I think, seller business remain strong in an integral part of our customer offering.\nDave Fildes: Youssef, this is Dave. On your Buy with Prime question, yes, I mean, right now, it's allowing U.S.-based Prime members to shop directly from merchants on the online stores. And it's what they experience, they expect and kind of come to expect with Amazon that's the fast free delivery that seamless checkout and the free returns on orders that are eligible. Right now the program is available, as you mentioned, invitation-only for merchants that are already using FBA. And it'll expand throughout this year as we'll extend more merchants to invite and participate in the program. We're interested in learning and working with FBA sellers that we've known and had good trust with, but also expanding. And I think as you think about it, merchants, they obviously have a lot of choices on where they're going to sell products. And we have a long history of empowering and helping merchants. We've invested a lot in tools and capabilities, and of course, the delivery capabilities and all the things that go along with that. But that's an opportunity for us to support merchants who may or may not be FBA sellers with the tools and the opportunity just to sell their products online and scale their business and build their brand. And so I think I\u2019m really excited about, of course, getting to be able to launch this program over the last few months and dialing it up for more sellers as the year progresses.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you. So Brian, I think you just reported a quarter-on-quarter decline on headcount, which was by design after what happened last quarter, but it won't be too long before you are gearing up for the holidays. So how do you think the environment is going to fair for you to be adding headcount? And also the stock-based compensation came in below, where you had guided for the second quarter. So is this a matter of not hitting the hiring goals you were hoping for, or do you think the environment for the hiring of technical and engineering talent is losing up a little bit? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Stephen. Thank you. On the headcount, yes, I think it was more as we mentioned last quarter \u2013 last year \u2013 excuse me, in Q1, we added \u2013 to give you a flavor for it, we added 14,000 workers in Q1, prior year we had reduced our net headcount by 27,000. So we\u2019re pretty transparent about the fact that we had hired a lot of people in Q1 for the coverage of the Omicron variant, luckily that variant subsided and we were left with a higher headcount position that has come down through adjusting our hiring levels and normal attrition and \u2013 was pretty much resolved by the end of April or early part of May. So that is dominating the quarter-over-quarter reduction in headcount. I would note that we're still up 188,000 year-over-year and nearly double the headcount of what we had heading into the pandemic in early 2020. So you're right, there will be adjustments to that as we move forward into more holiday level demand. Right now, we see a stabilization in the workforce, maybe we see good hiring rates. And so I think as you remember, there was a very difficult labor period in the second half of last year, and it didn't arrived kind of quickly out of nowhere. So we're certainly diligent on that and making sure we have a good workplace and an environment that will attract employees.\nDave Fildes: And Stephen on your \u2013 just to your question on stock-based comp, as you mentioned, we do utilize restricted stock units or RSU as our primary mode of equity compensation. And as we always remind you, employee annual RSU grants do occur in the second quarter. And as a result, we typically see a step-up in the SBC expense from Q1 to Q2 and of course, you saw it this time around. The growth in the line is impacted overall also on the step-up by continued headcount. We've grown our workforce over the last few years. And as Brian talked about hiring in a number of areas of the business, including engineers, other tech workers, and there's some component of the wage inflation as we look to continue to hire and retain employees there. In terms of the coming in at the five \u2013 little over $5 billion for stock-based comp, the main driver there was primarily driven by fewer employees stock awards vested \u2013 excuse me, fewer employee stock awards we\u2019re vesting in Q2 than we expected.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again, next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-28 20:27:05", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2022 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 28, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining today's call. I'd like to start with a few comments on what we're seeing as we're coming out of the pandemic, both on the customer experience side and on the operating cost side in this current inflationary environment. Let's start with demand and customer experience. Worldwide net sales in Q1 were $116.4 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is the top end of our guidance range of $112 billion to $117 billion. Our compound annual growth since before the pandemic stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we were seeing before the pandemic. Our prime members continue to be a key driver of growth. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic, and we continue to see consistently high member renewal rates. We also added millions more new Prime members during the quarter. Throughout the past two years, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. In the first quarter, we made encouraging progress on key customer metrics. Delivery speed performance is now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020. And we now have the widest selection ever available for Prime's fast delivery. We have worked to protect and enhance the customer experience despite a sharp increase in costs, particularly over the past three quarters. We've seen a large cost to keep up with demand these past two years. During this period, we doubled the size of our operations and nearly doubled our workforce to 1.6 million employees. Labor and physical space are no longer the bottlenecks they were throughout much of 2020 and 2021. However, we continue to face a variety of cost pressures in our consumer business. We'll break these into two buckets, externally driven costs, primarily inflation; and internally controllable costs, primarily productivity and fixed cost deleverage. The externally driven costs are a result of intensifying inflationary pressures throughout Q1. Line haul air and ocean shipping rates continue to be at or above the rates in the second half of last year, which were already much higher than pre-COVID levels. Some of this is due to the impact of the Omicron variant in China and labor shortages at point of origin, and the start of the war in the Ukraine has contributed to high fuel prices. For example, the cost to ship in overseas containers more than doubled compared to pre-pandemic rates. And the cost of fuel is approximately 1.5 times higher than it was even a year ago. Combined with the year-over-year increases in wage inflation, these inflationary pressures have added approximately $2 billion of incremental costs when compared to last year. While we will continue to look for ways to mitigate these costs, we expect they will be around for some time. The next bucket of costs related to productivity and fixed cost leverage, which we consider to be more within our control and are working to reduce. These additional costs correspond to the state of the labor force and fulfillment network following two years of disruption and large demand variability. We now look forward to more predictability in our consumer order patterns and greater stability in our operations. Let's start with labor. As a reminder, in the second half of 2021, we were operating in a labor-constrained environment. With the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021, we saw a substantial increase in fulfillment network employees that on leave, and we continue to hire new employees to cover these absences. As the variant subsided in the second half of the quarter and employees returned from leave, we quickly transitioned from being understaffed to being overstaffed, resulting in lower productivity. This lower productivity added approximately $2 billion in costs compared to last year. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into April, we've seen productivity improvements across the network, and we expect to reduce these cost headwinds in Q2. The last issue relates to our fixed cost leverage. Despite still seeing strong customer demand and expansion of our FBA business, we currently have excess capacity in our fulfillment and transportation network. Capacity decisions are made years in advance, and we made conscious decisions in 2020 and early 2021 to not let space be a constraint on our business. During the pandemic, we were facing not only unprecedented demand, but also extended lead times on new capacity. And we built towards the high end of a very volatile demand outlook. Now that demand patterns have stabilized, we see an opportunity to better match our capacity to demand. We have lowered our operations, capital expenditures for 2022 and are evaluating other ways to increase our fixed cost leverage. We estimate that this overcapacity, coupled with the extraordinary leverage we saw in Q1 of last year, resulted in $2 billion of additional costs year-over-year in Q1. We do expect the effects of these fixed cost leverage to persist for the next several quarters as we grow into this capacity. When you combine the impacts of the externally driven costs and the internally controllable costs, you get approximately $6 billion in incremental costs for the quarter. Approximately two-thirds of these costs are within our control. And with demand normalizing, we remain focused on rightsizing our cost structure and driving out any cost inefficiencies. Our guidance includes an expectation that we will incur approximately $4 billion of these incremental costs in Q2. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in the AWS segment, where net sales were $18.4 billion in Q1, up 37% year-over-year and now represent an annualized sales run rate of nearly $74 billion. Developers at organizations of all sizes from governments and not-for-profits to start-ups and enterprises continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Telefonica, Verizon, Boeing, MongoDB, Amdocs, Bundesliga, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the NHL and Thread announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. We also continue to build support infrastructure to best serve AWS' millions of customers. We recently completed the launch of our first 16 local zones in the United States with 32 more to come across 26 countries. Local zones extend AWS regions to place our services at the edge of the cloud near large population, industry and IT centers, expanding our infrastructure footprint and enabling customers to build with single-digit millisecond latency performance. Last quarter, I provided some detail on our overall capital investments. So, let me add to that with our current thinking. First, as a reminder, we look at the combination of CapEx plus finance leases. Capital investments were $61 billion on the trailing 12-month period ended March 31. About 40% of that went to infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS, but also supporting our sizable consumer business. About 30% is fulfillment capacity, primarily fulfillment center warehouses. A little less than 25% is for transportation. So, think of that as the middle and last-mile capacity related to customer shipments. The remaining 5% or so is comprised of things like corporate space and physical stores. For full year 2022, we do expect infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, in large part, to support the rapid growth in innovation we're seeing within AWS. We expect infrastructure should represent about half of our total capital investments in 2022. For the consumer business, as I said earlier, we currently have some excess capacity in the network that we need to grow into. So, we've brought down our build expectations. Note again that many of the build decisions were made 18 to 24 months ago, so there are limitations on what we can adjust midyear. That said, we expect fulfillment dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. We also expect transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be flat to slightly down. Finally, I'll highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $3.8 billion in the first quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net loss includes a pretax valuation loss of $7.6 billion, included in nonoperating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. You may remember that we had a $12 billion gain on Rivian in Q4. We also provided our second quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. As a reminder, our comparable period of Q2 2021 included the continuation of extraordinary net sales growth in roughly the first half of that quarter. That began to moderate in the second half as vaccines became more readily available in many countries and people started getting out of their homes. In addition, note that this year's Prime Day sales event will occur in the third quarter, in July to be specific. Last year, in 2021, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter. Prime Day contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate. Lastly, as you look at our Q2 operating income guidance, a reminder that we will see our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense as our employees receive annual restricted stock unit grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see stock-based compensation expense of approximately $6 billion, up from $3.3 billion in Q1, largely reflecting wage inflation as we continue to hire and retain employees in high-demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers. With that, let's move on to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks. I want to ask two questions, please. In terms of the revenue guide for the June quarter, I think it sort of implies about 3%. And if you look sequentially and if you look back at the last couple of years, the non-COVID years, the growth has been between 4% and 6%. Are you seeing signs of consumer softness or weakening? Is there any particular factor that would be -- cause your sequential growth to be lower than typical? And then briefly on the margins for Q2. So, you got $4 billion in kind of these incremental costs versus $6 billion in the March quarter, but yet your guidance year-over-year implies kind of the same sort of year-over-year margin decline, about 500 bps. Could you just explain that a little bit? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Hi Mark. How are you doing? On revenue, yes, the revenue guidance we've given is kind of our best view of what we're seeing right now. Customer demand does remain strong. We're seeing, again, continued strength in Prime purchases, Prime commitment, levels of usage, benefits being used, et cetera. And the big part of the year-over-year comp is that we're comping the last part of the very elevated year-over-year step-up that lasted about half of last year's second quarter, and then we move Prime Day to Q3. So, we're not seeing softness. We're cognizant of the current inflationary environment and the impact it has on consumer -- or excuse me, the household budgets, a lot of times that is a time when -- and people come to Amazon because they know we have great prices and selection and convenience. So, it can go one of two ways. But we don't see any macroeconomic factors generally in this forecast on the demand side. We definitely see it on the cost side.\nDave Fildes: And Mark, I think your second question was related to the operating income guidance and some of the detail there. So, as Brian said, the first time we've given the guidance for the second quarter. But you detailed a number of pieces, but like you said, expect to see, in aggregate, about $4 billion of pressure for the 3 buckets that Brian talked about, higher inflationary pressures, lower productivity and some fixed cost deleverage persisting into Q2. So, that will be at some lower levels as we aim to and kind of expect to see some improvement in productivity, some of those other areas. We're also committed to just generally reducing variable cost per unit and working to lever our fixed costs, specifically where we have those controllable cost buckets Brian spoke about. The other thing -- again, Brian mentioned it towards the end there of this opening -- to see that seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense. So, recall that our employees received those RSU grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see the expense of approximately $6 billion. And so, that's up from about $3.3 billion in the first quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Big picture, Amazon hasn't really been around during a period of high inflation. How do you think about passing through the higher input costs through pricing? When you look at your units, they're flat and you're just not seeing any price increases in there. I know FX is a headwind, but how do you think about passing that through? And when can we start to see that? And then, second question, it looks like your shipping costs are up 14% versus units flat, probably makes sense with the input costs. But we would expect some savings as you bring a lot of that transportation in-house, a lot of the delivery in-house. Is -- are you seeing savings there? And how do you think about shipping costs versus units? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me make a comment on units first. If we step back, the first year of the pandemic from -- essentially from our world from the middle of May 2020 to May 2021, we saw high growth. We went from a 20% growth rate in revenue to a 40% growth rate almost overnight and held it for a year. And then, we started to lap that for the last year that will essentially end in the middle of this next month. And so, I noted step-downs in the run rate as soon as the middle of May hit last year. So, on units though, units grew during that -- instead of jumping from -- to 40%, they jumped to the mid-40% to 50% range, mainly because of the product mix, people were buying a lot more gloves and cleaning agents and all the things tied to the pandemic. So, there's a lot of -- you have to look at the unit data with keeping that in mind because there's a mix -- heavy mix issue. But putting all that aside, you asked the question about transportation shipping rates. Our shipping rates are very competitive, and we are seeing savings versus what we would get from external carriers. And it's beyond that. We would not even necessarily have had the capacity to -- from external third-party providers to handle the transportation loads that we've seen in the last couple of years. So, we're really glad that we have our -- as we built our AMZL network, we would not be able to have a one-day program, same day and one-day shipments, if we try to deliver it with third-party shippers. It just would not be cost effective. So, what you're seeing there in the growth in shipping costs versus the unit growth, a little bit on the unit side, but essentially a factor of inflation and productivity that I've mentioned to you on the component that hits in the transportation area.\nDave Fildes: Justin, on your second point regarding inflation, of course, we've talked about we're not immune to inflationary pressures on the cost side and with the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the start of the war in the Ukraine since our last quarter. We see larger impacts of inflation, some line haul, shipping rates, fuel shipping supplies and wages, which we talked about in some recent quarters as well. And we also see some volatility in utility pricing for some of the energy costs in operating the AWS data centers. Now, when you look at costs for customers and sellers in terms of product pricing, I just reinforce our pricing philosophy hasn't changed. We aim to offer low competitive pricing and try to stay on top of that pricing environment and make sure we're delivering a great price for customers. For our 1P business, that means continuing to be really competitive in that space with low prices relative to the reputable competitors out there and staying really close to that on the data. For third-party, we don't control that price that's set by third-party sellers. So, they're running their own businesses and we'll adjust the pricing to account for inflationary costs in their environment as well. And of course, on pricing and another other many other services with sellers, we offer services to help them not only handle with logistics, but also get better pricing information to make sure that they're staying on top of that as well. So, wherever we can help them, we do that. We did increase some fees effective, I believe, is today related to the FBA sellers and some surcharge there. We're focused on, of course, addressing permanent costs and ensuring our fees are competitive versus those charged out there by their sellers. But it's still unclear if the inflationary costs will go up or down and so -- and for how long they'll persist. So, rather than a permanent fee change, we implemented that fuel and inflation surcharge for the first time. And it's, of course, a mechanism that's broadly used across the supply chain providers that are out there already, but it's the first time that we've done something like this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Thomas: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one, Brian, I want to ask you about one day, same day. Now that you're getting inventory selection, SKU selection in some cases back to where it was pre-pandemic. What are you seeing from a demand or an elasticity perspective as you get more inventory available for one day, same day? Is it really leading to incremental sales based on your data? And the second one, I want to ask about tech and content. It came in a little higher despite AWS costs coming in lower. Is there anything else we should sort of be thinking about in our modeling in tech and content, whether it's Kuiper or other items that are moving through that line item for the year?\nBrian Olsavsky: Let me start with your first question on one day and same day. Yes, we're approaching the service levels that we had pre-pandemic, and that's a positive sign. But this doesn't -- it doesn't turn on a dime, I think as a consumer, I noticed it myself, I see more things in stock. And I -- it opens up the consideration set for things that I may have had to run to a store to get in a short period of time. And that trust and -- as you see more and more of that, you trust it and you continue to order and you then go to Amazon first and say, okay, well, it's maybe my first stop before I even think about going to the store. So, it's a -- it has to be built over time. It doesn't take years. It takes hopefully, weeks and months. But we're hopeful and expecting that that will add to good elasticity, the same elasticity is that we start to see prepandemic?\nDave Fildes: On the second point, the technology and content. Just as a reminder, components in there is you got the Amazon Tech and the AWS infrastructure, so everything from servers, network and equipment, data center-related depreciation, rent utilities, those types of things. The AWS Tech employee costs and costs to support the dotcom website and a number of other technology initiatives that we're working on. For Q1, it was up about 19% year-over-year, which was down a little bit, less than what you see for year-over-year growth throughout 2021. That growth rate, though, does, of course, include an offset Q1 2022 related to a partial offset, I should say, related to the change in estimated useful lives for servers, which was a little under $1 billion of impact in the first quarter. In terms of just the investment areas, I just reinforced it, it\u2019s continued investment in the tech infrastructure. One of the bigger pieces remains AWS, of course, there. And then, just broadly speaking, inclusive of AWS, the headcount to support -- the build-out and support that the AWS team is doing as well as some consumer tech teams, Alexa and Echo devices and certain other areas there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for the question. You talked about how you're no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity and, in fact, you're actually running at in excess at the moment. So, hoping you could talk a little bit about how long you think it could take to regain some of the productivity and cost efficiencies in the fulfillment network. Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure thing. Well, let me start with productivity. We began and ended the quarter with essentially 1 billion -- excuse me, 1.6 million employees, 1.6 million employees, mostly -- most of them, of course, are in operations. During the quarter, we had a peak of 1.7 million, and we were able to work that down by the end of the quarter. So, we have certain ability with contractors and all to adjust headcount. But for the most part, our employees are what we call blue badges or permanent Amazon employees. And now, we work on getting productivity up. It's a combination of productivity at the employee level, but it's also a matter of productivity of the -- and harmonization of the network, having the right demand in the right -- excuse me, the right capacity and the right demand matched at the warehouse level and the transportation node level. So, that's what we're working on. And we've made good strides in the last month, and we're -- we see a line of sight to getting back, not all the way to prepandemic rates in the next quarter or two, but a good bit of the way. And that's what we're firmly focused on and working on, and that's in the warehouses and also in transportation. Is there a second half to that question? Okay. Go ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. And I hope you're both well. Maybe if I could, just sticking on the capacity issues for a minute. In terms of the $4 billion number you're calling out, maybe the first part of the question would be, is that entirely the additional issues that are now front and center versus the issues we talked about from Q4 into first half of '22 from a logistics and supply chain standpoint where we had talked about permanent versus transient cost nature of that $4 billion as you move through the first half of the year? So, is this above and beyond that and above and beyond some of the lingering COVID costs that you had called out in prior periods? Just wanted to unpack some of the stack build of the $4 billion versus thing we already knew before. And then, maybe following up on Doug's question and asking it a little bit differently. When you look out to the back part of the year, not asking for how you might guide. But there's a typical cadence to fulfillment expense build and employee build and headcount build into the back part of the year as you build the capacity towards the holidays. Will that have a very different cadence to it this year because you find yourself with this much excess capacity at Q1, Q2 versus prior years, just so we can keep that front of mind? Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Sure thing. Good questions, Eric. Let me start with the cost penalties. So, in Q4, we did mention $4 billion of cost penalties and drag on that quarter. And $1 billion of that was fixed cost deleverage, principally a combination of having enough space and having super high leverage in the prior year when we were chasing volume and had less space. And we indicated that that would be carrying over into 2022 and it has. From a productivity standpoint, our issues in the second half of last year were different. They were -- we didn't have as much labor, even though we added, I believe, was 200 -- I have it right here, 270,000 workers in the second half of last year. We were chasing labor and it was creating much disruption within our network. Long zone shipments, half full trucks, all kinds of negative consequences of not having labor, but we made it through Q4 with the anticipation that we'll be able to hold our labor for Q1 and labor certainty would be a lot better and certain in our network. That is still the plan, and we're probably a couple of months late on that because of some of the issues with Omicron in January. And our reaction to it was that uncertain labor environment where a lot of people were on leave. We hired more people and then found ourselves overstaffed when the Omicron variant subsided rather quickly, at least from our standpoint in warehouses. So, the issue is switched from disruption to productivity losses to overcapacity on labor. And we believe that that will dissipate. It will take time in Q2, but -- so it's not the full -- we don't get the full $2 billion back in Q2, but we will make great strides on that. Inflation has been in both periods. Inflation was in the transportation costs, especially in wage inflation last year. It remains there. It's been amplified a bit by the fuel costs following the Ukraine conflict, which has happened since we last spoke. So, it's more a factor -- those costs will now, we believe, will persist a little longer than we were hoping at the beginning of the year. And I mentioned some of the per unit rates for transportation, cargo shipments and also fuel costs. Those are real, and we have to find ways to offset those or use less of high-cost things, like transportation and fuel. So, we're working on that. As we progress, there's only guidance for Q2. But what we see is that the fixed cost deleverage will narrow as we go through the year, and we'll be really glad we have this capacity in Q3 when Prime Day hits because that's always a big surge of both, inventory and orders, and then definitely in the holiday season. So, we will -- the way we see it as we've come out of a very tumultuous two years. We are glad we made the decisions we made over the past two years. And now we have a chance to more rightsize our capacity to a more normalized demand pattern. So, what's left there is really inflation, and that's what we're working on and evaluating and finding ways to mitigate and in some cases, having to pass some of the costs through to third-party sellers as well so that we're not subsidizing sales there. And then, we will see. So, we expect the year-over-year revenue comps to improve in the second half of the year because, again, we're passing this year of super high growth that I mentioned before from May of 2020 to May of 2021. But, it's not like the volume has receded. Like, in Q1 literally, where revenue 61% higher over two years from 2020. So the way to think about it is it went up and stayed up and now it's -- it will resume a more normal growth pattern. But I wouldn't be full by the revenue growth rates in this difficult comp period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: So, the letter mentioned some impacts post the Ukraine invasion. I'm guessing it's mostly on the inflation and the fuel costs just mentioned. But any comment about how revenue trajectory compared in March after the conflict started versus before across your geographies? And is there any noticeable difference between Prime member volume and non-Prime? Thanks a lot.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Hi Ross. No, I would say there's not a lot of Prime versus non-Prime differential. We had what we consider to be a very strong March. It's very hard to compare year-over-year because March last year was the height of some stimulus payments in the United States. But from kind of a sequential period, we thought March was strong. So, there's no indicators that we're seeing of weakness in consumer demand, but we're wary of it as probably all companies are because household budgets are tightened when fuel costs are doubling and a big part of your -- it ripples through food, it ripples through everything else. So, we're cognizant of that. But what we'll focus on is the customer experience, continue to get our delivery times to be better and increasing selection, which is better than pre-pandemic time period and you're making the customer experience great on a lot of dimensions.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Two questions. Just can you talk about advertising a bit? Are you seeing supply chain disruption having any impact on advertising? Just any comments there? And then, second, I don't think AWS backlog was asked. If there's any numbers you can share on AWs backlog growth this quarter versus last quarter. Thanks.\nDave Fildes: Yes. Jason, I'll take the second one first, just on the backlog. So, yes, I mean, we're continuing to see what the backlog is, right? It's the increase of AWS customers making long-term commitments for AWS. At the March period ended, we had $88.9 billion balance for that. So, that's up about 68% year-over-year. And the weighted average remaining kind of life term for those is 3.8 years.\nBrian Olsavsky: And on revenue -- excuse me, advertising revenue was up 25% year-over-year, and that's a strong run rate compared to the revenue growth rate. So, we're still very happy and pleased with the way the advertising team is performing and how advertising has been valued by both, sellers and vendors and others who use it to reach our customer base at the point where they're considering purchases. So, a strong quarter and continue to roll out new and new products for sellers to manage their advertising and increase the ability to analyze and calculate the payback on marketing investments with us.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."}], "2024": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 4, "year": 2023, "date": "2024-02-01 21:04:04", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2023 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022.  Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's use as of today, February 1, 2024, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially, additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.  During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions.  Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.  Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't include any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements, it's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Jassy: Thanks, Dave. Today we\u2019re reporting $170 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, $13.2 billion in operating income, up 383% year-over-year, or $10.5 billion and $35.5 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $48.3 billion year-over-year.  While we've made meaningful progress in our financial measures, what we're most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, adjusting and reimagining from teams across Amazon.  Looking back at Q4, I'll start with our stores business where customers responded to our continued focus on selection price and convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection with hundreds and millions of products available and added tens of millions of new items last year alone, including fashion selection from Coach, Victoria's Secrets Fashion, Pit Viper, and Beyonce\u2019s Renaissance to our Merge to cosmetics from Lancome, Urban Decay, cosmetics and No Beauty by Vanessa Hudgens, to consumer technology and services from Boost, Infinite, and Woop to homewares for Martha Stewart.  Being sharp on price is always important. But particularly in an uncertain economy where customers are careful about how much they're spending. We kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, which was open to all customers and ended up being our largest event ever. These events also helped attract new customers and Prime members.  Throughout the quarter customers saved nearly $10 billion across millions of deals and coupons almost 70% more than last year. In addition to offering great deals, we continue to improve delivery speeds. In 2023, Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day including more than 4 billion in the U.S and more than 2 billion in Europe.  In the U.S this result is the combination of two things, one is the benefit of regionalization, where we\u2019ve architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same day facilities, where in the U.S in the fourth quarter, we increase the number of items delivered the same day or overnight by more than 65% year-over-year. As we're able to get customers items this fast. It increases the number of occasions that customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs. And we can see that in all sorts of areas including how fast or everyday essentials business is growing.  Our regionalization efforts have also brought transportation distances down which has helped lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we've reduced our cost-to-serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S alone, cost-to-serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit compared to the prior year. Lowering cost-to-serve allows us not only to invest in speed improvements, but also afford adding more selection at lower average selling prices or ASPs and profitably. We have a saying, that it's not hard to lower prices, it's hard to be able to afford lowering prices. The same is true with adding selection, it's not hard to add lower ASPs selection, it's hard to be able to afford offering lower ASPs selection and still like the economics. Like improving speed, adding selection puts us in the consideration set for more purchases.  As we look toward 2024 and beyond, we're not done lowering our cost to serve. We've challenged every closely held belief for our fulfillment network and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there's more upside for us.  Alongside our stores business, our advertising growth remains strong, up 26% year-over-year, which is primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We've recently added Sponsored TV to this offering in the U.S. a self-service solution for brands to create streaming TV campaigns with no minimum spend, putting this advertising within reach of any business.  While still early days, streaming TV advertising continues to grow quickly. Brands are using our capabilities to reach engage viewers on Twitch, Freevee, Fire TV and Prime Video shows and movies, which just launched in the U.S., as well as Thursday Night Football.  Shifting to AWS. Revenue in the quarter grew 13% year-over-year in Q4 versus 12% year-over-year in Q3. And we're now approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $100 billion. We watched the incremental revenue added each quarter and in Q4 AWS added more than $1.1 billion an incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue, which on an FX neutral basis is more than any other cloud provider as far as we can tell. While cost optimization continued to attenuate larger new deals also accelerated, evidenced by recently inked agreements with Salesforce, BMW, NVIDIA, LG, Hyundai, Merck, MUFG, Axiata, Cafe, BYD, Arcore, Amgen, and SAIC.  Our customer pipeline remains strong, as existing customers are renewing larger commitments over longer periods and migrations are growing. 2023 also was a very significant year of delivery and customer trial for generative AI or Gen AI in AWS. You may remember that we've explained our vision of three distinct layers in the Gen AI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of which were deeply investing. At the bottom layer, where customers who are building their own models run training and inference on compute with a chip is the key component in that compute, we offer the most expansive collection of compute instances with NVIDIA chips.  We also have customers who would like us to push the price performance envelope on AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips, which are 40% more price performance than other X86 alternatives. And as a result, we built custom AI training chips, named Trainium, and inference chips, name Inferentia. At re:Invent we announced Trainium2, which offers four times faster training performance and three times more memory capacity versus the first generation of Trainium, enabling advantageous price performance versus alternatives.  We already have several customers using our AI chips including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh and Snap. In the middle layer where companies seek to leverage an existing large language model, customize it with their own data, and leverage AWS\u2019 security and other features all as a managed service. We've launched Bedrock which is off to a very strong start with many 1,000s of customers using the service after just a few months.  The team continues to rapidly iterate on Bedrock, recently delivering capabilities including guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, knowledge bases to expand models knowledge base with retrieval augmented generation or RAG and real time queries, agents to complete multi step tasks and fine tuning to keep teaching and refining models. All which will help customers applications be higher quality and have better customer experiences.  We also added new models from Anthropic, Cohere, Meta with Llama2, Stability AI and our own Amazon Titan family of LLMs. What customers have learned at this early stage of Gen AI, is it there's meaningful iteration required in building a production Gen AI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customers don't want only one model, they want different models for different types of applications, and different size models for different applications.  Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple and this is what Bedrock does, which is why so many customers are excited about it. And to top layer of the stack is the application layer, one of the very best early gen AI applications is a coded companion. At Reinvent, we launched Amazon Q, which is an expert on AWS, writes code, debugs code, tests code, does translations like moving from an old version of Java to a new one and can also query customer\u2019s various data repositories, like Internet, Wickes or from over 40 different popular connectors to data in Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Elastin or Zendesk, among others. And answer questions, summarize this data, carry on a coherent conversation and take action. It was designed with security and privacy in mind from the start, making it easier for organizations to use generative AI safely. Q is the most capable work assistant and another service that customers are very excited about. By the way, don't underestimate the point about Bedrock and Q inheriting the same security and access control as customers get with AWS. Security is a big deal, an important differentiator between cloud providers. The data in these models is some of the company's most sensitive and critical assets. With AWS' advantaged security capabilities and track record relative to other providers, we continue to see momentum around customers wanting to do their long-term Gen AI work with AWS. We're building dozens of Gen AI apps across Amazon's businesses, several of which have launched and others of which are in development. This morning, we launched Rufus, an expert shopping assistant trained on our product and customer data that represents a significant customer experience improvement for Discovery.  Rufus lets customers ask shopping journey questions like what is the best golf ball to use for better spin control or which are the best cold weather rain jackets and get thoughtful explanations for what matters and recommendations on products. You can carry on a conversation with Rufus on other related or unrelated questions and retains context coherently. You can sift through our rich product pages by asking Rufus questions on any product features and will return answers quickly. We're at the start of what Rufus will do with further personalization and expansion coming, but we're excited about how it will make discovery even easier on Amazon. Gen AI is and will continue to be an area of pervasive focus and investment across Amazon, primarily because there are a few initiatives, if any, that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes, and we believe it will ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years. In addition to our stores and AWS businesses, we continue to make progress on newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long term. Touching on two of them. In October, we had a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper, which is our low earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400 million to 500 million households who don't have it today. We launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space and successfully validated all key systems and subsystems, made a 2-way video call, streamed a Prime Video movie in Ultra HD 4K and made an Amazon purchase over our end-to-end communication network. It's rare to be able to exercise all these elements in an initial launch like this. We're on track to launch our first production satellite in the first half of 2024 and started beta testing in the second half of the year. We've still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by our progress. During the quarter, we also completed our second season of Thursday Night Football, which was a rousing success by all accounts. The customer experience continued to improve as our talent, production, streaming quality, analytics, unique AI features like Prime Vision and defensive alerts, all took big leaps forward on top of the very good start last year. We launched a new NFL tradition with the inaugural Black Friday football game and our continuous innovation resonated with viewers as the number of people watching increased 24% year-over-year and with advertisers as we made dramatic year-over-year gains in ad sales. We have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own, and we'll continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for Prime members like Thursday Night Football, Go To The Rings, Reacher, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Citadel and more. And with the ads in Prime Video, we'll be able to continue investing meaningfully in content over time. I'll close by reiterating that 2023 was a really good year. I'm grateful to all of our teams who delivered on behalf of customers. Yet I think every one of us at Amazon believes this is just the start of what's possible. We have a long way to go in every one of our businesses before we exhaust how we can make customers' lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we're investing. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Andy. Overall, we saw strong performance in the fourth quarter. Worldwide revenue was $170 billion, representing an increase of 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and approximately $3 billion above the top end of our guidance range. Saw our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever, which was $13.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $10.5 billion year-over-year and $2.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. For the full year 2023, we had a meaningful improvement across our financial results. Revenue was $574.8 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Operating income tripled year-over-year to $36.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $35.5 billion, up $48.3 billion versus last year. These financial outputs are a result of a lot of improvements in our key input metrics such as stores' cost to serve, which decreased year-over-year for the first time since 2018 and our ability to deliver to customers at our fastest speeds ever. I want to thank our customers, our partners and our teammates around the world for a very strong 2023 performance. Focusing on the fourth quarter, North America revenue was $105.5 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year and an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. International revenue was $40.2 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, also an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. During the quarter, we remained focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers, price, selection and convenience. Our shopping events throughout the quarter included Prime Big Deal Days in October and our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping event helped to attract new Prime members and deliver billions in savings for customers. We made meaningful progress on delivery speeds in the United States and globally, which helped strong sales throughout the quarter, including notable strength in the last-minute gifting where our ability to provide fast shipping helped our Prime members ensure that they got their gifts before the holidays. These improvements in delivery speed have led to increased purchase frequency by our Prime members across all of our major geographies. It also strengthened demand for our everyday essentials. Categories like beauty and health and personal care, where speed is even more important to customers. Third-party sellers were a big part of our success over the holidays with worldwide third-party seller services revenue growing at 19% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 61%, its highest level ever. We also saw strong performance in worldwide advertising, which grew 26% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products as our teams worked hard to increase the relevancy of the ads we show customers by leveraging machine learning. Advertising only works if the ads are helpful to customers and there's a lot of value in tailoring sponsored products, so they are relevant to what a customer is actually searching for. We're also continually focused on improving our measurement capabilities, which allow brands to see the payback of their advertising spend. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $6.5 billion, an increase of $6.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 6.1%, up 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins were at their recent low levels in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen seven consecutive quarters of improvement resulting in a cumulative improvement of 800 basis points over these past seven quarters. In addition to the strong top line growth, which helped to drive improved leverage throughout our businesses, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost to serve. The fourth quarter is our busiest time of year, supported by an increasingly large and integrated operations network. Overall, our teams executed extremely well, yielding strong efficiency gains with minimal disruptions. We were pleased with the performance of our regionalized network during the holiday period, where we saw benefits from improved inventory placement helping drive faster speeds and also lowering costs. We also continue to see benefits from lower transportation rates, which include linehaul, ocean and rail and from a more stable labor market, resulting in improved staffing levels. In our International segment, we had an operating loss of $419 million, an improvement of $1.8 billion year-over-year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through increased units per box, lower transportation rates and leverage across our fixed costs as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations. The International segment represents more than 20 countries of varying degrees of growth and our largest established countries like the U.K., Germany and Japan, relatively strong revenue growth contributed to the year-over-year improvement in profitability. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they continued to expand their customer offerings, while seeking to invest wisely. Moving to AWS. Revenues were $24.2 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $1.1 billion of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, we continue to see the diminishing impact of cost optimizations. And as these optimization slow down, we're seeing more companies turning their attention to newer initiatives and reaccelerating existing migrations. Customers are also excited about our approach to generative AI. Still relatively early days, but the revenues are accelerating rapidly across all 3 layers and our approach to democratizing AI is resonating well with our customers. We have seen significant interest from our customers wanting to run generative AI applications and build large language models and foundation models, all with the privacy, reliability and security they have grown accustomed to with AWS. AWS' operating income was $7.2 billion, an increase of $2 billion year-over-year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 29.6%, up more than 500 basis points year-over-year and effectively flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This margin improvement reflects our headcount reductions from earlier in the year and a slowdown in the pace of hiring. Shifting to free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $35.5 billion, an improvement of $48.3 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, which we are seeing across all three of our segments. We're also seeing improvements in working capital, notably in inventory efficiency driven by our regionalization efforts. Next, let's turn to capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, full year CapEx was $48.4 billion, which was down $10.2 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by lower spend on fulfillment and transportation. As we look forward to 2024, we anticipate CapEx to increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased infrastructure CapEx, support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI and large language models. One thing I'd like to highlight in our first quarter guidance is that we recently completed a useful life study for our servers and we are increasing the useful life from 5 years to 6 years beginning in January 2024. We will have this anticipated benefit to our operating income of approximately $900 million in Q1, which is included in our operating income guidance. As we turn the calendar to 2024, we are excited to continue upon the great work the teams have been able to deliver in 2023. We remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in an effective way that reduces costs and also allows us to continue innovating and inventing for customers. With that, let's move on to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. \nEric Sheridan : Thank you so much for taking the questions. I'm just going to do a 2-parter on AWS. If we take a step back, can you talk a little bit about the contribution from backlog conversion, AI workloads and some elements that allowed you to reaccelerate revenue at AWS in Q4 and how we should think about those components from an exit velocity standpoint into 2024? And then against your broader comments on CapEx, any color on how we should be thinking about AI-driven CapEx within the AWS initiatives against the broader CapEx commentary? Thank you. \nDave Fildes: Yes, that's right. This is Dave. Just to give you that -- the balance was $155.7 billion as of 12/31. So that's up more than $45 billion year-over-year and $20 billion quarter-over-quarter.\nBrian Olsavsky: And then if you look back at the revenue growth, it accelerated to 13.2% in Q4 as we just mentioned. That was an acceleration. We expect accelerating trends to continue into 2024. We're excited about the migrate -- continuous their resumption, I guess, of migrations that companies may have put on hold during 2023 in some cases and interest in our generative AI and products, like Bedrock and as Andy was describing that. On the CapEx side, let me talk in total for the company. We had $48 billion in 2023 was down $10 billion year-over-year. We talked about during the year quite a bit. A lot of the mix of investment in 2023 was tied to infrastructure, mostly supporting AWS but also supporting our core Amazon businesses was about 60% of our spend. So it reached a very high percentage. We anticipate those trends continuing into 2024. CapEx will go up in 2024. I'm not giving a number today, but we do -- we're still working through plans for the year, but we do expect CapEx to rise as we add capacity in AWS for region expansions, but primarily the work we're doing with generative AI projects. In the fulfillment center and logistics area, I would say it's more incremental capacity at this point based on additional demand, although we are seeing some additional investments for same-day delivery sites and automation, robotics. But the trend for most of the large percentage of the spend will be in infrastructure is going to continue into 2024.\nAndrew Jassy: I\u2019ll add a few things to what Brian said. I think just as it relates to the first part of the question, just the way to think about backlog conversion is just these are deals that we've signed that are long-term deals typically with customers. And then there's some amount of time it takes where we work with those customers to migrate those workloads. And so some of the trends that we have seen over the last quarter.  First of all, I think that the lion's share of cost optimization has happened. It's not that there won't be any more or that we don't see anymore, but it's just attenuated very significantly. And at the same time, what we've seen is that migrations and this speaks to some of the backlog, migrations that were proceeding, but maybe not at the pace that we saw before, have started to pick up again. We've also seen that a number of the deals that typically signed more quickly, but were signing more slowly in more uncertain environments. A lot of those got done in the last quarter, and you heard in my opening remarks some of the examples, but that was some of several, and we're continuing to see that trend.  And then on the Gen AI side, it's -- if you look at the Gen AI revenue we have, in absolute numbers, it's a pretty big number, but in the scheme of a $100 billion annual revenue run rate business, it's still relatively small, much smaller than what it will be in the future, where we really believe we're going to drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue over the next several years. But it's encouraging how fast it's growing and our offering is really resonating with customers.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. \nBrian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Andy, the first one is sort of on the cost to serve comments coming down for the first time since 2018. As you sort of look into '24 and '25, can you just sort of walk us through some of the key operational blocking and tackling this to happen to continue to drive down that cost of serve back to 2018 levels? Or however you're thinking about your North Star from that perspective?  And then the second one is on sort of philosophical about capital returns. It looks like the cash balance could start building pretty nicely here. How do you think about the idea of buybacks, share repurchases or some type of capital return programs to sort of help shareholders out?\nAndrew Jassy: Thank you, Brian, I appreciate it. I'll take the first, and I'll let Brian take the second. On the cost to serve coming down, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I don't think that we feel like where we're going to ultimately be. I think we feel like we have meaningful upside there. And I think one thing that it's easy to make as large a change as we made in regionalization in the U.S. and saying, check, we got that done. But the reality is, we still have several improvements and a bunch of ways that we can hone the regionalization improvements that we made in 2023 and in 2024. And so when the team speaks about the areas where they believe they have opportunities, there's still opportunities just in regionalization as we continue to hone that, but I also think, in many ways, it was very useful for us to go through what was a pretty significant change we went through during the pandemic, where we doubled the size of our fulfillment center network in 18 months and built out a last mile transportation network, the size of UPS in 18 months, it was disruptive to get that optimized. But one of the things that was very useful was, it really caused us to relook at everything we were doing with fulfillment network. And we looked at it really a beginner's eye and we have found so many areas that we believe that we can evolve that I think will both help our cost to serve and even more importantly, deliver faster delivery speeds for customers. And I mentioned one area which, in particular, which you'll see us focus on over the next year or two is just, we think there are real opportunities in our inbound network and our inbound processes. And then where we locate inventory in association with that, which will accomplish both of those tasks. But for us, I don't believe that we believe that 2018 is the North Star in cost to serve. I think we believe we can keep evolving it and being better than that.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, I'd just add a couple of other items there. We've gotten a lot better at fixed cost controls, as we scale. And I think you're seeing that as part of our ability to lower cost per serve not only in operations, it's actually throughout the company. And we're seeing a reduction in some of the inflationary factors that hit us in -- especially hard in 2021 and 2022, things like transportation services, fuel and others. So not totally out of the woods there, but coming down, and we still see some more upside. On your share repurchase question, first of all, just really excited to actually have that question. No one's asked me that in three years and appreciate it. But we have come through a tumultuous period where, as Andy just said, we doubled the size of our logistics footprint and invested heavily in -- we saw that negative free cash flow, at least on our all two calculation for the period 2021 to 2022. So we're glad to see the improvement in the bounce back in free cash flow. A lot of -- and we do debate and discuss capital structure policies annually or more often. And I have nothing to announce today, but again, we primarily think we have a lot of strong investments in front of us. We're good -- we're glad to have the liquidity -- better liquidity at the end of 2023, and we're going to try to continue to build that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. \nDoug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, you've seen very good improvement in International profitability over the last several quarters. Can you just talk about some of the levers here that you're thinking about just as you look to move into positive operating income and then how International could potentially approach North America levels over time? And then just a follow-up there. Are you seeing any shipping disruptions currently related to the Red Sea and does that factor into your outlook at all for 1Q? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Let me start with the second one first. So we're mindful of the geopolitical issues around the world, especially as you say in the supply chain and how that might impact shipments both to the U.S. and to Europe. We're just working very hard to make that not back up on customers, and we'll continue to work that. It's not a material impact into the -- it estimated in our guidance in Q1. But again, as I said, we're vigilant on that, and we'll work to take steps where we need to, to make sure that customer experience is not impacted. On the International segment, operating income, yes, we're very pleased with the results, especially over the last few quarters. We improved operating income by $1.8 billion year-over-year. And I would attribute it to the steady progress that Andy was saying about the U.S. is, again, cost of serve down, advertising is stronger, a lot of attention to cost, a lot of attention to investments, and we are going to invest and other fixed cost control. So a lot of that is what we're seeing in the established countries of Europe and Japan. I would divide the segment a bit into a couple of buckets. First, there's that International segment, excuse me, European established country segment. And that's -- it behaves a lot like you would see in North America. If you look at the emerging countries, and again, we've launched 10 countries in the last 7 years. They're all on their own trajectory of journey to profitability and significance with customers, and we're pleased with that. I think they're all growing nicely and again, leveraging their cost structure, investing wisely and Prime benefits, but all on a curve to breakeven and then be a contributor to income and free cash flow. The other thing I'd point out is that we have advanced loaded, I would say, price benefits in our International markets. We think it's a very good source of customer acquisition and customer retention. The investment in those areas can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We had a bit of a higher spend in -- excuse me, in digital content in Q4 as we had a number of marketing and content, especially around live sports, English Premier League and Champions League in Germany and Italy, for example. But we like those benefits in those investments, different proven vehicle for customer acquisition, as I said, and it gets people shopping at our sites and engaging with benefits is always positive for the relationship with Amazon.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. \nMark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks. Two questions, please. I think you mentioned, Brian, that the North American margins have improved for 7 quarters in a row or something like that, a significant number. I would assume that most of the factors like rising capacity utilization given your CapEx commentary about retail, the regional center efficiencies and then overall, moderation in shipping and logistics costs, labor costs, I mean, all these factors probably mean that we'll continue to get an improvement in North American margins, but if you would comment on that.  And then secondly, on the Primetime Video -- Amazon Prime video, I know we just launched. But could you provide any color or context on expectations around that? You've got a massive number of Prime users who are coming in with a reasonable CPM with low ad load, but it seems like there should be a substantial opportunity for you. So if you want to try to size that for us or how you think about the upside, that would be really appreciated. Thank you. \nBrian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. Thank you. I think Andy laid it out pretty well a few minutes ago on the cost structure, the regionalization, the -- growing into the assets that we added during the pandemic, great efficiency and work with productivity across really all of our operations network fixed -- attention to fixed cost and lowering costs where we can, maintaining costs where we can, the increase in advertising, success in advertising revenue growth that's outpaced our traffic growth rates.  So all of those trends we expect to continue, and we're going to work hard to make sure they continue. And as we said, we have one guidepost is maybe pre-pandemic profitability, but we are working to -- we're not putting a limit on our improvement. We're going to continue to look for ways to lower the cost to serve. And I might add, at the same time, increase the customer experience because we did that -- we had that cost improvement at the same time when we at first got back to our shipping speeds from pre-pandemic and then exceeded them. So we're happy with that, and we'll continue to do both to improve the customer experience and also to lower our costs and leverage our cost structure. Yes, your second question on ads. I can't scale it right now. I mean what I would say for ads in videos is that advertisers are excited to access our Prime customer base. We are looking for ways to increase our advertising in our streaming properties, including Fire TV, but also -- and Prime Video, but also things like Freevee and Twitch.  And it's an important part of the total business model, and we expect it will allow us to have a healthy business to continue to invest in content and to continue to grow that. And we feel good about it, and the way we anticipate the ads progressing, we will not have heavy ad loads relative to see other network TV and other things. And like all of our advertising, we're trying to be useful for customers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. \nScott Devitt : Thanks. I have one on grocery and one on healthcare. First, on grocery, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the progress that you're making in unifying the offering between Dotcom, Fresh and Whole Foods. And as it relates to reverse logistics and using the grocery facilities, how that's lowering the cost of logistics and whether there is a significant opportunity there in terms of driving traffic and revenue in the grocery business?  Then secondly, on health care, in such a poor -- notoriously poor customer experience industry, you've made significant efforts now within acquisition and offering primary care. Just be curious if you could talk a little bit more about the longer-term vision in healthcare. Thank you.\nAndrew Jassy: Yes. On grocery, we're pleased with the progress we're making there. When we think about our grocery business right now and kind of, I'll call it, 3 big macro segments. The first is nonperishables where these are things like consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty products and pharmaceutical. And we -- it's a big business and it's continuing to grow at a very healthy clip, and we're really pleased with that business. And it's really the way the most mass merchandisers got into the grocery business a few decades ago. So that continues to grow at a very healthy clip. We have a physical presence along with online, but Whole Foods market, which is really the pioneer and the leader in organic grocery and that's continuing to grow at a very good clip. We also made a number of changes in the business last year on the profitability side, where we really like the profitability trajectory we see there. And so again, you'll see that keep growing and expanding and feel very good about that as well.  If you want to serve as many grocery needs as we do, you have to have a mass physical presence. And that's what we've been trying to do with Fresh over several years. We have tested -- we've been testing a V2 of our Fresh format in a few locations near Chicago, in a few locations in Southern California. It's very early. It's just a few months in, but the results thus far are very promising and on almost every dimension. And so we need to see it for a little bit longer time, but the results appear like we have something that's resonating. And if we continue to see that, then the issue becomes how fast and what's the best way to expand. We have also been spending increasing amounts of time and efforts here trying to make it easier for customers to be able to shop between the nonperishables and then our selection of Whole Foods as well as Fresh, I think you can expect to see that over time, both in the user experience on the app and on the website as well as how we're able to better leverage between the different business segments and their logistics capabilities, being able to get better leverage there, better economics and then allowing people to order in one conservative place to be able to pick up in multiple -- pick up for multiple types of grocery products in one place. Just seeing us already do more of that, and I think you can expect that in the future. In the healthcare space, I -- if you think about what we do on the retail side, adding a pharmacy capability is a pretty natural extension. It's something that customers had asked us for many years, and it's got more complexity to it than the rest of our retail business. So we have to think carefully about whether we wanted to pursue it, but customers so badly wanted it and the experience we thought could be better and we could be a meaningful part of changing that, that we pursued it.  And I really like the momentum that we're seeing in our Amazon Pharmacy business. It's growing really quickly. But even more important with how fast it's growing, if you've used it and you've paid attention to the customer experience over the last 12 to 15 months, it's just substantially improved from where it already was pretty good. People really love the experience. And I think that when -- the healthcare experience, particularly in the U.S. is a pretty frustrating one and not a very good one. And I think that when we tell our grandkids that the way we used to have to go get primary care was to make an appointment 3 weeks in advance and then drive 20 minutes to the doctor, park, wait in the reception for 15 minutes, get put into an exam room for 15 minutes. Doctor comes in, talks to you for 5 to 10 minutes and then you got to drive 20 minutes to the pharmacy.  People are just not -- our grandkids will not believe that was the experience and it's not going to be, and you already see that changing. And its part of what attracted us in such a significant way to on medical. It's just their application, their app is so easy to use. You have all your healthcare data in one spot.  You can do chats with medical practitioners. You can do video calls, if you need to see someone, there's physical locations and lots of metropolis cities where you can get in the same day, if you need to see a specialist, they're probably into specialists and all the cities in which we operate, where you can get in a day or two later, like just it's a very different experience. Now if you actually need medication, you can get that sent to you in a day or two, either through Amazon pharmacy or other pharmacies that we work with. And that experience is so much better than what we've been accustomed to seeing. And so I think it's -- again, it's still early days. We're excited, we launched for Prime members the ability to get one medical subscription for $9 a month or $99 a year, which is 50% off, the typical price and that saw a very good take-up.  So it's still early days, but we think we have an opportunity to be a meaningful part of changing that experience. And if we are helpful in changing what that primary care experience is and what it looks like to get pharmaceutical items, there's a lot of other things that we might be able to help customers with over time that whether it's wellness or whether it's diet, there's a bunch of areas that I think we can help over time.\nOperator: And our final question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nColin Sebastian : Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up on AWS for a moment. You outlined the generative AI stack, which I think is -- which is very clear. So I'm just curious maybe how you're going to market within the application layer given sort of the competitive dynamics of that. And then maybe expand, if you could, Andy, a little bit on the strategy for Gene AI on the consumer-facing side of the business. I know you launched Rufus today. Is that an area that you think could materially improve conversion rates and the overall consumer engagement on retail apps or what's your vision there? Thank you.\nAndrew Jassy: Yes. So Colin, I would say a few things on -- first on generative AI. It's -- when we talk to customers, particularly at enterprises as they're thinking about generative AI, many are still thinking through at which layers of those 3 layers of the stack, I laid out that they want to operate in. And we predict that most companies will operate in at least 2 of them. But I also think even though it may not be the case early on, I think many of the technically capable companies will operate at all 3. They will build their own models. They will leverage existing models from us, and then they're going to build the apps. And I know one of the other interesting things that we see early on right now in generative AI is that -- it's a very iterative process and real work to go from posing a question into a chat bot and getting an answer to turning that into a production quality application at the quality you need for your customer experience and your reputation and then also getting that application to work at the latency and cost characteristics that you need. And so what we see is that customers want choice. They don't want just 1 model to rule the world. They want different models for different applications. And they want to experiment with all different sized models because they yield different cost structures and different latency characteristics. And so Bedrock is really resonating with customers. They just -- they know they want to change all these variables and try and experiment and they have something that manages all those different transitions and changes so they can figure out what works best for them, especially in the first couple of years where they're learning how to build successful generative applications is incredibly important for them. So it's part of why we see Bedrock resonating so much. In the same way, what's attractive to enterprises when they think about coding companions like Q, is just if you can get 30%, 40% better productivity for your developers, which in many cases, for companies is their most scarce resource, it's a game changer. And they won't roll out every bit of code that comes from a coding companion. But if it can assist them to get 80% plus the way there quickly, that's a big deal. And one of the things that's unique about Q is it's not just a coding companion, yes, it's an expert on AWS. It will help you -- it helps you write the code, but it also helps you debug the code and it helps you test the code, helps you do transformations and it helps you figure out how a multistep implement features. There's a lot of -- helps you troubleshoot. If there's something in your application that's you write, you can find it and help you fix it. And so -- and then it also lets you look at all your data repositories, whether it's Internet or Wickes or the 40-plus data connectors like Salesforce, Alassian, and Zendesk and Slack. And let you have an intelligent conversation to get answers and take action. So it's a pretty differentiated capability there. And when enterprises are looking at how they might best make their developers more productive, they're looking at what's the array of capabilities in these different coding companion options they have.  And so we're spending a lot of time -- our enterprises are quite excited about it. It created a meaningful stir at reinvent. And what you see typically is that these companies experiment with different options they have and they make decisions for their employee base, and we're seeing very good momentum there. The question about how we're thinking about Gen AI in our consumer businesses. We're building dozens of generative AI applications across the company. It's every business that we have has multiple generative AI applications that we are building. And they're all in different stages, many of which have launched and others of which are in development.  So if you just look at our -- some of our consumer businesses, on the retail side, we built a generative AI application that allowed customers to look at summary of customer review, so that they didn't have to read hundreds and sometimes thousands of reviews to get a sense for what people like or dislike about a product. We launched a generative AI application that allows customers to quickly be able to predict what kind of fit they'd have for different apparel items. We built a generative AI application that in our fulfillment centers, that forecasts how much inventory we need in each particular fulfillment center. And so the start of the rollout of Rufus today is really just another step, but we think one that's pretty meaningful in being a generative AI powered shopping assistant and it's trained on our very expansive product catalog as well as our community Q&A and customer reviews and the broader web. But it lets customers discover items in a very different way than they have been able to on e-commerce websites. So if you want buying advice, like what should I look for in a pair of headphones or if you are doing purpose buying, like what should I buy for cold weather golf or comparisons, what's difference in lip-gloss or lip oil or you want recommendations of the best Valentine's Day gifts or you're on a detailed page with bridge product info, where you don't want to go through the whole page, you want to ask is this pickle ball rack that's good for beginners. All those questions you can pull in and get really good answers. And then it's seamlessly integrated in the Amazon experience that customers are used to and love to be able to take action. So I think that that's just the next iteration. I think it's going to meaningfully change what discovery looks like for our shopping experience and for our customers. And I could kind of step through every one of those consumer businesses. Our advertising business is building capabilities where people can submit a picture and ad copy is written and the other way around.  And you kind of think about Alexa, where we're building a very large -- expansive large language model is going to make Alexa even more productive and helpful for customer. Every one of our consumer businesses has a significant number of generative AI applications that they either have built and delivered or they're in the process of building. And I don't see that changing for many years. We have a lot of ideas.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-10-26 22:20:26", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2023 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2023, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Jassy: Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.1 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year; $11.2 billion in operating income, up 343% year-over-year or $8.7 billion; and $20.2 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases which is up $41.7 billion versus the comparable period last year. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we're making in lowering our cost to serve, improving our customer experiences and investing for future growth. I'll start with our stores business. Our move earlier this year from a single national fulfillment network in the U.S. to 8 distinct regions represented one of the most significant changes to our fulfillment network in our history. This change has gone more smoothly and made more impact than we optimistically expected. And you can see the benefits in many forms. Regional fulfillment clusters with higher local in-stock levels and optimized connections between fulfillment centers and delivery stations mean shorter distances and fewer touches to get items to customers. Shorter travel distances and fewer touches mean lower cost to serve. But perhaps most importantly, shorter distances and fewer touches mean that customers are getting their shipments faster. We remain on pace to deliver the fastest delivery speeds for Prime customers in our 29-year history. And as I talked about last quarter, we know how important speed of delivery is to customer satisfaction and buying behavior. A good example is the significant growth we're seeing in consumables and everyday essentials. When customers are getting items as quickly and conveniently as they are now from Amazon, they're going to consider us more frequently for more of their shopping needs. As we've shared the last few quarters, we've re-evaluated every part of our fulfillment network over the last year. The first substantial rearchitecture centered on the regionalization change. We obviously like the results but don't think we fully realize all the benefits yet and we continue to make steady improvements in fine-tuning the placement algorithms to enable even more in-region fulfillment and to further increase consolidation into fewer shipments. We've also identified several substantial changes to our inbound processes that we believe could have a significant impact on our cost to serve and speed of delivery. We have a long way before being out of ideas to improve cost and speed. The team is really humming on this and I'm proud of the way they're inventing and executing together. Moving to AWS and our investments in generative AI. AWS revenue grew 12% year-over-year in Q3, with $919 million of incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue and now has the annualized revenue run rate of $92 billion. AWS' year-over-year growth rate continued to stabilize in Q3. And while we still saw elevated cost optimization relative to a year ago, it's continued to attenuate as more companies transition to deploying net new workloads. Companies have moved more slowly in an uncertain economy in 2023 to complete deals. But we're seeing the pace and volume of closed deals pick up and we're encouraged by the strong last couple of months of new deals signed. For perspective, we signed several new deals in September with an effective date in October that won't show up in any GAAP reported number for Q3 but the collection of which is higher than our total reported deal volume for all of Q3. Deal signings are always lumpy and the revenue happens over several years but we like the recent deal momentum we're seeing. Top of mind for most companies continues to be generative AI. As I mentioned last quarter, we think about generative AI as having 3 macro layers, each of which is very large in each of which we're investing. A few updates there. At the lowest layer is the compute to train large language models, or LLMs and produce inferences or predictions. The key to this compute is the chip inside it. As we've shared, we've been working on custom silicon for training and inference with our Trainium and Inferentia chips, respectively. Recently, we announced that leading LLM maker Anthropic chose AWS as its primary cloud provider and will use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train and deploy its future LLMs. As part of this partnership, AWS and Anthropic will collaborate on the future development of Trainium and Inferentia technology. We believe this collaboration will be helpful in continuing to accelerate the price performance advantages that Trainium and Inferentia deliver for customers. In the middle layer which we think of as large language models as a service, we recently introduced general availability for Amazon Bedrock which offers customers access to leading LLMs from third-party providers like Anthropic, Stability AI, coherent AI 21 as well as from Amazon's own LLMs called Titan, where customers can take those models, customize them using their own data but without leaking that data back into the generalized LLM, have access to the same security, access control and features that they run the rest of their applications within AWS all through a managed service. In the last couple of months, we've announced the imminent addition of Meta's Llama 2 model to Bedrock, the first time it's being made available through a fully managed service. Also through our expanded collaboration with Anthropic, customers will gain access to future Anthropic models through Bedrock with exclusive early access to unique features, model customization and the ability to fine-tune the models. And Bedrock has added several new compelling features, including the ability to create agents which can be programmed to accomplish tasks like answering questions or automating workflows. In these early days of generative AI, companies are still learning which models they want to use which models they use for what purposes and which model sizes they should use to get the latency and cost characteristics they desire. In our opinion, the only certainty is that there will continue to be a high rate of change. Bedrock helps customers with this fluidity, allowing them to rapidly experiment with move between model types and sizes and enabling them to pick the right tool for the right job. The customer reaction to Bedrock has been very positive and the general availability is buoyed that further. Bedrock is the easiest way to build and scale enterprise-ready generative AI applications and a real game changer for developers and companies trying to get value out of this new technology. And the top layer which are the applications that run the LLMs, our generative AI coding companion Amazon CodeWhisperer has gotten a lot of early traction and got a lot more powerful recently with the launch of its new customization capability. The number one enterprise request for coding companions has been wanting these companions to be familiar with customers' proprietary code bases. It's not just having code companions trained in open source code, companies want the equivalent of a long-time senior engineer who knows their code base well. That's what CodeWhisperer just launched, another first of its kind out there in its current form and customers are excited about it. A few last comments on AWS's generative AI work. As you can tell, we're focused on doing what we've always done for customers, taking technology that can transform customer experiences and businesses but they can be complex and expensive and democratizing it for customers of all sizes and technical abilities. It's also worth remembering that customers want to bring the models to their data, not the other way around. And much of that data resides in AWS as the clear market segment leader in cloud infrastructure. We're innovating and delivering at a rapid rate and our approach is resonating with customers. The number of companies building generative AI apps in AWS is substantial and growing very quickly, including Adidas, Booking.com, Bridgewater, Clariant, GoDaddy, LexisNexis, Merck, Royal Philips and United Airlines, to name a few. We are also seeing success with generative AI start-ups like Perplexity.ai who chose to go all in with AWS, including running future models in Trainium and Inferentia. And the AWS team has a lot of new capabilities to share with its customers at its upcoming AWS re:Invent conference. Beyond AWS, all of our significant businesses are working on generative AI applications to transform their customer experiences. There are too many for me to name on this call but a few examples include, in our stores business, we're using generative AI to help people better discover products they want to more easily access the information needed to make decisions. We use generative AI models to forecast inventory we need in our various locations and to derive optimal last mile transportation routes for drivers to employ. We're also making it much easier for our third-party sellers to create new product pages by entering much less information and letting the models to the rest. In advertising, we just launched a generative AI image generation tool, where all brands need to do is upload a product photo and description to quickly create unique lifestyle images that will help customers discover products they love. And in Alexa, we built a much more expansive LLM and previewed the early version of this. Apart from being a more intelligent version of herself, Alexa's new conversational AI capabilities include the ability to make multiple requests at once as well as more natural and conversational requests without having to use specific phrases. We continue to be convicted that the vision of being the world's best personal assistant is a compelling and viable one and that Alexa has a good chance to be one of the long-term winners in this arena. Every one of our businesses is building generative AI applications to change what's possible for customers and we have a lot more to come. We're also encouraged by the progress we're making in our newer initiatives. Just to name a few, we're pleased with what we're seeing in Prime Video. Prime Video continues to be an integral part of the Prime value proposition where it's often one of the top 2 drivers of customers signing up for Prime. We also have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business in its own right as we continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for prime members but also offer the best selection of premium streaming video content anywhere with our marketplace offering, including channels for customers who can subscribe to channels like Max, Paramount+, BET Plus and MGM+, as well as our broad transaction video-on-demand selection. As we continue to invest in compelling content, beginning in early 2024, Prime Video shows and movies will include limited advertisements. We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. If customers prefer and add free option, we plan to offer that for an additional $2.99 per month for U.S. members. There is still a lot of work to be done in innovation ahead but we're excited about our future on Prime Video. We're seeing progress on a number of our investments that expand our ability to serve more consumers and sellers in their e-commerce missions. Our emerging international stores continue to improve their customer experiences and profitability and are on a strong trajectory. Both consumers and sellers are excited about Buy with Prime which enables third-party sellers with direct-to-consumer websites to offer Amazon Prime members the same fast payments and delivery options they receive on Amazon.com. We recently announced the capability for sellers to integrate Buy with Prime with their Shopify account, making it easier for Shopify merchants to manage their businesses with inventory pricing and promotions automatically synced in one place. And we're seeing very positive early response from sellers to Supply Chain by Amazon, a fully automated set of supply chain services where Amazon can pick up inventory from manufacturing facilities around the world, ship it across borders, handle customs clearance and ground transportation, store inventory in bulk, manage replenishment across Amazon and other sales channels and deliver directly to customers, all without sellers having to worry about managing their supply chain. Our health care team is continuing to make health care easier for people to access. The Amazon Pharmacy customer experience has significantly evolved this year and customers are responding that both in their purchasing behavior and qualitative feedback. We built RXPass for customers to get unlimited supply of eligible medications for $5 per month, meaningfully reduce the cost for customers to get insulin and diabetes products and partnered with Blue Shield of California to offer a first-of-its-kind model to provide more affordable pharmacy care to its 4.8 million members, providing fast and free delivery of prescription medications and 24/7 access to pharmacists. We remain convinced that we can be part of the solution of making health care a better customer experience. And our low Earth orbit satellite initiative Project Kuiper which aims to bring fast, affordable broadband to underserved communities around the world, took a meaningful step forward in the last few weeks with the successful launch of 2 prototype satellites. We will use this multi-month mission to test our satellites and network from space and collect data ahead of the planned start of satellite production later this year. I'd like to close by thanking our teams around the world who are gearing up for 2 of our most significant events across the company. First, our annual AWS re:Invent conference that begins on November 27. The team is excited to share a lot of new capabilities with customers and provide an array of opportunities for builders to learn and connect with one another. And on the stores side, we've already kicked off what will be our 29th holiday shopping season. Prime Big Deal Days held earlier this month was our most successful October holiday kick-off event ever, with Prime members saving more than $1 billion across hundreds and millions of items sold. Just as we do all year long, we aim to make our customers' lives easier and better every day and there's no time where it's more important to us that we deliver on this mission than during the busy holiday shopping season. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Andy. Overall, we saw a strong performance in the third quarter. Worldwide revenue was $143.1 billion, representing an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and approximately $100 million above the top end of our guidance range. We saw our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever which was $11.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $8.7 billion year-over-year from $2.7 billion above the high end of our guidance range. North America revenue was $87.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. And international revenue was $32.1 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange. During the quarter, we held our biggest Prime Day event ever with prime members purchasing more than 375 million items worldwide and saving more than $2.5 billion on millions of deals across the Amazon store. Outside of Prime Day, we continue to see strong demand across everyday essentials, including categories like beauty and health and personal care. From a customer behavior standpoint, we still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals, coupled with lower spending on discretionary items. Building on the momentum from last quarter, we set another record for delivery speed. For the year-to-date period through the third quarter, we have delivered at the fastest speeds ever in the United States. These improvements in delivery speeds have been a key driver of growth and are resulting in increased purchase frequency by our Prime members. Third-party sellers grew at 18% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by selection expansion and growing adoption of our optional services for sellers, including Fulfillment by Amazon and paid account management and more. During the quarter, we hosted Amazon Accelerate, our annual seller conference, where we launched a number of new innovations and product developments for our sellers, including Supply Chain by Amazon. We also continue to see durable growth in advertising which grew 25% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by sponsored products as we lean into machine learning to improve the relevancy of the ads we show our customers and enhance our measurement capabilities on behalf of advertisers. We have seen strong improvement in our profitability. North America operating income was $4.3 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 4.9%, up 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen 6 consecutive quarters of improvement, resulting in a cumulative improvement of over 700 basis points over these past 6 quarters. The third quarter marked the second full quarter of regionalization within the U.S. and we're pleased with the early results. Regionalization has allowed us to simplify the network by reducing the number of line-haul lanes, increasing volume within existing line-haul lanes and adding more direct fulfillment center to delivery station connections. We have also been focused on optimizing inventory placement in a new regionalized network which when coupled with the simplification mentioned earlier, is helping contribute to an overall reduction in cost to serve. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw benefits from lower inflation, primarily within line haul, ocean and rail shipping rates which were partially offset by higher fuel prices. While we are encouraged by the improvements in operating profit, we still see a lot of opportunity in front of us. In international, we were closer to breakeven during the quarter with an operating loss of $95 million. This was an improvement of $2.4 billion year-over-year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through higher productivity, decreased inflationary pressures and improvements in leverage across our established and emerging international countries as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations. Moving to AWS; revenues were $23.1 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $900 million of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, while optimization still remain a headwind, we've seen the rate of new cost optimization slowdown in AWS and we are encouraged by the strength of our customer pipeline. Customers are excited about our approach to generative AI, with several new announcements made during the quarter, including a strategic collaboration with Anthropic, opening Amazon Bedrock up to general availability, adding Meta's Llama 2 model to Bedrock in the near future and new customization capabilities of CodeWhisperer. AWS remains a clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position in the number of customers, the size of our partner ecosystem, our breadth of functionality and the strongest operational performance in the industry. When we look at the fundamentals of the business, we believe we are in good position to drive future growth as the rates of cost optimization slow down. AWS operating income was $7 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion year-over-year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 30.3%. This is an improvement of approximately 600 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by increased leverage on our head count costs. Shifting to free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $20.2 billion, an improvement of $41.7 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income which we're seeing across all 3 of our segments. Key drivers of this improvement include reductions in our cost to serve, continued advertising growth and improved leverage on our fixed costs. We are also seeing improvements in working capital, notably with our inventory efficiency as we improve our inventory placement. Now, let's turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. These investments were $50 billion for the trailing 12-month period ended September 30, down from $60 billion in the comparable prior year period. For the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be approximately $50 billion compared to $59 billion in 2022. We expect fulfillment and transportation CapEx to be down year-over-year, partially offset by increased infrastructure CapEx to support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments related to generative AI and large language model efforts. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are ready to make this a great holiday season for our customers. Looking at our operations network, our inventory is the best position it's ever been heading into the holiday season, enabling us to serve customers with fast delivery speeds from their local regions. We continue to believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin, your line is live.\nJustin Post: I'll ask about AWS. I guess the first question is, as you look forward in the fourth quarter, you mentioned you've signed some new deals. Are you seeing less cost optimization as you look forward? Or do you think it will be similar to Q3? And then second, you couldn't help but notice the big margin improvement in AWS all the way back to where you were 7 quarters ago. Could you talk about the drivers and sustainability of those margins?\nAndrew Jassy: Yes, Justin. Sure. This is Andy. I think if you look at AWS, we grew 12% year-over-year. And I think that you saw a continued stabilization of our year-over-year growth rate. And included $919 million of incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue which it's hard to compare and do the math across different players because not everyone discloses them clearly. But as far as we can tell, that also looks like the most absolute growth of any of the players out there. We're still seeing elevated customer optimization levels than we've seen in the last year or year before this, I should say. So if you look at the optimization, it's more than a year ago but it's meaningfully attenuating from where we've seen in the last few quarters. And if you look at the optimization too, what's interesting is it's not all customers deciding to shut down workloads. A very significant portion of the optimization are customers taking advantage of enhanced price performance capabilities in AWS and making use of it. So for example, if you look at the growth of customers using EC2 instances that are Graviton based which is our custom chip that we built for generalized CPUs, the number of people and the percentage of instances launched their Graviton base as opposed to Intel or AMD base is very substantially higher than it was before. And one of the things that customers love about Graviton is that it provides 40% better price performance than the other leading x86 processors. So you see a lot of growth in Graviton. You also see a lot of customers who are moving from the hourly on demand rates for significant portions of their workloads to 1- to 3-year commitments which we call savings plans. So those are just good examples of some of the cost optimization that customers are making in less certain economies where it's really good for customers short and long term and I think it's also good for us. But we're starting to see -- as I said, we're seeing that optimization attenuate. I expect that to continue over time. I remain very optimistic about AWS in the medium to long term. And it's because we have the most functionality by a large amount. We have a much larger partner ecosystem than you'll find elsewhere. We have stronger security and operational performance than you can find elsewhere. I think we're the most customer-focused. Even if you look during optimization times in this difficult economy, customers have really noticed how AWS leaned in with them for the long term. And I think that matters to customers. And then we have a $92 billion revenue run rate business where 90% of the global IT spend still resides on premises. And if you believe like we do, that equation is going to flip. There's a lot more there for us. And then you look at the very substantial gigantic new generative AI opportunity which I believe will be tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AWS over the next several years, I think we have a unique and broad approach that's really resonating with customers. And you can see it with the array of customers I mentioned that are using us and starting to build workloads for generative AI who have already on top of us. I could see it also. Just the growth rate for us in generative AI is very fast. Again, I have seen a lot of different numbers publicly. It's real hard to measure an apples-to-apples. But in our best estimation, our -- the amount of growth we're seeing and the absolute amount of generative AI business we're seeing compares very favorably with anything else I've seen externally. So I think that you can see that in the deals that we're doing, too. I spoke about the significant number of deals that we've closed over the last couple of months. A lot of those conversations, it's -- a big piece of it is what I mentioned earlier, the functionality, the ecosystem, the operational performance, the security, how you take care of customers but also whether or not they like your vision and set of products that you're building in this brand-new technology space, generative AI which I think has been very effective so far. So to me, I think there's a lot of growth in front of AWS. I'm very optimistic about it.\nBrian Olsavsky: And Justin, on your comment about -- a question about AWS margins. So yes, the margin improved 600 basis points quarter-over-quarter, an increase of income of $1.6 billion quarter-over-quarter for AWS, is driven by -- primarily by our headcount reductions in Q2 and also continued slowness in hiring, rehiring open positions. There's been also a lot of cost control in non-people categories, things like infrastructure costs and also discretionary costs. Natural gas prices and other energy costs have come down a bit in Q3 as well. So as we've said historically, the margins on -- the operating margin for AWS is going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and this is a good example of that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Can you just talk more about how the regional fulfillment network is exceeding your expectations? And then also, how does that support your confidence in moving North America beyond mid-single-digit margin levels? And then just perhaps on generative AI, obviously, a lot of innovation here. You talked about a number of different customers running early workloads. How should we think about the timing, just to drive some tangible monetization there?\nBrian Olsavsky: Well, I'll start. The -- on regionalization, I think it was such a significant change for us in the network. It's hard to really appreciate with a big change across so many dimensions it was that first to make such a change has all sorts of risk. And I think the team did a great job planning around it being very thorough. I think that we were able, with our placement algorithms, to get more regional local in-stock levels than we anticipated. And then I think until you actually put all the connections together, we changed a lot of the connections from a lot of these middle connections going from fulfillment centers to sortation centers and then to delivery stations to connecting the fulfillment centers and delivery stations more directly which, of course, is easier to do when you have more local in stock in a region. But I think that we were able -- the connections that we made and the optimization that we made there allowed us to get shorter transportation distances than we even anticipated in items to people a lot quicker. And then always one of the issues you got to worry about when you make a change that big is whether or not you end up splitting shipments and having more -- fewer items per box and per shipment. And that was also something that we really had to work through in the design and in the early stages and we've gotten a lot better on. So we're just across the board, we're seeing shorter transportation distances and much faster delivery to customers. And when you deliver faster delivery to customers, they actually start to consider you for a lot more items than they otherwise would. I think it's part of what -- if you look at our very significant growth rates right now in everyday essentials and consumables, a lot of it is when you -- if you're going to order something which you need in the same day or next day, you're not going to consider it if it's coming in 3 or 4 days. But when you're consistently getting it in same day or the next day, just changes what you're willing to do. I think the second question was on gen AI and the timing of monetization. What I would tell you is that we have been surprised at the pace of growth in generative AI. Our generative AI business is growing very, very quickly, as I mentioned earlier. And almost by any measure, it's a pretty significant business for us already. And yet I would also say that companies are still in the relatively early stages. I mean now you have to get perspective. My perspective is that the cloud is still in the early stages. If you think about 90% plus of the global IT spend being on-premises, where I think that equation is going to flip in 10 years. I think cloud is early. So if you -- with that lens on, I still think we're very early in generative AI. And what's interesting, too, around generative AI because we have so many companies who are doing all sorts of prototypes and it's really accelerating very rapidly on the training side with Trainium and Inferentia and then on the application building and running side with Bedrock, is that companies are still trying to sort out for themselves what they're going to run at large-scale production in all of these areas. Because what happens is you try a model, you test the model, you like the results of the model and then you plug it into your application. And what a lot of companies figure out quickly is that using the really large -- the large models and the large sizes ends up often being more expensive than what they anticipated and what they want to spend on that application. And sometimes too much latency in getting the answers as it shovels through the really large models. And so customers are experimenting with lots of different types of models and then different model sizes to get the cost and latency characteristics that they need for different use cases. And it's one of the things that I think is so useful about Bedrock is that customers are trying so many variants right now but to have a service that not only lets you leverage lots of third party as well as Amazon large language miles but also lots of different sizes and then makes the transition of moving those workloads easy between them is very advantageous.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question, I have two, one on AWS, one on the retail business. On AWS AI Andy, I recognize you have a pretty multipronged AI approach. But just could you talk us through sort of one or two of the early generative AI products where you're seeing the most early demand and interest? And as you talk to customers, are there still hurdles or pain points that you're not quite serving in your product suite you look to solve and innovate on over the next couple of years in AI? And then the second one, you made a lot of steps on the regionalization of warehouses and making it more efficient. Where are you on robotics in the warehouses? And how should we think about the potential impact of that to drive profitability even higher?\nAndrew Jassy: On the AI side, I think that if you're looking for some of the products that we're offering that are -- that have a lot of early resonance and traction, I would -- I'd start with Bedrock. These customers are -- they're very excited about Bedrock. And it's making it so much easier to get applications, generative AI applications built. And again, it's machine learning and AI has been something that people have been excited about for 25 years. In my opinion, about a half dozen years ago, it took a pretty significant leap forward where it was much easier given the economics and scalability of compute and storage and then some of the tools that we built like SageMaker, it was much easier for everyday developers to start to interact with AI. But it just -- it took another meaningful step forward with generative AI but still it's complicated to actually figure out which models you want to work, you want to use and how you actually want to employ them and trying to make sure you have the right results, trying to make sure you get safe results, trying to make sure you end up with a cost structure and a customer experience that you want. And so it's hard. And customers will like -- there's a certain number of customers who have very deep AI expert practitioners but most companies don't. And so Bedrock just takes so much of the difficulty out of those decisions and those variables that people are very excited about Bedrock. They're using it in a very broad way. They're extremely excited about not just the set of models in there but if you look at a leader like Anthropic and the ability for our customers in Bedrock to have exclusive early access to models and customization tools and fine-tuning which gives them more control, there's just -- there's a lot of buzz and a lot of usage and a lot of traction around Bedrock. I would also say our chips, Trainium and Inferentia, as most people know, there's a real shortage right now in the industry in chips. It's really hard to get the amount of GPUs that everybody wants. And so it's just another reason why Trainium and Inferentia are so attractive to people. They have better price performance characteristics than the other options out there but also the fact that you can get access to them. And we've done, I think, a pretty good job providing supply there and ordering meaningfully in advance as well. And so you're seeing very large LLM providers make big bets on those chips. I think Anthropic deciding to train their future LLM model on Trainium and using Inferentia as well is really a statement. And then you look at the really hot start-up Perplexity.ai, who also just made a decision to do all their training and inference on top of Trainium and Inferentia. So those are 2 examples. I'd say CodeWhisperer, too, is just, again, it's just a game changer if you can allow your engineers not to have to do the more repetitive work of cutting and pasting and building certain functions that really, if somebody knew your code base better, could do. And so it's a real -- it's a productivity game changer for developers. And then actually launching that customization vehicle so that they actually understand your own proprietary code base, that is something that customers are quite excited about. So those are ultimately early traction AI. There's so much more to provide, Brian. I mean there's -- I think people -- even though Bedrock is so much easier to use than people trying to build models themselves and build the applications, I think people are still looking to find ways to make it easier to look at a big corpus of data and run an agent on top of it or maybe they don't have to do all that work themselves. I think people are looking for automated ways to understand developer environments and be able to ask any question on the developer environment. So there's a lot more. It's going to be a long time before we run out of services. And yes, I think it's a good thing to look toward the next few months in re:Invent to see the additional things that team launches. I think on the robotics piece, it's a very significant investment for us. It has been for several years. It's made a huge difference for us. It's made a big difference for us both on the productivity side, on the cost side as well as importantly on the safety side where we can have our teammates working on things that are even safer than what they get to work on today. We have a very substantial investment of additional robotics initiatives, I would say many of which are coming to fruition in 2024 and 2025 that we think will make a further additional impact on the cost and productivity and safety and our fulfillment service.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Maybe one follow-up on AWS and one on the ads business. Andy, would love your perspective. The cloud optimization theme started in the second half of '22 when there were a lot of macro concerns. And then the AI theme really only sort of came to the forefront in the last 8 or 9 months. What's your perspective on how turning the calendar into 2024 and there being a new IT budget cycle could possibly lead us to put the optimization theme in the background and some of the AI theme come more to the forefront when there might be more distinct budgeting around AI as a theme? That would be number one. And then in your ads business, you're approaching $50 billion run rate and it's compounding in the mid-20s. What are you most excited about on the initiative front to continue to build scale both on Amazon properties and possibly off Amazon as a broader digital advertising player?\nAndrew Jassy: On the AWS side, my perspective, we'll obviously all have to wait and see to some extent. But my perspective is that in 2024, you're going to -- I think a lot of the relatively low-hanging fruit on optimization has happened in 2023. It's not to say there won't be any more optimization. It's just that there's more low-hanging fruit when you have very large footprints and you've built a lot of applications on a platform for you to go decide to optimize if that's what you want to go do. And so I think 2020 -- we're already seeing it now with the attenuation of optimization over the last several months. But I think you'll continue to see the attenuation continue and we're already seeing more and more companies that are turning their attention to newer initiatives. And I think what you will see in '24 and '25 as well, I think -- I don't think it's a 1-year deal, I think that's going to be a several-year trajectory, is that you're going to just see a lot of companies not just looking at the new generative AI workloads but also there was a significant number of new customer transformations where companies were going to largely move from being on-premises to being in the cloud. That got stalled in 2023 because companies were being more conservative with their spend and wary of an uncertain economy. And so I think that what you'll see increasingly is that companies will both go back to those transformations they were planning on making and working with a lot of systems integrator partners as well as ourselves as well as start to see the production in large scale of the generative AI applications that they're all working on and prototyping and starting to deploy into production. I think on the ad front, well, there's a lot I'm excited about on the ad side as well. I think that it's interesting what's happened in our ads business as if you look around the industry, most advertising-heavy companies have struggled growth-wise as the economy has been difficult. And while we see companies being more cautious on the ad side and the top-of-funnel products, things like display and a little bit of video, we're still seeing a lot of strength in the lower-funnel ad products like sponsored products. And I think in these types of economies, we have fared pretty well in part because we have a number of owned and operated properties that have very large volumes that advertisers and brands want to get in front of. Even in a harder economy, there's going to be a lot of e-commerce purchasing. So people want to be in front of our customers in our marketplace. Or take Thursday Night Football which is we're in our second season of Thursday Night Football and off to a great start, the ratings are 25% higher than they were a year ago through 6 weeks. But also, we're doing much better on the advertising side than we did in our first year and that's a property that's really valuable. It's the one game that week and advertisers want to be in front of customers because there's 13 million customers a week watching. So I think part of it is because we have owned and operated properties that have a lot of volume. And then I think the other piece is that most of our resource in the advertising side is spent on machine learning expert practitioners who are owning algorithms to make sure that the sponsor results people get when they search on something are relevant. And because of that, those ads perform better for advertisers. So when they have to think about budget decisions, they're going to choose the ones that have large volume and perform better. I think both of those are real advantages in our advertising area right now. In terms of additional things we're excited about. I think that we have barely scraped the surface with respect to figuring out how to intelligently integrate advertising into video, into audio and into grocery. So I think we're early days in that. I think that we also started externalizing some of our products like sponsored products to third-party websites. And you see that with what we've done with Pinterest, Hearst Newspapers and BuzzFeed, so I think there's -- again, we're still pretty early in that area but it's growing well and we're very focused on continuing to in a great customer experience.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. On those AWS deals Andy, that you talked about in the September quarter, was there something different about those deals, different industry, different verticals, different geographic markets? Or is it just kind of a resumption of kind of the deal flow that you've had in years past? So that's the first question. And secondly, Brian, international. Is international finally at a point where it can be sustainably profitable going forwards, maybe except for the seasonally challenged March quarter? Have you wrung out enough efficiencies and gotten enough scales? And the oldest markets there are big enough and scalable enough and profitable enough that it offsets the newer countries? Have you finally reached that point?\nBrian Olsavsky: First, just to give Andy a break. On international, thanks for your question. Yes, the quarter was just short of breakeven. And as you pointed out, that's a departure from kind of prior trends. I would answer that question this way. There's multiple things going on internationally. In our established countries, U.K., Germany, Japan, France, those countries are profitable and have been profitable. And we continue to work on price selection and convenience. And all that retail base is essentially adding sellers, adding vendors and selection, scaling advertising and improving the cost structure of our ops network. So many of the ops productivity initiatives, probably with the exception of regionalization, is more of a U.S. side right now. But we're working on all those productivity elements and speed concurrently globally. And you're seeing that internationally and customers are responding. On the emerging side, over the last 6 years, we've launched 10 new countries. History has shown us that those all take time to grow into profitability. The U.S. took 10 years -- excuse me, 9 years originally. And they're all on their own journey there with growth and scale and profitability and selection and a number of other variables. So that's -- those are all going well as well. We continue -- we're going to continue to invest internationally in things like Prime and expanding Prime benefits and we're going to continue to build out the fulfillment and transportation networks to better serve customers. So I can't say it's permanently we've reached a breakeven threshold for profitability. I think the trend lines are clear, though and we'll continue to work on accelerating that journey in all countries, especially the emerging ones.\nAndrew Jassy: On the AWS deals, it's a really broad mix of industries and geographies. So it's not comped up in one. Some are kind of first really big deals from customers. Some of them are very large expansions of existing agreements where they've gone from call it, 20% of their workloads to 50% of their workloads moving to AWS in the cloud. It's also -- I'm not even really including in that number, a number of really big public sector deals that we've done over the last chunk of time that won't hit for a period of time; and so all these deals don't hit in a month. They happen over a period of time as you help those customers safely transition and migrate their workloads to AWS. But it hasn't been any one piece. And I wish I could tell you we knew exactly why they're starting to happen in faster numbers. I do think, in general, historically, deal volume tends to be lumpy and it doesn't perfectly distribute over a calendar year. I do think though that we've seen this in '23, for sure, that the time to close deals lengthened. And I think it's all reflective of what most companies in the world have been thinking about the last year which is just in the face of uncertain economy, you're going to be more conservative. There are going to be more people involved. You're going to spend more time on how you can save on your existing cost instead of migrating new workloads or thinking about signing new deals. And so I think what you're just starting to see along with some of the optimization attenuation is that companies are starting to look forward again. And so we've just seen a collection of those the last couple of months that had been -- being discussed for several months where I think, frankly, both sides thought they would close faster but just went slower than they did. So I just think you're starting to see companies look forward more.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today for the call and for your questions.

Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Jassy: Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we are reporting $134.4 billion in revenue and $7.7 billion in operating income, both of which exceeded the top end of our guidance ranges. We're encouraged by the progress we're making on several key priorities, namely: lowering our cost to serve in our stores business; continuing to innovate on and improve our various customer experiences; and building new customer experiences that can meaningfully change what's possible for customers in our business long term. I'll start with our ongoing effort to lower our cost to serve in our stores' fulfillment network. Q2 saw another meaningful improvement in this area as we have steadily made progress for the last several quarters. Central to our efforts has been the decision to transition our stores' fulfillment and transportation network from one national network in the United States to a series of eight separate regions serving smaller geographic areas. We keep a broad selection of inventory in each region, making it faster and less expensive to get those products to customers. Regionalization is working and has delivered a 20% reduction in number of touches for our delivered package, a 19% reduction in miles traveled to deliver packages to customers and more than 1,000 basis point increase in deliveries fulfilled within region, which is now at 76%. This is a lot of progress. Sometimes I hear people make the argument that Amazon is chasing faster speed, while driving its costs higher and where it doesn't matter much to customers. This argument is incorrect.  There are two things to note. First, customers care a lot about faster delivery. We have a lot of data that shows when we make faster delivery promises on a detail page, customers purchase more often, not just a little higher, meaningfully higher. It's also true that when customers know they can get their items really quickly, it changes their consideration of using us for future purchases too. Second, when shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which cost less in transportation, gets there faster and is better for the environment. There's a lot of goodness in that equation. This ability to have shipments closer to customers is the result of a lot of work and invention on the regionalization side, placement logic and local in-stock algorithms. It's also driven by our development and expansion of same-day fulfillment facilities, which is our fastest fulfillment mechanism and one of our least expensive, too. Our same-day facilities are located in the largest metro areas around the U.S., so our top-moving 100,000 SKUs, but also cover millions of other SKUs from nearby fulfillment centers that inject selection into these same-day facilities and have a design that streamlines getting items from order to being ready for delivery in as little as 11 minutes. The experience has been so positive for customers in our business that we're planning to double the number of these facilities. We believe that we are far from the law of diminishing returns and improving speed for customers. While we're seeing strong early results from this regionalization effort, we still see several ways in which we can be more efficient in this structure and we believe will improve productivity further. We've also reevaluated virtually every part of our fulfillment network this past year and see additional structural changes we can make that provide future upside. We're excited about this cost to serve improvement, but also remain maniacally focused on making customers' lives easier and better every day and relentlessly inventing to make it so. This means constantly trying to improve experiences that we can deliver to customers short and long term. This customer experience work is at the heart of what we do every day across every one of our businesses. And I can spend an hour on this call detailing various examples across the teams. For today, I'll just focus a bit on our stores and AWS businesses. For stores, our priorities continue to be providing customers with great selection, low prices and convenience. And as we've discussed, we've been especially focused on providing even faster delivery speeds. Our speed of delivery has never been faster. In this last quarter, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime members' orders arrived at the same day or next day. So far this year, we've delivered more than 1.8 billion units to U.S. Prime members the same or next day, nearly 4x what we delivered at those speeds by this point in 2019. Lowering our cost to serve allows us not only to invest in these speed improvements, but also add more selection at lower price points. In particular, we're growing our selection in everyday essentials, enabling customers to avoid going out to get these items and both increasing our basket sizes and the frequency with which customers choose to shop with us. We now have more than 300 million items available with U.S. Prime free shipping, including tens of millions of items with free same-day and 1-day delivery. We're continuing to focus on providing great value with tens of millions of deals that help customers stretch their dollar a little more. For instance, in Q2 of '23, we offered customers 144% more deals and coupons than we did in Q2 of 2022. Prime Day was similar. Amazon offered more deals than any past Prime Day event with a wide selection across millions of products. Prime members purchased more than 375 million items worldwide and saved more than $2.5 billion across the Amazon store, helping make it the biggest Prime Day ever. Next, a few words about AWS. AWS remains the clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position with respect to number of customers, size of partner ecosystem, breadth of functionality and the strongest operational performance. These are important factors for why AWS has grown the way it has over the last several years and for why AWS has almost doubled the revenue of any other provider. I've talked to many AWS customers over the years and continue to do so. And while all these factors I mentioned have been big drivers of the business' success, AWS customers tell us that as importantly, they care about the very different customer focus and orientation in AWS may see elsewhere. As the economy has been uncertain over the last year, AWS customers have needed assistance cost optimizing to withstand this challenging time and reallocate spend to newer initiatives that better drive growth. We've proactively helped customers do this. And while customers have continued to optimize during the second quarter, we've started seeing more customers shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. As a result, we've seen AWS' revenue growth rate stabilize during Q2 where we reported 12% year-over-year growth. The AWS team continues to innovate and change what's possible for customers at a rapid clip. You can see across the array of AWS product categories where AWS leads in compute, networking, storage, database, data solutions and machine learning, among other areas, and the continued invention and delivery in these areas is pretty unusual. For instance, a few years ago, we heard consistently from customers that they wanted to find more price performance ways to do generalized compute. And to enable that, we realized that we needed to rethink things all the way down to the silicon and set out to design our own general purpose CPU chips. Today, more than 50,000 customers use AWS' Graviton chips and AWS Compute instances, including 98 of our top 100 Amazon EC2 customers, and these chips have about 40% better price performance than other leading x86 processors. The same sort of reimagining is happening in generative AI right now. Generative AI has captured people's imagination, but most people are talking about the application layer, specifically what OpenAI has done with ChatGPT. It's important to remember that we're in the very early days of the adoption and success of generative AI, and that consumer applications is only one layer of the opportunity. We think of large language models in generative AI as having 3 key layers, all of which are very large in our opinion and all of which AWS is investing heavily in. At the lowest layer is the compute required to train foundational models and do inference or make predictions. Customers are excited by Amazon EC2 P5 instances powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs to train large models and develop generative AI applications. However, to date, there's only been one viable option in the market for everybody and supply has been scarce. That, along with the chip expertise we've built over the last several years, prompted us to start working several years ago on our own custom AI chips for training called Trainium and inference called Inferentia that are on their second versions already and are a very appealing price performance option for customers building and running large language models. We're optimistic that a lot of large language model training and inference will be run on AWS' Trainium and Inferentia chips in the future. We think of the middle layer as being large language models as a service. Stepping back for a second, to develop these large language models, it takes billions of dollars and multiple years to develop. Most companies tell us that they don't want to consume that resource building themselves. Rather, they want access to those large language models, want to customize them with their own data without leaking their proprietary data into the general model, have all the security, privacy and platform features in AWS work with this new enhanced model and then have it all wrapped in a managed service. This is what our service Bedrock does and offers customers all of these aforementioned capabilities with not just one large language model but with access to models from multiple leading large language model companies like Anthropic, Stability AI, AI21 Labs, Cohere and Amazon's own developed large language models called Titan. Customers, including Bridgewater Associates, Coda, Lonely Planet, Omnicom, 3M, Ryanair, Showpad and Travelers are using Amazon Bedrock to create generative AI application. And we just recently announced new capabilities from Bedrock, including new models from Cohere, Anthropic's Claude 2 and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 as well as agents for Amazon Bedrock that allow customers to create conversational agents to deliver personalized up-to-date answers based on their proprietary data and to execute actions. If you think about these first 2 layers I've talked about, what we're doing is democratizing access to generative AI, lowering the cost of training and running models, enabling access to large language model of choice instead of there only being one option, making it simpler for companies of all sizes and technical acumen to customize their own large language model and build generative AI applications in a secure and enterprise-grade fashion, these are all part of making generative AI accessible to everybody and very much what AWS has been doing for technology infrastructure over the last 17 years. Then that top layer is where a lot of the publicity and attention have focused, and these are the actual applications that run on top of these large language models. As I mentioned, ChatGPT is an example. We believe one of the early compelling generative AI applications is a coding companion. It's why we built Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI-powered coding companion, which recommends code snippets directly in the code editor, accelerating developer productivity as they code. It's off to a very strong start and changes the game with respect to developer productivity. Inside Amazon, every one of our teams is working on building generative AI applications that reinvent and enhance their customers' experience. But while we will build a number of these applications ourselves, most will be built by other companies, and we're optimistic that the largest number of these will be built on AWS. Remember, the core of AI is data. People want to bring generative AI models to the data, not the other way around. AWS not only has the broadest array of storage, database, analytics and data management services for customers, it also has more customers and data store than anybody else. Coupled with providing customers with unmatched choices at these 3 layers of the generative AI stack as well as Bedrock's enterprise-grade security that's required for enterprises to feel comfortable putting generative AI applications into production, we think AWS is poised to be customers' long-term partner of choice in generative AI. We're also continuing to make meaningful progress in building new customer experiences that can meaningfully change what's possible for customers in our business long term. Amazon Business is one of our fastest-growing offerings with a $35 billion annual gross sales run rate. And the team is working hard to further build out the selection, value, convenience and features that business customers need. Buy with Prime is continuing to show a lot of progress. Merchants in early trials who use Buy with Prime saw their shopper conversion increased by 25% on average, which makes a real difference to their business. Also, merchants who participate in Prime Day activities, in aggregate, experienced a 10x increase in daily Buy with Prime orders during the sales event period versus the month before we announced Prime Day. It's frankly only been a short amount of time that we've decided to invest significantly in the health care market segment. A lot of what we tried before were smaller experiments. But we're pleased with Amazon Pharmacy doubling its active customers in the past year, and we're pleased with the response to RxPass, which enables Prime members to receive all of their eligible generic medications for just $5 a month and have them delivered free to their door. One Medical has been part of Amazon for just a few months now and we're encouraged by what we're seeing there, too. Our grocery business continues to grow. We already have a very large business in nontemperature-controlled areas like consumables, pet food, beauty and canned goods that continues to grow as we keep increasing speed and lowering our cost to serve, which allows us to sell more items more cost effectively. Whole Foods continues to lead the organic grocery space, is growing at a healthy clip and has meaningfully improved its profitability in the last year. We're pleased with what we're seeing with Whole Foods. And as I've shared before, we're working on new formats in our mass physical store offering, Amazon Fresh, having significantly improved the number of the key business inputs and just rolled out new concepts in stores. We also see substantial innovation and progress in other areas like Kuiper, Zoox and Alexa. We're still relatively early in many of our investments with technology inventions that are changing what's possible to deliver for customers in these areas, but they're big long-term opportunities that we remain optimistic about. Finally, I want to recognize our teams on being named 1 in LinkedIn's Top Companies to Grow your Career in the United States. It's a testament to our work to be a great employer with leading compensation benefits and upskilling opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you, Andy. As Andy mentioned, we saw worldwide revenue of $134.4 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year and above the top end of our guidance range. We are encouraged by the strength in our reported revenue, which is another proof point that our focus on price, selection and convenience continues to resonate with customers. We continue to see healthy demand across everyday essentials and in categories like beauty and health and personal care and have seen a positive customer response to improvements in personalization and enhancements to our website and mobile app. During the quarter, we also saw improvements in macroeconomic indicators across our North America and international segments, but continue to see customers trading down and seeking value in their purchases. Delivery speed has been a key area of focus over the last several quarters, and we reached record levels during Q2. Prime members love the faster ship speeds and are shopping more often. Advertising revenue remained strong, up 22% year-over-year. Our performance-based advertising offerings continue to be the largest contributor to our growth. Our teams worked to increase the relevancy of the ads we show to our customers by leveraging machine learning and improve our ability to measure the return on advertising spend for brands. Third-party unit mix increased to 60% during the quarter, the highest level we've ever seen, and we're continuing to see good growth in the number of sellers and the unit sold per seller. We're making steady progress on improving our worldwide stores profitability. Since North America segment operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have seen 5 consecutive quarters of improvement, with second quarter operating margin of 3.9%. This is an improvement of 620 basis points over these past 5 quarters. One of the largest drivers of this operating income improvement in the stores business has been reducing our cost to serve, with shipping costs and fulfillment costs continuing to grow at a slower pace than our unit growth. Most recently, regionalization is an important contributor. Faster delivery speed from better network connectivity and better inventory placement means less miles traveled and fewer touches, resulting in less cost. And while we are pleased with the progress we have made, we see more opportunity to drive improved cost efficiencies going forward. Moving to the international segment. Since our operating margin loss bottomed out in Q3 of last year, we have seen 3 consecutive quarters of improvement, with a second quarter margin loss of negative 3%. This is an improvement of 590 basis points over the last 3 quarters. This segment also includes our emerging countries. It is important to remember how early we are in some of these marketplaces. We've launched more than 10 countries in the past 6 years and are always evaluating our customer experience as well as our path to profitability, and we like the path we're on. As a reminder, it took us 9 years to reach profitability in the United States. In addition, across our North America and international results, inflation headwinds also continue to ease, most notably in fuel prices, linehaul rates, ocean and rail rates. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth was 12%, with growth rates stabilizing during Q2. We are encouraged by the strength of our customer pipeline and believe having a large diverse customer base that is mostly cost optimized sets us up well for future growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was positive and improved for the fourth sequential quarter. Our financial focus remains on driving long-term sustainable free cash flows. The largest driver of the recent improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, most notably in the North America and international segments where, as I said, we've made meaningful improvement in our fulfillment network productivity and operating leverage and benefited from moderating inflationary pressures. We've also seen improvements in our working capital contributions to free cash flow. Over the past couple of years, working capital hasn't been as efficient as we've held higher weeks of cover of inventory in the face of supply chain disruptions. Most recently, as these disruptions continue to ease, we are improving our inventory efficiency, resulting in improvements in our working capital. We will remain focused on continued free cash flow improvement moving forward. Next, let's turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of capital expenditures plus equipment finance leases. These investments were $54 billion for the trailing 12-month period ended June 30, down from $61 billion in the comparable prior year period. Looking ahead to the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be slightly more than $50 billion compared to $59 billion in 2022. We expect fulfillment and transportation CapEx to be down year-over-year, partially offset by increased infrastructure CapEx to support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments related to generative AI and large language model efforts.  With that, let's move on to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird.\nColin Sebastian: I guess first on the fulfillment efficiency. Would be curious if you could give us a sense for how much of that optimization in the network with unit economics may have already been achieved in these numbers versus how much more you think is left to go. And related to that, I'm curious if you can leverage this reformulated network to help out with the grocery expansion. Or will that be limited to the stores and the specialized automated facilities you're building out?\nBrian Olsavsky: I'll take that first one. So on fulfillment efficiency, we're encouraged again by what we're seeing with regionalization and also the efforts to control our cost structure and the -- some of the inflationary pressures coming down. We're still in that journey, though, to reclaim the cost structure that we had previously and we consider this as a point along the road. So encouraged by some of the margin improvements we're seeing, particularly over the last 3 to 5 quarters but we're still underway. There's still a lot to be regained in our fulfillment area, and the teams are working very hard on it. On the question of grocery, as Andy explained at different points, our grocery business has a lot of dimensions to it. Obviously, there's consumables, there's fresh goods, there's Whole Foods. The same -- sub-same-day is probably mostly impacting the first -- that pocket of the consumables and everyday essentials. And as Andy mentioned, we're able to expand our selection in those areas because our cost structure can, quite frankly, afford it when the distances of customers are shorter and the transportation costs are more fixed.\nAndrew Jassy: I'll just add to that, this is Andy, that I do think there's some optimization and some leverage we get from our fulfillment network. And particularly in the case of being able to inject a number of items into our same-day facilities, to increase the number of items that people can add at the last minute, even grocery items that they can get same day. And I think that you see some of that already and you'll see more of that moving forward. And I also think that you'll see over time that we're going to be able to leverage being able to have -- people be able to pick up different items from different grocery-like options that are different grocery formats. But it's also true that we have infrastructure build-out in our grocery business that's different and optimized for the grocery business, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: I'll limit myself to one question for each of you. Amazon Business has been a couple of years since you've talked about that. It would seem like there'd be a lot more opportunities, frankly, a lot higher level of sales, bookings, whatever, that you get out of that. So Andy, just talk about like how big of a priority is that for you? And what's the growth strategy? Like how do you take that to $100 billion? And then on the -- Brian, on AWS, in the last 2 quarters, you provided a little bit of a look ahead into the quarter in terms of the AWS growth, given some of the commentary about moving beyond optimization and into new workloads without -- if you don't give a specific number, at least talk about the trends that you're seeing versus what you had in the second quarter.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. Thanks, Mark. Let me start with that second question. So again, if we rewind to our last conference call, we had seen 16% AWS revenue growth in Q1, and the growth rates have been dropping during the quarter. And what I mentioned was that April was running about 500 basis points lower than Q1. What we've seen in the quarter is stabilization and you see the final 12% growth. I will stop for a moment and just put that in perspective. So again, last Q2 last year, we had close to $20 billion of revenue and we grew that $2.4 billion. So that's -- while that is 12%, there's a lot of cost optimization dollars that came out and a lot of new workloads and new customers that went in. So there was -- on our base, it's very large numbers. And when customers start to -- that cost optimization work, they can take some of their spend down for a while as they do that, and we help them do that and been part of our DNA ever since we started AWS. So that's all good. What we're seeing in the quarter is that those cost optimizations, while still going on, are moderating and many maybe behind us in some of our large customers. And now we're seeing more progression into new workloads, new business. So those balanced out in Q2. We're not going to give segment guidance for Q3. But what I would add is that we saw Q2 trends continue into July. So generally feel the business has stabilized, and we're looking forward to the back end of the year in the future because, as Andy said, there's a lot of new functionality coming out with -- and there's a lot of spend that will be in this area for all the great solutions that are out there for generative AI and large language models as well as machine learning solutions that we've always had for customers. So optimistic and starting to see some good traction with our customers' new volumes.\nAndrew Jassy: Yes. I'll just underline one point Brian made and then quickly get to the Amazon Business point. Just if you think about the AWS business being an $88 billion revenue run rate business, to grow double digits on a business that size with the amount of cost optimizing that's been happening, to grow double digits, you have to be adding a lot of new customers and a lot of new workloads just to grow double digits. So when I talked about last quarter how I liked a lot of the fundamentals that we were seeing in the business with respect to customer pipeline, the new workloads, the migrations happening, what the team is rolling out functionality-wise, that's kind of what I'm talking about. And as we start to see cost optimization attenuate and more of the workloads, new workloads that people took those cost optimizations and actually started to plan come to fruition, not to mention what's coming with generative AI, there's a lot of growth in front of us on AWS. Just on your Amazon Business question, Mark, $35 billion annual run rate for gross sales is pretty strong growth. And if you look at it year-over-year, it continues to be very strong. But I like the way you're thinking, Mark, and it's almost like you're in some of the meetings that we're in where I asked the very same question. The team is working hard to build $100 billion-plus business over time. And I think that the business has grown to be pretty large already, and I still think we only have a fraction of the features that we need to address more of the enterprise at this point. There's all sorts of companies ordering obviously from Amazon Business. But the bigger procurement workloads, there are certain features that you need to make them much easier in the way that companies are used to buying in those big procurements. And so we have a lot of features that we're adding. We have a number of service pieces that we need to add really around helping on big buys, do some of the service substantiations. And so we have a lot of functionality that we're very quickly adding to the mix here. But I don't think we're close to being done growing there, and that is a very strong area of focus for our stores team and for our senior leadership team as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Andy, just on AI monetization. Can you just talk to when you think you'll start to see that flow into the AWS business? Is that 2024? Do you feel like the back half, you'll start to see that as a bigger impact for the business?\nAndrew Jassy: Yes. Good question, Brent. What I would say is that we have had a very significant amount of business in AWS driven by machine learning and AI for several years. And you've seen that largely in the form of compute as customers have been doing a lot of machine learning training and then running their models and production on top of AWS and our compute instances. But you've also seen it in the form of the 20-plus machine learning services that we've had out there for a few years. I think when you're talking about the big potential explosion in generative AI, which everybody is excited about, including us, I think we're in the very early stages there. We're a few steps into a marathon in my opinion. I think it's going to be transformative, and I think it's going to transform virtually every customer experience that we know. But I think it's really early. I think most companies are still figuring out how they want to approach it. They're figuring how to train models. They want to -- they don't want to build their own very large language models. They want to take other models and customize it, and services like Bedrock enable them to do so. But it's very early. And so I expect that will be very large, but it will be in the future.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for all the detail in the prepared remarks around framing some of those key issues. Andy, maybe coming back to grocery. There's been a lot of coverage in the press around your grocery initiative in the last couple of days. When you take a step back, how much do you think about solving the grocery dynamic in the business to capitalize on it the way you want? Is it an element of things you need to build and the application of capital versus elements of executing on what's already in place and sort of aligning the assets in place against the scale of the Amazon Prime household in your customer base?\nAndrew Jassy: Yes, it's a good question. It's a little bit of both. I mean if I just step back and think about how we think about grocery, we continue to have this very big business in nonperishables, which is where a lot of the mass merchandisers started in grocery several years ago. So these are areas like consumables and canned goods and pet food and beauty and health. And as I said, it's a big business that's continuing to grow. But if you want to be able to serve more customers, which we do, and there are a whole number of reasons for that and customers want it, you have to have a strong physical presence. We started with Whole Foods, which is the pioneer in organic grocery, it continues to be, and we really like the way Whole Foods is growing. We've made a number of really important adjustments in the business, has changed its profitability trajectory over the last year. And we really like where that's headed and we're expanding that meaningfully. But if you want to be really broad, you have to have a mass physical format. We have been working on that for several years with Amazon Fresh. And I would say that we weren't pleased with the inputs, the progress on the inputs there. And the team has worked very hard over the last year to first start on the quality of the input, and that goes towards the quality of what we already had in place. And these are things like the right in-stock levels, the right cost structure, the right figures on things like obsolescence, just a number of the core inputs there, we just felt like we could be sharper and better. And I think that team has made up a lot of improvements. We have spent a lot of time thinking and rethinking how we want the formats to look. And we've just started rolling out some of those new formats, starting in our Chicago stores and then moving to our Southern California stores shortly thereafter. And you see added selection. You see added private brands. You see added well-known third-party brands like Krispy Kreme in coffee in the stores. You've seen a refined decor in the stores. You see refined dash cards that keep a running tally for people so they understand where they are at the moment wherever they're shopping, as well as refined self-service checkouts. And all those things, to me, are part of an effort we're trying to pursue to have a format in our mass Amazon Fresh stores that resonate more with customers. And we're hopeful that we will find that format and that it gives us the type of results that give us confidence to want to expand more broadly. But we won't expand unless we see that type of resonance. We're not just going to be on discipline. We're going to be thoughtful and disciplined about it. I do think also, you're starting to see across the team pulling some of the efforts together. So we have a number of different grocery offerings that I just talked about, just having a converged shopping cart for customers, which they have obviously wanted that I think will help them quite a bit. We're continuing to extend delivery to non-Prime customers as well. And so I think there are a number of opportunities for us over time to grow the business. We're optimistic that we'll be able to do so, but we're also being disciplined about not expanding the physical fresh stores until we have a format that we think is more resonant with customers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. The first one, Andy, on the last call last quarter, you talked about how you sort of talked about North America retail margins potentially getting to at or above pre-COVID levels. I think you said a margin around 4% and you're sort of talking now about investing more in grocery and expanding same-day and expanding that footprint. How should we think about sort of the forward slope of North America retail margins and sort of invest in some of these new initiatives in the retail business? Then the second one on AI. How high of an investment priority is it for you to improve your own retail and device network through more AI investments, potentially through logistics or AI-based agents, et cetera? How large is that in the overall investment priority list?\nAndrew Jassy: Well, I'll start on the North America retail piece, which is again, I'll just remind that we're not going to expand the number of fresh stores in a very significant way until we believe we have something that is resonant with customers and that we're going to like the return on invested capital. So that to me, I'm hopeful we're going to find that but we won't until we do. I think as it relates to same-day facilities, we actually think that's going to be very positive for the business. It is -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, it is one of our most cost-effective mechanisms and fulfillment vehicles with respect not just to getting it there to customers quickly, but being fast, in part because those facilities, they're smaller facilities. They're big enough obviously to hold, in steady state, 100,000 SKUs and then also to have all of our nearby fulfillment centers be able to inject lots of different selection in there, so we can cover several million SKUs in that same-day or 1-day fashion. But they're smaller -- in general, they're smaller facilities with less conveyance and with more streamlined pick directly to pack and to get out to the dock to ship. And so they're just much more efficient as well. So we actually think that the expansion of those is going to not just help with speed and with demand, but we're going to also like the cost structure associated with that. And I continue to believe what I said last quarter, Brian, which is I do believe that we'll get back to margins like what we had pre COVID. And I don't think that's the end of what's possible for us there. On the AI question, what I would tell you, every single one of our businesses inside of Amazon, every single one has multiple generative AI initiatives going right now. And they range from things that help us be more cost effective and streamlined in how we run operations in various businesses to the absolute heart of every customer experience in which we offer. And so it's true in our stores business. It's true in our AWS business. It's true in our advertising business. It's true in all our devices, and you can just imagine what we're working on with respect to Alexa there. It's true in our entertainment businesses, every single one. It is going to be at the heart of what we do. It's a significant investment and focus for us.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: Just on AWS, as you lap optimizations and the macro-driven slowdown and you start to get the new workload deployment, how do you think about what normalized growth could look like for AWS in a better macro environment? And then secondly, helpful to get the just over $50 billion CapEx number for this year. Just curious how generative AI changes or could change your CapEx trajectory going forward.\nAndrew Jassy: Well, it's a good question. And I would say that while I expect there will continue to be cost optimization, I think that the balance of cost optimizations to actually new workloads and new migrations as we saw a shift in that in Q2, I expect that we'll continue to see that shift over time. And as I said, I mean, everybody has to make their own conclusions on what percentage revenue growth they believe it means. But to grow double digits on an $88 billion revenue run rate business, when you're seeing that amount of cost optimization as every company in the world is trying to save as much money as they can in the last year, to still grow double digits on a base that size means that we're acquiring a lot of new customers and a lot of new workloads. And so I'm very bullish on the growth of AWS over the next several years. And any one quarter, it's hard for me to predict, but I am bullish about it in the medium to long term for sure. I think that on the -- how much generative AI may impact the capital expense spend, included in that number is a pretty significant amount of capital expense in the AWS business for large language models and for generative AI. And we have quite a bit of demand right now. And so it's -- like in AWS, in general, one of the interesting things in AWS, and this has been true from the very earliest days, which is the more demand that you have, the more capital you need to spend because you invest in data centers and hardware upfront and then you monetize that over a long period of time. So I would like to have the challenge of having to spend a lot more in capital in generative AI because it will mean that customers are having success and they're having success on top of our services and -- but I think that, that's our best estimate right now on that capital expense, and we'll update it if we find it's different.\nDave Fildes: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2023 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, April 27, 2023, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining today\u2019s call. As Dave mentioned earlier, I\u2019m joined today by Andy Jassy, our CEO. Before we move on to take your questions, I\u2019ll make some comments regarding our Q1 results. Let\u2019s begin with revenue. For the first quarter, our worldwide net sales were $127.4 billion, up 9% year-over-year, or 11% excluding approximately 210 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. This was above the top end of our guidance range. Overall, we are pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing in worldwide stores businesses, including quarter-over-quarter revenue acceleration in the International segment, which is helped by easing macroeconomic pressures in Europe. Across the geographies we serve, customers appreciate our focus on staying sharp on pricing, having strong selection and easier convenience, including delivery speeds, which continued to improve throughout the first quarter. That said, the uncertain economic environment and ongoing inflationary pressures continue to be a factor, and we believe it\u2019s continuing to drive cautious spending across consumers. This means our customers are looking to stretch their budgets further and are focused on value. We saw moderated spending on discretionary categories as well as shifts to lower-priced items and healthy demand in everyday essentials, such as consumables and beauty. Third-party sellers, including businesses who elect to utilize Fulfillment by Amazon for their storage and shipping services are a key contributor to the selection offered to customers. We also continued to invest meaningfully in brand protection efforts, including industry-leading technology, so that sellers can trust we will provide a great selling experience free from bad actors. Sellers comprised 59% of overall unit sales in Q1, up from 55% one year ago. We also saw strong engagement in our advertising services with revenue up 23% year-over-year, excluding the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. In particular, our sponsored product and brand offerings remain a key driver of growth as we work with advertisers to help customers make more informed purchase decisions. Our teams remain focused on delivering performance through our comprehensive and flexible measurement capabilities along with insights that allow advertisers the ability to measure the return on their advertising spend and help them grow their business. In AWS, net sales were $21.4 billion in the first quarter, up 16% year-over-year and representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Given the ongoing economic uncertainty, customers of all sizes in all industries continue to look for cost savings across their businesses, similar to what you\u2019ve seen us doing at Amazon. As expected, customers continue to evaluate ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to these tough economic conditions in the first quarter. And we are seeing these optimizations continue into the second quarter with April revenue growth rates about 500 basis points lower than what we saw in Q1. As a reminder, we\u2019re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We\u2019re working to build customer relationships and a business that will outlast all of us. Therefore, our AWS sales and support teams continue to spend much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so that they can better weather this uncertain economy. This customer orientation is built into our DNA and how we think about our customer relationships and business over the long term. Now, let\u2019s shift to worldwide operating income. For the first quarter, we reported $4.8 billion in operating income, above the top end of our guidance range. This operating income was negatively impacted by an estimated employee severance charge of approximately $470 million in Q1, including $270 million related to AWS. As we finalized our annual planning process and considered the ongoing economic environment, we made the difficult decision to eliminate 9,000 roles, impacting our AWS business as well as Twitch, devices, advertising and our human resources teams. In Q1, our year-over-year growth in stores revenue and unit sales outpaced growth in both our fulfillment expense and our outbound shipping costs. Inflationary pressures continued to ease quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by reductions in linehaul shipping rates as well as lower diesel fuel and electricity costs. We also built on the progress we made throughout 2022 in improving productivity in our fulfillment network through continued process and tech improvements. We exited Q4 with a good balance of labor throughout the network and leveraged that throughout Q1 with customer demand patterns remaining more stable compared to Q1 of last year. As labor availability has stabilized and inventory supply chain challenges have moderated, we\u2019re able to implement some significant structural changes to transition our U.S. fulfillment network to a regionalized model. We believe these improvements put us in a good position to improve both delivery speed and our cost to serve customers over time. We reported overall net income of $3.2 billion in the first quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I\u2019d point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation loss of $467 million included in non-operating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we\u2019ve noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon\u2019s ongoing operations but rather to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian\u2019s stock price. Turning to cash flows. We remain focused on building long-term sustainable growth in free cash flow, including our efforts towards a strong cash flow accretive working capital cycle. Our operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st increased to $54.3 billion, up 38% versus the comparable period year-over-year. Besides the cash benefit of improved profitability year-over-year, we\u2019ve also seen supply chains easing up and made progress to improve our inventory purchasing and payment cycles, which in turn has a positive impact on working capital. Now, let\u2019s turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be lower than our $59 billion investment level in 2022, primarily driven by an expected year-over-year decrease in fulfillment network investments. We\u2019re continuing to invest in infrastructure to support AWS customer needs, including investments to support Large Language Models and generative AI. Before we open the call up for your questions, I\u2019ll hand it over to Andy to share some high-level perspectives on the first quarter.\nAndy Jassy: Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll share a few thoughts before opening up for questions. From my perspective, I think there\u2019s a fair bit to like about how our teams are delivering for customers and the results we\u2019re starting to see. In our storage business, we\u2019ve been very focused on reducing our cost to serve in our fulfillment network. As we shared in the past, given the unexpected surge in demand during the pandemic, we doubled the size of our fulfillment center footprint and largely built the transportation network the size of UPS in a couple of years. This ended up substantially changing the number of nodes and connections in our fulfillment network. And as a result, we spent the last several months not only redesigning dozens of processes to drive better productivity but also re-architecting our placement approach and larger fulfillment center footprint to move from a national fulfillment network in the U.S. to a regional one. It means we\u2019ve created 8 interconnected regions in geographic areas with each of these regions having broad relevant selection to operate in a largely self-sufficient way while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. We just recently completed this rollout and are quite bullish on the early results. Not surprisingly, shorter travel distances means lower cost to serve and customers getting their orders faster. And while on the topic of delivery speed, we\u2019re really excited about our progress in providing customers more one-day and same-day deliveries and are on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023. On the advertising side, we\u2019re continuing to buck wider advertising trends and deliver robust growth. I think there are a few reasons for it. First, even in difficult economies, most people still shop. And with the largest e-commerce shopping venue, we have a lot of customers that companies seek to reach. That, coupled with our very substantial investment in machine learning to make sure customers see relevant ads when they\u2019re looking for various items, have meant that these advertisements have performed unusually well for brands, which makes them want to advertise on Amazon. It\u2019s also worth noting that we\u2019re still very early in our efforts to find a way to thoughtfully place ads in our broader video, live sports, audio and grocery properties. We have a lot of upside still in advertising. In AWS, what we\u2019re seeing is enterprises continuing to be cautious in their spending in this uncertain time. Customers are looking for ways to save money however they can right now. They tell us that most of it is cost optimizing versus cost cutting, which is an interesting distinction because they say they\u2019re cost optimizing to reallocate those resources on new customer experiences. One of the great attributes of the cloud is that you can scale seamlessly up or down as demand dictates, which is not the case with on-premise\u2019 infrastructure. Customers want help finding ways to spend less during this challenging time. And given that it\u2019s best for customers long term, we\u2019ve been actively helping customers make these adjustments. We\u2019ve spent a fair bit of time analyzing what we\u2019re seeing, and I\u2019ve spent a good chunk of time myself looking as well, and we like the fundamentals of what we\u2019re seeing in AWS. The new customer pipeline looks strong. The set of ongoing migrations of workloads to AWS is strong. The product innovation and delivery is rapid and compelling. And people sometimes forget that 90-plus percent of global IT spend is still on-premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it\u2019s going to move to the cloud. And having the cloud infrastructure offering with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, the best securing operational performance and the largest partner ecosystem bodes well for us moving forward. But we\u2019re not close to being done inventing in AWS. Our recent announcement on Large Language Models and generative AI and the chips and managed services associated with them is another recent example. And in my opinion, few folks appreciate how much new cloud business will happen over the next several years from the pending deluge of machine learning that\u2019s coming. This past year has seen us do a fair bit of cost streamlining. As I mentioned in my recent shareholder letter, we took a deep look across the Company and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative\u2019s long-term potential to drive enough revenue, operating income, free cash flow and return on invested capital. In some cases, it led us to shuttering certain businesses like our physical bookstores, Forestar Stores, Amazon Fabric, Amazon Care and certain devices where we didn\u2019t see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs that weren\u2019t producing the returns we\u2019d hoped, an example of free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35 and changed them. We also made the very difficult decision to eliminate about 27,000 corporate roles. Like most leadership teams, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate what we\u2019re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively. But while we\u2019ve taken several actions to streamline our costs, we\u2019ve been able to do so while still pursuing the key strategic long-term investments that we believe can meaningfully make customers\u2019 lives better and potentially change what Amazon is. These are investments both in our larger business as mentioned earlier as well as in areas like international expansion in our stores business, large retail market segments in which we\u2019re still nascent like grocery and business-to-business, allowing consumers to use Prime off of Amazon in our Buy with Prime program, entertainment, devices, health care and our Low Earth Orbit satellite for the hundreds of millions of households, companies and government entities that have limited to no connectivity. It\u2019s hard to predict that all of these will be successful but only one or two working would change our business over the long term. We have a lot of work in front of us, but I like the direction we\u2019re headed and strongly believe our best days are in front of us. And with that, I\u2019ll open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Andy, you talked about the continued optimization. Just curious, can you talk about the degree to which optimization has been done in AWS versus what you think could still lie ahead, and when do you start to lap some of those efforts? And then also on the CapEx side, I think you said overall CapEx would be down in \u201823. Can you just help us understand that a little bit better between retail and AWS? And then what\u2019s required on CapEx from a generative AI and large language model perspective? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: This is Brian. I\u2019ll take the first -- the second part of that question first. On CapEx, we spent $59 million -- $59 billion, excuse me, last year. And we -- on our core fulfillment and transportation areas, we actually are spending less year-over-year, and those estimates are going down. The GAAP or the increases in AWS and infrastructure and we are adding more dollars to the -- for Large Language Models and generative AI. So, we\u2019re creating some space in our fulfillment and transportation number that has been repurposed over to AWS. We still think the combined CapEx will be lower year-over-year.\nAndy Jassy: Just on your first question, Doug. It\u2019s hard to say exactly where we are in the process. I think that what we continue to see when we talk with customers is that they\u2019re appropriately cautious about what they\u2019re seeing in the economy. They\u2019re trying to find ways to save money as most companies are, including our own. And we have a long track-record, which we continue to pursue, which I think makes sense for customers and for our business long term that we\u2019re not trying to optimize for a quarter or for a year. We\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to help customers be successful over a long period of time because we\u2019re trying to build relationships in a business that outlast to all of us. And so, we\u2019re spending a lot of time with customers trying to help them think of smart ways, not short-term ways, but smart ways to optimize their costs and to be able to scale up and down. And again, one of the big advantages of the cloud is that if you grow quickly, you can seamlessly scale up. But when you don\u2019t have the demand, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it, and that is not true with what you see on-premises. And so we\u2019re trying to work hard to help customers with that. I think it\u2019s important to remember that customers are pretty explicitly telling us that this is not a cost cutting effort where we intend on spending less money on technology or on the cloud. This is our reprioritizing what matters most to our business at this time and trying to reallocate resource so we can build new customer experience [and change what\u2019s possible] (ph). And so, I think if you think about -- those projects, by the way, take time to build. When you\u2019re reallocating, you\u2019re reprioritizing, you\u2019re redefining what you\u2019re going to build, you got to actually go build it before you can implement it. And we\u2019re working pretty carefully and closely with customers on those initiatives. I think it\u2019s important to remember that there\u2019s still so much growth ahead of the cloud, 90-plus percent of the global IT spend is on-premises. And so if you believe that equation is going to flip, it\u2019s mostly moving to the cloud. And I also think that there are a lot of folks that don\u2019t realize the amount of non-consumption right now that\u2019s going to happen and be spent in the cloud with the advent of Large Language Models and generative AI. I think so many customer experiences are going to be reinvented and invented that haven\u2019t existed before. And that\u2019s all going to be spent in my opinion, on the cloud.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Andy, you\u2019ve talked a lot in the letter -- the shareholder letter and on the last earnings call about driving greater levels of efficiencies in the Company and also possibly returning to some of the margin structures we saw pre-pandemic and absorbing overcapacity that built up during the pandemic. Can you give us an update on where you think you are in those broad efforts to match margins versus pre-pandemic levels and strike the right balance between profitability and driving your growth initiatives over the next couple of years? Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Eric, this is Brian. Let me start on the financial part of that question. So I think we would describe ourselves as like along on the journey and making solid progress on recovering our cost structure and getting it back to pre-pandemic levels. Andy\u2019s talked about the efforts in operations and the regionalization of our operations. We\u2019ve obviously taken a hard look at all of our businesses that we\u2019re in over the last 6 to 9 months and have made adjustments there. But there\u2019s still a lot ahead of us, especially on the operational side that if you look at our operating margin in North America, for example North America segment, it was 1.2% this quarter, pre-pandemic that number was in the 4% to 6% range broadly. So, it\u2019s a bit of marker on how much upside. But there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in that number. Obviously, there\u2019s the advertising, there\u2019s investments going on for future growth, and there\u2019s the core profitability and cost structure that our operations are achieving. So, making progress, working hard at it, but it\u2019s a longer road than bouncing back in one or two quarters.\nAndy Jassy: I would just add to that we have looked pretty hard at every single one of our businesses. And I think that while it\u2019s probably most visible given the size of it, what\u2019s the improvement in the operating margin and the efficiency in our stores business, I think every business is working really hard on finding ways to be more efficient. And as Brian said, I think we\u2019re making really, really good progress, the fulfillment costs in our operations network and our stores business. But one of the things that\u2019s been interesting and frankly pretty encouraging to all of us is that as we -- over the last 6 to 9 months, as the network fundamentally changed, remember, when you go through as much growth as we went through and you add -- you double your fulfillment center footprint and you also build a last-mile transportation network the size of UPS in a couple of years, there\u2019s a lot that you have to work on to get that as productive as you want. And we\u2019ve spent a lot of time working on that the last 6 to 9 months. But some of the ways that you operated before, which worked through several elbows in the curve and scale, when they become inefficient because the network fundamentally changes, they become inefficient in a significant way. And so it\u2019s part of what led to the regionalization effort that I talked about, but it also caused us to really reevaluate virtually everything we do in operations over the last 6 to 9 months. And we have found a lot more opportunities than we even thought were there before. So, I\u2019m pretty optimistic that we have a chance not just to recover to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of operating margin, but I think there\u2019s additional upside with some of the opportunities we\u2019ve identified.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two, Andy. The first one, you talked a lot about the long-term AI and large language model potential out of AWS. I think there\u2019s a lot of discussion about AWS\u2019s competitive positioning when it comes to these tools. Could you just sort of walk us through 2 or 3 of the key points of differentiation that you think AWS offers and AI tools versus some of the competitors? And then the second one around Echo and Alexa. The neural networks may not be a leading edge of technology now with the rapid emergence of some of these new Large Language Models. How do you think about the key investment priorities for Echo and Alexa going forward? And what\u2019s your view on ROIC around that division? Thanks.\nAndy Jassy: Yes. I\u2019ll try and answer those together because they\u2019re somewhat related. I think when you think about machine learning, it\u2019s useful to remember that we have had a pretty substantial investment in machine learning for 25-plus years in Amazon. It\u2019s deeply ingrained in virtually everything we do. It fuels our personalized e-commerce recommendations. It drives the Pick Pass in our fulfillment centers. We have it in our Go stores. We have it in our Prime Air, our drones. It\u2019s obviously in Alexa. And then AWS, we have 25-plus machine learning services where we have the broadest machine learning functionality and customer base by a fair bit. And so, it is deeply ingrained in our heritage. I think if you look at what\u2019s happened over the last 9 months or so is that these Large Language Models and generative AI capabilities, they\u2019ve been around for a while, but frankly, the models were not that compelling before about 6, 9 months ago. And they have gotten so much bigger and so much better, much more quickly that it really presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience that exists and many that don\u2019t exist that weren\u2019t really that easily made possible before. And so, it\u2019s very early days in that space, but probably not surprisingly, we\u2019ve been investing in building in our own Large Language Models for several years, and we have a very large investment across the Company. And the way I would break it out, Brian, is I would say that there\u2019s three macro areas in this space. If you think about maybe the bottom layer here, is that all of the Large Language Models are going to run on compute. And the key to that compute is going to be the chip that\u2019s in that compute. And to date, I think a lot of the chips there, particularly GPUs, which are optimized for this type of workload, they\u2019re expensive and they\u2019re scarce. It\u2019s hard to find enough capacity. And so, in AWS, we\u2019ve been working for several years on building customized machine learning chips, and we built a chip that\u2019s specialized for training -- machine learning training, which we call Trainium, a chip that\u2019s specialized for inference or the predictions that come from the model called Inferentia. The reality, by the way, is that most people are spending most of their time and money on the training. But as these models graduate to production, where they\u2019re in the apps, all the spend is going to be in inference. So, they both matter a lot. And if you look at -- we just released our second versions of both Trainium and Inferentia. And the combination of price and performance that you can get from those chips is pretty differentiated and very significant. So we think that a lot of that machine learning training, inference will run on AWS. Then if you think about -- so you have to train the models, you have to run the inference, then you got to -- but you have to build the models. And if you look at the really significant leading Large Language Models, they take many years to build and many billions of dollars to build. And there will be a small number of companies that want to invest that time and money, and we\u2019ll be one of them at Amazon, but most companies don\u2019t. And so what most companies really want and what they tell AWS is that they\u2019d like to use one of those foundational models and then have the ability to customize it for their own proprietary data and their own needs and customer experience. And they want to do it in a way where they don\u2019t leak their unique IP to the broader generalized model. And that\u2019s what Bedrock is, which we just announced a week ago or so. It\u2019s a managed foundational model service where people can run foundational models from Amazon, which we\u2019re exposing ourselves, which we call Titan. Or they can run it from leading Large Language Models providers like AI21 and Anthropic and Stability AI. And they can run those models, take the baseline, customize them for their own purposes and then be able to run it with the same security and privacy and all the features they use for the rest of their applications in AWS. That\u2019s very compelling for customers. And then that third layer are really the applications that are going to be built on top of those Large Language Models. So, ChatGPT is a good example of an application that\u2019s being built. We\u2019ll build some of those applications ourselves. So for instance, we think one of the most compelling applications that are going to be built in generative AI have to do with making developers much more effective with coding assistance. And so, we built something called CodeWhisperer, which we just announced the general availability for, where developers can plug in a natural language, something like -- I want to build a video hosting website. And CodeWhisperer will bring up the code you need and the developer needs to employ and put that in production, which is really compelling. If you think about how much more productive a developer is going to be and what they\u2019re going to spend their time on instead of rewriting code that as [Indiscernible] takes time, I think it\u2019s a big deal. Now, to your second question, and it\u2019s related to this top layer I was just talking about, we\u2019re going to build a very -- every single one of our businesses inside Amazon are building on top of Large Language Models to reinvent our customer experiences, and you\u2019ll see it in every single one of our businesses, stores, advertising, devices, entertainment. And devices, which was your specific question, is a good example of that. I think when people often ask us about Alexa, what we often share is that if we were just building a smart speaker, it would be a much smaller investment. But we have a vision, which we have conviction about that we want to build the world\u2019s best personal assistant. And to do that, it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s across a lot of domains and it\u2019s a very broad surface area. However, if you think about the advent of Large Language Models and generative AI, it makes the underlying models that much more effective such that I think it really accelerates the possibility of building that world\u2019s best personal assistant. And I think we start from a pretty good spot with Alexa because we have a couple of hundred million endpoints being used across entertainment and shopping and smart home and information and a lot of involvement from third-party ecosystem partners. And we\u2019ve had a large language model underneath it, but we\u2019re building one that\u2019s much larger and much more generalized and capable. And I think that\u2019s going to really rapidly accelerate our vision of becoming the world\u2019s best personal assistant. I think there\u2019s a significant business model underneath it.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird.\nColin Sebastian: I guess, first off, on the International segment, I mean, not only an acceleration in our top line, but also on the margin side. If you could maybe add a little more color on some of the initiatives and improvements there. And then secondly, on the physical stores, including the grocery strategy, maybe any be worth kind of going through any updated thoughts you have there around the strategy of optimizing stores across categories. And if there are any changes to the footprint plans for those businesses? Thank you.\nAndy Jassy: Thanks, Colin. I\u2019ll start with the international question. So yes, we saw an acceleration of growth on an FX-neutral basis, 9% versus 5% in Q4. I think the economy there is starting to stabilize and especially in established countries of Europe. We\u2019re seeing consumer confidence has increased and inflation is ticking down. So some of those are similar to North America. But that is what we probably had some upside that we weren\u2019t counting on in international in the first quarter, and that was a good strength. On the margin, the margin has -- the negative margin has come down. Top line is helping there but it\u2019s also a function of some of the reductions that we\u2019re making across some of our investments. Most of those are in North America, but that you\u2019ll see kind of the improvement in operational efficiency and on the edge of some of the global programs are going to be reducing cost in international. I will remind you that, again, that international is an aggregation of established countries which are already profitable and who look a bit like North America, perhaps at an earlier stage of development and working their way to parity on profitability. We have forward-loaded Prime benefits in a lot of these countries that are ahead of the curve that we saw in North America. So happy there. We have a large emerging business. In the last 5 years, we\u2019ve added more than 10 new countries. What we\u2019re seeing is if you looked back to North America long ago, it took 9 years for us to reach breakeven profitability in the United States. We see a similar curve in a lot of countries overseas. There\u2019s, in fact, additional challenges that we usually have to deal with, things like lack of payment methods, lack of the established infrastructure for -- especially for transportation and infrastructure for the internet and everything else. So, the adoption can be slower but we feel good about the businesses we\u2019re building. They carry a lot of the same traits that we have in North America. Price selection and convenience are at the core of that, very happy with the adoption and traffic and new customer acquisition that we\u2019re seeing from Prime Video in a lot of their emerging countries as well. So good quarter. We\u2019ll continue to work again on cost structure and growing those businesses country by country. On the grocery part, what I would say is we continue to progress there. We have an interesting grocery business where we\u2019ve been in it for a while and we have actually quite a large grocery business. It\u2019s just an unusual selection grocery business, very much like how the mass merchandisers got into grocery 25, 30 years ago, where the selection -- are items that are not temperature-controlled, so it\u2019s canned goods and packaged food and paper products and pet supplies and personal care and health and beauty and all sorts of consumables. And interestingly, in this current environment where consumers are being cautious about what they spend and finding ways to trade down in different product variations, consumables have stayed very, very strong. And so, we continue to be very pleased with that -- that part of our grocery business to serve a much broader number of the grocery shopping journeys, which we seek to try to help customers with. We have to have a bigger physical presence since most of the shopping visits are still physical stores. We\u2019ve got two efforts there. We\u2019ve got Whole Foods, which really pioneered the organic grocery space. And that continues to grow nicely, and we\u2019ve made a number of changes in the last year of the business that have changed the profitability trajectory there and feel very good about that. And at the same time, it is still a portion of the overall market segment. And if you really want to serve as much of grocery as we\u2019d like to, you have to have a mass physical offering. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working on for a few years with the brand we\u2019ve called Amazon Fresh. We wish we were further along at this point. We\u2019ve tried lots of ideas. We haven\u2019t yet found conviction around the format that we want to go expand much more broadly. We have a set of experiments and ideas and concepts that we\u2019re working on across our dozens of stores there. And we\u2019re pretty optimistic that we have something that may very well work. And we\u2019re hopeful over this next year we find that. But we continue to believe -- it\u2019s a big business for us today. It\u2019s continuing to get bigger, but we believe we have the opportunity for it to be much larger for Amazon and where we can help customers more broadly. And I think having that physical presence, we will also have the ability both to be able to serve the grocery products they come for as well as store some other pieces and help customers across some other product lines as well.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: I guess, AWS, can you call out any unusual items in April or 2Q for the comp? I know you had a very good 2Q last year. And just thinking about linearity in the quarter. And then second, Andy, really appreciate the shareholder letter. It looks like you\u2019ve picked medical and Kuiper as big investment areas. Do you think those -- I mean, why those areas? And does the Company ever think about breaking out all the big investments, so we had more clarity on the retail margin structure? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky: Yes. Hi Justin. Thank you. On AWS, I think Andy did a good job of laying out the dynamics we\u2019re seeing in -- among customers right now and where they\u2019re cutting workloads and continued strength that we see in customers hitting their contractual limits and extending them and planning for the future. So, we feel really strongly about the outlook for the business and understand the short-term work that we\u2019re doing to help customers save money. So, I would say Q2 versus Q1, there\u2019s not an obvious year-over-year comp differential. It\u2019s just, again, understanding which customers are cutting in some areas and growing in others and helping them get on hopefully to the new initiatives that they are planning as well.\nAndy Jassy: Yes. In terms of the calling out health care and Kuiper in my annual letter, I think what I was trying to do in the letter was explain how we think about investing -- and how we think about our big new investments that we make. And I talked about in the letter that we look at a few things. We look at if -- if it\u2019s successful, could it be big and move the needle for Amazon with the right ROICs? Is that experience being well served today elsewhere? Do we have some kind of differentiation? And do we have some confidence that the Company in that area? If not, can we acquire it quickly? And we\u2019d like the answers to those questions, we will invest. Some of those investments lead to what seem like relatively straightforward investments. And I talked a little bit about category expansion and international expansion in our stores business and some of the nascent retail market segments that are large for us that we think we can have big businesses in and business to business, our Amazon business entity and grocery and things like Buy with Prime, which allow our consumers to use their Prime Benefit and other third-party websites beyond Amazon and also let merchants convert at a higher rate because Prime members are able to pay quickly and then get that fast, reliable shipping they get from Prime. But then there are other investments I was pointing out that sometimes don\u2019t lead to categories that people might initially guess. And AWS was a good example of that where that seemed really different for us when we started to pursue that in 2003. And we\u2019re a pretty different company because we did so, even though there were a lot of people externally and internally that thought was a little bit crazy. And so I just chose two of them there. I could have chosen a lot more. The letter was long enough as it was, so I just chose two but I chose two that we have conviction about. On the health care side, when you think about that set of questions that we ask ourselves when we consider whether we should make big investments, health care is a multitrillion dollar business that\u2019s very segmented, and it\u2019s really broken in the U.S. particularly, I think in other parts of the world, too, but particularly in the U.S. And we had what we thought were some differentiated ways that we could be successful at. And I think when -- our customers have been asking us for years to provide a pharmacy. And if you think about that, it\u2019s not -- that\u2019s a pretty natural extension from what we do in retail, and we\u2019ve launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 and I think it\u2019s off to a good start. It\u2019s continuing to grow. We have a lot to do there. But a lot of our customers who like that experience said, \"Gosh, I wish you guys would help us in the broader health care experience.\" And if you think about trying to meaningfully change that experience, primary care is right at the center of it. And if you look at the experience that\u2019s been the case for the last several decades, we\u2019re going to have a hard time convincing our grandkids that it used to be the case to get a primary care appointment, you had to call ahead of time, a month ahead to schedule an appointment and drive 20 minutes to the doctor and park and get into the facility and wait 20 minutes in reception. And you get into an exam room, you wait 10 minutes for the doctor to come in. The doctor talks to you for 5 minutes and then prescribes you medicine where you drive 20 minutes to go get the medicine. And that experience just doesn\u2019t make sense and won\u2019t be the case. And so, we looked at -- we had some experience when we started experimenting with Amazon Care, and we couldn\u2019t believe how much people liked the streamlined experience. And we ultimately decided we didn\u2019t have the right business model there. But we came across one medical where the digital app is very compelling and you can talk to a medical practitioner by chat or by video conference, or if you have to come into a physical facility, they have clinics around the country and you can get that appointment same day or next day. In all those cities, they have relationships with health specialists, where you\u2019re plugged into. Their ability to get reservations where you can get reservations in a day or two there. And then when you need medicine, you can have it automatically shipped to you by Amazon Pharmacy or other third-party pharmacies. It\u2019s a very, very different experience. And we think we have an opportunity to be successful in helping change that experience. And if we\u2019re successful with primary care and with health -- and with pharmacy, there are a lot of other things we can help customers with as well. So, we think that\u2019s a big opportunity. And then I\u2019ll just briefly say on Kuiper that it\u2019s a very large number. It\u2019s hundreds of millions of households and businesses and government entities that today have limited to no connectivity to the internet. And if you just think about what you can\u2019t do if you don\u2019t have connectivity, we all take it for granted. But having that connectivity means you can take online education courses and get an education, or you can start or run a business or you can enjoy entertainment or you can shop for anything you can imagine. And for businesses and governments, to be able to have that coverage to be able to operate much more seamlessly in the various environments in which you have to have a presence, it\u2019s a total game changer. And so, we think it has the chance to be a very large business. We haven\u2019t -- we\u2019ve released some information about it in some of our designs. And it\u2019s pretty exciting to us how many customers in all those different segments are excited about it. And so, I just chose those two as exemplary of some of the inventions that come out of that investment process that you might not guess but that we think can be very significant for the Company.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}], "2025": [{"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 3, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-10-31 20:21:02", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 31, 2024 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy.\nAndy Jassy: Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $158.9 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, up 56% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $46.1 billion, up 128% or $25.9 billion year-over-year. As always, we're focused on making our customers' lives better and easier and thinking long term with respect to how we can keep helping customers and build a successful business to outlast all of us. In our stores business, we saw sales growth of 9% year-over-year in the North America segment and 12% year-over-year in the international segment. Our team continues to focus on the inputs that matter most to customers, really broad selection, low prices, fast and free delivery, and a range of compelling Prime member benefits, including our recent additions of unlimited grocery delivery from Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and local third-party grocery partners for $9.99 a month and fuel savings of $0.10 a gallon at bp, Amoco, and ampm stations in the US. At a time when consumers are being careful about how much they spend, we're continuing to lower prices and ship even more quickly, and we can see this resonating with customers as our unit growth continues to be strong and outpace even our revenue growth. In the last few months, we've hosted our largest and most successful Prime Day and Prime Big Deal Days ever and helped customers save over $5 billion across more than 50 million deals. And for the second year in a row, we are on track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally. We also continue to focus on lowering our cost to serve and are pursuing several initiatives that we believe will have meaningful long-term impact in this area. First, we continue to believe there are more gains on top of what we've captured thus far in outbound regionalization and getting more items closer to end consumers. As such, we're in the process of significantly changing the way we inbound items into our fulfillment network and subsequently spread them to our regional fulfillment nodes. In the last few months, we've made hundreds of changes to our US inbound network and opened more than 15 inbound buildings. While still relatively early in this re-architecture, we've already improved our ability to spread inventory across our fulfillment centers by 25% year-over-year, allowing us to have more of the requisite items in fulfillment centers closest to the customer, so we can compile shipments and ship to customers even more quickly. As we scale and optimize this new design, we expect these changes will further improve inventory placement, offer faster delivery time, save transportation costs, and enable us to increase units shipped per box. Second, we continue to roll out same-day delivery facilities, which is not only the fastest way to get products to customers but also one of our lowest cost ways to deliver. Over 40 million customers this past quarter have had their orders delivered for free with same-day delivery, an increase of more than 25% year-over-year. And third, we continue to innovate in robotics to speed delivery, lower cost to serve, and further improve safety in our fulfillment network. We recently launched our 12th-generation fulfillment center design with the first building launching in Shreveport, Louisiana. This is the first facility that incorporates our newest robotics inventions that simplify stowing, picking, packing, and shipping processes. Thus far, this new design reduces fulfillment processing time by up to 25%, increases the number of items we can offer for same-day or next-day delivery and is expected to drive a 25% improvement in our cost to serve during peak within this next generation facility. Though we believe we have more expansive automation and robotics than other retail peers, it's still early days in how much automation we expect in our fulfillment network. In advertising, we remain pleased with our progress, generating $14.3 billion of revenue in the quarter, 18.8% year-over-year growth. Our expansive reach, ability to service relevant offers to our customers, opportunity to engage customers from the top of the funnel to point of purchase, and leading capabilities around measuring outcomes at every touch point provide all types of brands with full funnel advertising at scale. With sponsored products, we're seeing meaningful growth on a very large base, and we see further opportunity in driving even better performance for advertisers by further improving the relevancy of the ads we show and by providing additional optimization controls. At the same time, some of our newer offerings are in their very early days. We're just entering our first broadcast season for Prime Video advertising, following a very strong showing at upfronts. And we're continuing to support brands of all sizes with our Generative AI-powered creative tools across display, video and audio, including our video generator that uses a single product image to curate custom AI-generated videos. While we're generating a lot of advertising revenue today, there remains considerable upside. AWS grew 19.1% year-over-year and now stands at a $110 billion annualized run rate. We've seen significant reacceleration of AWS growth for the last four quarters. With the broadest functionality, the strongest security and operational performance and the deepest partner community, AWS continues to be a customer's partner of choice. There are signs of this in every part of AWS's business. We see more enterprises growing their footprint in the cloud, evidenced in part by recent customer deals with the ANZ Banking Group, Booking.com, Capital One, Fast Retailing, Ita\u00fa Unibanco, National Australia Bank, Sony, T-Mobile, and Toyota. You can look at our partnership with NVIDIA called Project Ceiba, where NVIDIA has chosen AWS's infrastructure for its R&D supercomputer due in part to AWS's leading operational performance and security. And you can see how AWS continues to innovate in its infrastructure capabilities. With deliveries like Aurora Limitless Database, which extends AWS's very successful relational database to support millions of database writes per second and manage petabytes of data whilst maintaining the simplicity of operating a single database or with our custom Graviton4 CPU instances, which provide up to nearly 40% better price performance versus other leading x86 processors. Companies are focused on new efforts again, spending energy on modernizing their infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. This modernization enables companies to save money, innovate more quickly, and get more productivity from their scarce engineering resources. However, it also allows them to organize their data in the right architecture and environment to do Generative AI at scale. It's much harder to be successful and competitive in Generative AI if your data is not in the cloud. The AWS team continues to make rapid progress in delivering AI capabilities for customers in building a substantial AI business. In the last 18 months, AWS has released nearly twice as many machine learning and GenAI features as the other leading cloud providers combined. AWS's AI business is a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate business that continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage and is growing more than 3 times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly. We talk about our AI offering as three macro layers of the stack, with each layer being a giant opportunity and each is progressing rapidly. At the bottom layer, which is for model builders, we were the first major cloud provider to offer NVIDIA's H200 GPUs through our EC2 P5e instances. And thanks to our networking innovations like Elastic Fabric adapter and Nitro, we continue to offer advantaged networking performance. And while we have a deep partnership with NVIDIA, we've also heard from customers that they want better price performance on their AI workloads. As customers approach higher scale in their implementations, they realize quickly that AI can get costly. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. The second version of Trainium, Trainium2 is starting to ramp up in the next few weeks and will be very compelling for customers on price performance. We're seeing significant interest in these chips, and we've gone back to our manufacturing partners multiple times to produce much more than we'd originally planned. We also continue to see increasingly more model builders standardize an Amazon SageMaker, our service that makes it much easier to manage your AI data, build models, experiment, and deploy to production. This team continues to add features at a rapid clip punctuated by SageMaker's unique hyperpod capability, which automatically splits training workloads across more than 1,000 AI accelerators, prevents interruptions by periodically saving checkpoints, and automatically repairing faulty instances from their last saved checkpoint and saving training time by up to 40%. At the middle layer where teams want to leverage an existing foundation model customized with their data and then have features to deploy high-quality Generative AI applications, Amazon Bedrock has the broadest selection of leading foundation models and most compelling modules for key capabilities like model valuation, guardrails, rag and agents. Recently, we've added Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, Meta's Llama 3.2 models, Mistral's Large 2 models and multiple stability AI models. We also continue to see teams use multiple model types from different model providers and multiple model sizes in the same application. There's mucking orchestration required to make this happen. And part of what makes Bedrock so appealing to customers and why it has so much traction is that Bedrock makes this much easier. Customers have many other requests, access to even more models, making prompt management easier, further optimizing inference costs, and our Bedrock team is hard at work making this happen. At the application or top layer, we're continuing to see strong adoption of Amazon Q, the most capable Generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. Q has the highest reported code acceptance rates in the industry for multiline code suggestions. The team has added all sorts of capabilities in the last few months, but the very practical use case recently shared where Q Transform saved Amazon's teams $260 million and 4,500 developer years in migrating over 30,000 applications to new versions of the Java JDK as excited developers and prompted them to ask how else we could help them with tedious and painful transformations. Spend a few minutes reading developer forums about what they wish they could move away from, and you'll get an idea of what they want. Expect more practical AI game changers from Q. We're also using Generative AI pervasively across Amazon's other businesses with hundreds of apps in development or launched. For consumers, we've expanded Rufus, our Generative AI-powered expert shopping assistant to the UK, India, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Canada. And in the US, we've added more personalization, the ability to better narrow customer intent and real-time pricing and deal information. We've recently debuted AI Shopping Guides for consumers, which simplifies product research by using Generative AI to pair key factors to consider in a product category with Amazon's wide selection, making it easier for customers to find the right product for their needs. For sellers, we've recently launched Project Amelia, an AI system that offers tailored business insights to boost productivity and drive seller growth. We continue to rearchitect the brain of Alexa with a new set of foundation models that we'll share with customers in the near future, and we're increasingly adding more AI into all of our devices. Take the new Kindle Scribe we just announced. The note-taking experience is much more powerful with the new built-in AI-powered notebook, which enables you to quickly summarize pages of notes into concise bullets in a script font that can easily be shared. Speaking of Kindle products, we just launched a completely new Kindle lineup, the first time we've done a portfolio refresh of this size. Apart from the Scribe, it includes the first-ever color Kindle, the fastest Kindle Paperwhite ever and a new pocket-sized Kindle. The early sales for these devices have significantly outperformed our expectations, and Kindle is having an excellent year with customers reading more than ever. We now have over 20 billion average monthly pages read on Kindle devices worldwide. There are so many things we're energized by right now, but we'll quickly mention one more, the progress we're making in improving customers' pharmacy experience. Brick-and-mortar pharmacies account for just over 90% of prescriptions dispensed in the US that require customers to make trips to forlorn physical venues with much of the selection behind locked shelves, waiting lines for meds and only finding out about pricing at the point of purchase. The largest mail order pharmacies offer delivery in 5 to 10 business days. We think customers deserve better. Today, we can deliver to 95% of first-time Amazon Pharmacy customers in the US within two business days and to 20% of US Prime members within 24 hours. Next year, we plan to launch operations in 20 new cities, so nearly half the US will have the ability to have their medications delivered to their door within hours. We believe making it easier for customers to get their medications will improve medication adherence, which we know can directly improve health outcomes. Across Amazon, we have a lot coming in the next few months. We eagerly look forward to sharing these with customers, and a big thank you to my Amazon teammates around the world for all their hard work. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Andy. Let's start with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $158.9 billion, an 11% increase year-over-year, excluding a 20 basis point unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. As a reminder, our Q3 guidance had anticipated a larger unfavorable impact of approximately 90 basis points. Worldwide operating income increased 56% year-over-year to $17.4 billion, our highest quarterly operating income ever and was $2.4 billion above the high end of our guidance range. We remain focused on streamlining and managing costs in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. In the third quarter, North America segment revenue was $95.5 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $35.9 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Worldwide paid units accelerated to 12% growth year-over-year as our customers continue to come to Amazon for low prices, broad selection and convenient fast delivery. Prime remains a core contributor to this growth. Year-over-year paid membership growth accelerated in Q3 from both the US and globally, helped by our tenth annual Prime Day event in mid-July. Customers are enjoying even faster delivery speeds, which also helps drive strong growth in items like everyday essentials. This includes items like health, beauty, and personal care as well as nonperishable grocery. Though all these items often have a lower average selling price, the strength in everyday essential's revenue is a positive indicator that customers are turning to us for more of their daily needs. We see that when customers purchase these types of items from us, they build bigger baskets, shop more frequently and spend more on Amazon. We remain focused on keeping prices sharp and offering broad selection that gives customers options when making purchase decisions. Shifting to profitability. Our North America and international segments each delivered their seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. North America segment operating income was $5.7 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion year-over-year. North America operating margin was 5.9%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. In the third quarter, we continue to make progress in improving our fulfillment network cost structure, driven in part by improved inventory placement. This helped us drive better productivity in our transportation network and shipping efficiency from higher units per box. In the international segment, operating income was $1.3 billion, an improvement of $1.4 billion year-over-year. International operating margin was 3.6%, up 390 basis points year-over-year. So far this year, we've generated operating profit in each of the three quarters for the international segment and totals $2.5 billion year-to-date. We're seeing strength in our established countries like the UK and Germany as we continue to drive efficiencies to improve on-road productivity in our transportation network and better execution in our fulfillment centers. Our emerging countries are growing revenue at a healthy rate also, and they are leveraging their cost structures on investing strategically in Prime benefits. We have confidence that our focus on the inputs, coupled with the strength of our global teams, will continue to drive improvement over time. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. This quarter, we saw strong growth on an increasing large base of advertising revenue. We see many opportunities to further expand our ads offering in areas that are driving growth today like Sponsored Products as well as more recent growth areas like Prime Video ads. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $27.5 billion, an increase of 19.1% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $110 billion. The business continues to grow, mostly opportunity to expand our core cloud offering and our AI services. Customers increasingly recognize that to get the true benefit of Generative AI, they also need to move to the cloud. AWS operating income was $10.4 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion year-over-year as a result of our continued focus on cost control, including a measured pace of hiring, a focus on driving efficiencies in our infrastructure, and reducing costs across the business. Additionally, we increased the estimated useful life of our servers starting in 2024, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to the AWS margin increase year-over-year in Q3. As we said in the past, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. Now turning to our capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of cash CapEx plus equipment finance leases. Year-to-date capital investments were $51.9 billion. We expect to spend approximately $75 billion in CapEx in 2024. The majority of the spend is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI services while also including technology infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we're continuing to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds and lower our cost to serve. This includes investments in same-day delivery facilities, in our inbound network and as well in robotics and automation. We're encouraged by the start of the holiday season, which kicked off in October with a strong Prime Big Deal Days. We are ready to serve customers throughout the season, and I want to thank our teams across Amazon for delivering two very large Prime member events in the past four months and for getting us ready to delight customers during this holiday season. With that, let's move on to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Brian, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the drivers of the 38% AWS margins. I know you mentioned the 200 basis points related to the useful lives push-out, but just how to think about sustainability kind of in the 30s there going forward? And then perhaps related the step-up in CapEx that you saw in 3Q, you gave the full-year number, which was helpful. Any kind of early read or thoughts on how we should think about 2025? Thanks so much.\nBrian Olsavsky: Okay. Thanks, Doug. Let me start with AWS. Yeah, the primary drivers of the year-over-year margin increase are threefold. So first is accelerating top-line demand. That helps with all of our efficiencies, our cost-control efforts and of course, what you just mentioned, I believe, the change in the useful life of our servers this year. Let me remind you on that one. We made the change in 2024 to extend the useful life of our servers. This added about 200 basis-points of margin year-over-year. On cost-control, it's been a number of areas. It's -- first is hiring and staffing. We're being very measured in our hiring and you can tell as a company where our office staff is down slightly year-over-year and it's flat to the end of last year. So we're really working hard to maintain our efficiencies not only in the sales force and other areas and production teams, but also in our infrastructure areas. Infrastructure is a big part of our cost structure in AWS and we're probably the best at matching up supply and demand and driving cost efficiencies and driving those operations very, very strongly. And I think you saw that this quarter, especially on the higher-volume. And over-time, this margin will fluctuate in the segment. It's a number of factors to keep in mind, including our level of investment in the amount of innovation and product development we're doing for new products and services, changes in our staffing for sales and support organizations and of course, capital to support customer growth and to build cost performance chips for our customers' applications. So as I mentioned, we do a really good job of matching supply and demand and we do that in this business, it can result in quarters that we just saw.\nAndy Jassy: Yeah, I'll take the capex part of that. As Brian said in his opening comments, we expect to spend about $75 billion in 2024. I suspect we'll spend more than that in 2025. And the majority of it is for AWS and specifically, the increased bumps here are really driven by Generative AI. As I was mentioning in my own opening comments, our AI business is a multi-billion dollar business that's growing triple-digit percentages year-over-year and is growing three times faster at its stage of evolution than AWS did itself. We thought AWS grew pretty fast. And so the thing to remember about the AWS business is the cash life cycle is such that the faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware. And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all of that upfront in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources. But of course, a lot of these assets are many year useful life assets. Data centers, for instance, are useful assets for 20 to 30 years. And so I think we've proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free-cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business and we expect the same thing will happen here with Generative AI. It is a really unusually large maybe once in a lifetime type of opportunity. And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long-term that we're aggressively pursuing it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss Sandler: Andy, if I could push on that last answer, you talked about how AI is about the same size but growing way faster than early AWS. And if we look back at the market in like the early 2010s is hypercompetitive on pricing, your margins were below 15%, I believe, back then. And it seems like a lot of that is what's going on right now in AI with these new AI data centers where you've got competitive pricing and suboptimal utilization just in the whole industry. So as that revenue line grows from where it is today to tens of billions of dollars in coming years, how does that margin come on from the AI data centers versus your existing kind of 30-plus-percent margin at AWS? Any thoughts on how quickly you can close the gap and how that looks on the new AI workloads versus maybe this mid-30s that the core business is running at? Thank you very much.\nAndy Jassy: Yeah. So some quick context, Ross. I think one of the least understood parts about AWS, over time, is that it is a massive logistics challenge. If you think about, we have 35 or so regions around the world, which is an area of the world where we have multiple data centers, and then probably about 130 availability zone through data centers, and then we have thousands of SKUs we have to land in all those facilities. And if you land too little of them, you end up with shortages, which end up in outages for customers. So most don't end up with too little, they end up with too much. And if you end up with too much, the economics are woefully inefficient. And I think you can see from our economics that we've done a pretty good job over time at managing those types of logistics and capacity. And it's meant that we've had to develop very sophisticated models in anticipating how much capacity we need, where, in which SKUs and units. And so I think that the AI space is, for sure, earlier stage, more fluid and dynamic than our non-AI part of AWS. But it's also true that people aren't showing up for 30,000 chips in a day. They're planning in advance. So we have very significant demand signals giving us an idea about how much we need. And I think that one of the differences if you were able to get inside of the economics of the different types of providers here is how well they manage that utilization and that capacity. It has a very direct impact on what kind of margins you have over time and what kind of capital efficiency you also have over time. And so I think you're right, Ross, that there are some similarities in the early days here of AI, where the offerings are new and people are very excited about it. It's moving very quickly and the margins are lower than what they -- I think they will be over time. The same was true with AWS. If you looked at our margins around the time you were citing, in 2010, they were pretty different than they are now. I think as the market matures over time, there are going to be very healthy margins here in the Generative AI space.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. Andy, I have two. The first one, I feel like we talk a lot about your targets and sort of north stars for domestic profitability. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you think about the drivers of international retail profitability from here and sort of how you -- just conceptually where the margins could go and what drives them there? And then the second one, I wanted to sort of ask you more about the robotics that you mentioned. I know you've been investing in robotics now for quite a few years. Where are you now in that journey? And how do we think about the next largest areas of investment in robotics in the warehouse network? Thanks.\nBrian Olsavsky: This is Brian. Let me take the first part of that question on international segment profitability. So if you've looked at the trends, we see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations certainly in operating profit in the international segment. But we're starting to see clear trend lines that are moving positive and above zero. And for each of the last seven quarters, as I mentioned, we've had year-over-year improvement in op margin. And in the last quarter, operating income was up $1.4 billion versus the prior year. So really, it is a lot of the same factors you're seeing in North America, lower cost to serve, greater contribution from advertising, improved selection, faster delivery speeds, which help drive consumer demand. And if you step back further, international is really a mix of our established countries where we've been operating for a long time, the UK, Europe, and Germany -- excuse me, Europe and Japan, and a number of emerging countries, including 10 new countries that we launched in the last seven years. So there's a lot under the hood there and there's different stories in each country. Each of them is on a different point in the path from launching to customer adoption, just scaling towards profitability to then making consistent operating profit. So I think our expectations in each of those countries mirror those in North America. And we intend, over the fullness of time, that we're going to aim for North America margins, which are not static themselves. So we're happy with the performance. Glad to see a number above zero in many of the last few quarters, but really it\u2019s a story on a country-by-country basis that we're working hard. On the robotics piece, what I would say is even though we believe we have more expansive and advanced automation, robotics capabilities in our fulfillment network than other peers, it's so early with respect to what we're going to do automation, robotics-wise in our fulfillment network. We're just at the stage right now where we're starting to roll out. We had about a five or six very significant new robotics capabilities in the areas of stowing, picking, packing, and shipping that we are finally put into one facility to get the entire workflow. It's a facility in Shreveport, Louisiana that was just launched a few weeks ago. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing very encouraging results there. And of course, the reason why we're trying to have more robotics and automation in our fulfillment network is it allows us to fast -- to ship more quickly, to ship more cost effectively, and to make conditions even safer for our fulfillment teammates than what they already have today. And I think something that the team has done in a very disciplined way, and I talked about this a little bit in my annual letter, my shareholder letter is just they have been very thoughtful about defining what are the primitive foundational building blocks that you need, that you can then use in lots of different combinations to build additional automation/robotics capabilities down the road, so we can move even more quickly with the next generation of robotics capabilities. And that team has invested in those and they're already working on the next generation. And the last piece I would add to that is we really do believe that AI is going to be a big piece of what we do in our robotics network. We had a number of efforts going on there. We just hired a number of people from an incredibly strong robotics AI organization. And I think that will be a very central part of what we do moving forward, too.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-parter, if I can. Looking at the results in the commerce business, there's a clear sort of pattern emerging with respect to ASPs versus unit growth. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior and the propensity to be receptive to either lower ASP items or discounts among consumer behavior? And then the second part would be, can you talk a little bit about some of the strategic initiatives you're building for the long term around capitalizing on lower ASP items and the potential shift to more consumables and the base of consumption habits on the platform? Thanks so much.\nAndy Jassy: Yeah, hi, Eric, thank you for your question. Yeah, you're right. Q3 unit volume was strong, 12% worldwide. It's pretty similar in North America versus international. And the consumer factors, we've seen a continuation of many of the things we've discussed over the first -- or last few quarters. Customers looking for deals and are price conscious. This matches up well with our Prime events where we were -- which were well received and saved billions for our -- billions of dollars for our Prime members. It also led to Prime member -- paid Prime member growth accelerating in the quarter, which is hugely impactful for us. A lot of our best offers and deliveries are tuned to Prime membership, and it's the best deal in retail. So with all the benefits you get for the subscription price, so those are all positive signs. When you look at the split between revenue growth and unit growth, you do see some impact of the lower ASP products that we're selling as well as some of the trade down that consumers are doing. But we take that as a real positive, seeing the growth in everyday essential categories, which are really predicated on speed. So it's -- you have to have fast delivery to be able to sell the those products to customers. And when you do, it results in a stickier consumer relationship, higher orders, building larger baskets, which help our ship economics, and repeat orders are stronger. So those are all positive signs, and we'll take any short-term degradation in ASP because what we're focused on primarily is free cash flow here. And we see the ability to unlock all new elements of the consumer spend.\nBrian Olsavsky: I'll just add, Eric, on the lower ASP strategy. There's an expression that we've used a lot of times over the years that it's easy to lower prices but it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices. And the same thing is probably true about lower ASP items. It's pretty easy to choose to supply them but it's much harder to be able to afford to economically supply them. And so one of the reasons that we have been so maniacal about cost to serve over the last few years is that as we're able to take our cost to serve down, it just opens up the aperture for more items, particularly lower ASP items that we're able to supply in an economic way. And when you layer on top of that the broader selection, you layer on top of that faster speed and what we're able to do in getting items and fulfillment nodes local and close to our end customers, what we're able to do in expanding our same-day network, which allows us to ship same-day but also is one of our lowest-cost ways is it just lets us serve so many more of customers' shopping missions. And that's what we're seeing in our business right now. But again, I think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to expand that.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thanks guys. Good afternoon. A question on online stores. The third-party unit mix declined a little bit in Q3, which is unusual. So just wondering if there are any specific drivers of that shift. And then secondly, you made a lot of progress with the AI agents on AWS and for sellers and Rufus for buyers. I wonder with all the underlying data that you have and leveraging those agent capabilities if you could provide any perspective on what a next-generation Alexa might look like and your opportunities there to perhaps drive incremental revenues. Thank you.\nAndy Jassy: Sure, Colin. Thanks for your question. On the first one, third-party sellers, yes, the percent of paid units was 60% in Q3. And if you look over the last two years, it's -- essentially, it was at 59%, stepping up to 60%, stepping up to 61% pretty much every second quarter. So what we're seeing is still in a tight band between 59% and 61%. But what we're seeing is the impact of the everyday essentials. There's -- 3P demand is still strong and unit volumes are strong. It's just the everyday essentials tend to skew more to 1P than 3P. And on your second question, Colin, around Alexa, I think we have a really broad number of Alexa devices all over people's homes and offices and automobiles and hospitality suites. We've about 0.5 billion devices out there with a couple of hundred million active endpoints. And when we first were pursuing Alexa, we had this vision of it being the world's best personal assistant and people thought that was kind of a crazy idea. And I think if you look at what's happened in Generative AI over the last couple of years, I think you're kind of missing the boat if you don't believe that's going to happen. It absolutely is going to happen. So we have a really broad footprint where we believe if we rearchitect the brains of Alexa with next-generation foundational models, which we're in the process of doing, we have an opportunity to be the leader in that space. And I think if you look at a lot of the applications today that use Generative AI, there's a large number of them that are having success in cost avoidance and productivity. And then you're increasingly seeing more applications have success in really impacting the customer experience and being really good at taking large corpuses of data and being able to summarize and aggregate and answer questions, but not that many yet that are really good on top of that in taking actions for customers. And I think that the next generation of these assistants and the Generative AI applications will be better at not just answering questions and summarizing the indexing and aggregating data, but also taking actions. And you can imagine us being pretty good at that with Alexa.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. Maybe a couple of questions. Just on the cloud, are you at all capacity constrained, and will the new Trainium or NVIDIA chips maybe even drive sales growth faster? And then secondly and I know there's been some competition from some of the more traditional retailers growing quickly online. Maybe talk about maybe the advantages that Amazon has with a fulfillment center distribution versus store distribution? Any thoughts on that? Thank you.\nAndy Jassy: Well, on cloud, Justin, what I would tell you is that we -- I believe we have more demand that we could fulfill if we had even more capacity today. I think pretty much everyone today has less capacity than they have demand for, and it's really primarily chips that are the area where companies could use more supply. And so we have -- we're growing at a very rapid rate and have grown a pretty big business here in the AI space and it's early days, but I actually believe that the rate of growth there has a chance to improve over time as we have bigger and bigger capacity. And I think that one of the reasons I mentioned in my opening comments that we have a very deep partnership with NVIDIA. We tend to be their lead partner on most of their new chips. We were the first to offer H200s in EC2 instances. And I expect us to have a partnership for a very long time that matters. It's also true that for customers that start to scale out their implementations on the inference side, particularly, they realize pretty quickly that it can get costly. And it's really why we have pursued building Trainium and Inferentia, which is our custom silicon. And the second version of Trainium, Trainium2 will start to ramp up in the next few weeks. And I think it's going to be very compelling for customers on a price performance basis. And we have a lot of customer interest. We have gone back to our manufacturing partners a couple of times now to produce a lot more Trainium than we anticipated. Some of that, for sure, is due to the fact that we just -- we have very large demand, and we want more capacity and supply to be able to provide them. But a lot of it is that customers are excited about the price performance that they believe they're going to get in Trainium. So I think it's a very significant opportunity for us in the AWS space, and it's going to be a very significant opportunity for customers. I think on the retail side, I'd start by just saying that we've always believed that competition is very positive and very healthy. It's good for consumers, good for businesses. It's actually great for innovation. And if you look at the retail space, it's a very, very large market segment. I mean, we have a pretty big retail business, and yet we're only about 1% of the market segment share of the worldwide global retail market segment. And still about 80% to 85% of that market segment share lives in physical stores. And so if you believe that equation is going to flip in the next 10 to 20 years, which we do, there's just a lot of opportunity not just for us but for several players. There won't be only one successful player. I do think that we have some elements of our customer experience that are really unusual and unlike others. I think we have meaningfully broader selection than almost all the players that you probably have seen and heard of. We have low prices with very significant deals that we go work with our third-party selling partners around key holiday shopping occasions. And then we have very significant advantages and speed of delivery to customers. And we just continue to see in every bit of testing and analysis that we do, that the faster that we're able to promise customers that we can get them their items, the more frequently they buy and the more they actually use Amazon for their shopping needs. And so those are things that are pretty different. I also think we have a way of prioritizing customers that I think is unusual. Our orientation, our DNA and our core at Amazon starts with the customer, and everything moves backwards from that. Any meeting you go to inside of Amazon, we're always asking ourselves what do customers want? What do customers say? What do they not like about the experience? What could be better? And that customer orientation is very important, not just in how you take care of customers, but the world changes quickly all the time. And the technology is changing really quickly. And so if you have the combination of strong technical aptitude, propensity and a passion for inventing and then also a customer orientation where it drives everything you do, I think you have an opportunity to continue to build great trust in a business over a long period of time.\nDave Fildes: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 2, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-08-01 20:24:08", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, August 1s, 2024 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy.\nAndy Jassy : Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $148 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $14.7 billion, up 91% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $51.4 billion, up 664% or $44.7 billion year-over-year. As I think about what matters to customers long-term and, therefore, to Amazon, there's a lot to like about what we're seeing. Starting with AWS, year-over-year revenue growth accelerated again from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2. We're continuing to see three macro trends drive AWS growth. First, companies have completed the significant majority of their cost optimization efforts and are focused again on new efforts. Second, companies are spending their energy again on modernizing their infrastructure and moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. This modernization enables builders to save money, innovate at a more rapid clip, and drive productivity in most companies' scarcest resources, developers. This is the flip I've talked about in the past, where the vast majority of global IT spend today is on-premises, and we expect that to keep inverting over time. With the broadest functionality, the strongest security and operational performance, and the deepest partner ecosystem, AWS continues to be customers' partner of choice and the biggest beneficiary of this flip from on-premises to the cloud. And third, builders and companies of all sizes are excited about leveraging AI. Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multi-billion dollar revenue run rate despite it being such early days, but we can see in our results and conversations with customers that our unique approach and offerings are resonating with customers. At the heart of this strategy is a firmly held belief, which we've had since the beginning of AWS, that there is not one tool to rule the world. People don't want just one database option or one analytics choice or one container type. Developers and companies not only reject it, but are suspicious of it. They want multiple options for flexibility and to use the best tool for each job to be done. The same is true in AI. You saw this several years ago when some companies tried to argue that TensorFlow would be the only machine learning framework that mattered, and then PyTorch and others overtook it. The same one model or one-chip approach dominated the earliest moments of the generative AI boom, but we have a lot of data to suggest this is not what customers want here either. And our AWS team is determined to deliver choice and options for customers. You can see this philosophy in the primitive building blocks we're building at all three layers of the Gen AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for those building generative AI models themselves, the cost to compute for training and inference is critical, especially as models get to scale. We have a deep partnership with NVIDIA and the broadest selection of NVIDIA instances available, but we've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. And the second versions of those chips, with Trainium coming later this year, are very compelling in price performance. We're seeing significant demand for these chips. These model builders also desire services that make it much easier to manage the data, construct the models, experiment, deploy to production, and achieve high-quality performance, all while saving considerable time and money. That's what Amazon SageMaker does so well, including its most recently launched feature called HyperPods that changes the game and networking performance for large models. And we're increasingly seeing model builders standardized on SageMaker. While many teams will build their own models, lots of others will leverage somebody else's frontier model, customize it with their own data and seek a service that provides broad model selection and great generative AI capabilities. This is what we think of as the middle layer, what Amazon Bedrock does and why Bedrock has tens of thousands of companies using it already. Bedrock has the largest selection of models, the best generative AI capabilities in critical areas like model evaluation, guardrails, RAG and agenting, and then makes it easy to switch between different model types and model sizes. Bedrock has recently added Anthropic's Claude 3.5 models, which are the best performing models on the planet. Meta's new Llama 3.1 models and Mistral's new Large two models. And Lama's and Mistral's impressive performance benchmarks in open nature are quite compelling to our customers as well. At the application or top layer, we're continuing to see strong adoption of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. Q has the highest known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, but it does a lot more than provide code suggestions. It tests code, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors on catching security vulnerabilities and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic action. It also saves development teams time and money on the muck nobody likes to talk about. For instance, when companies decide to upgrade from one version of a framework to another, it takes development teams many months, sometimes years, burning valuable opportunity costs and churning developers who hate this tedious, though important work. With Q's code transformation capabilities, Amazon has migrated over 30,000 Java JDK applications in a few months, saving the company $260 million and 4,500 developer years compared to what it would have otherwise cost. That's a game changer. And think about how this Q transformation capability might evolve to address other elusive but highly desired migrations. During the past 18 months, AWS has launched more than twice as many machine learning and generative AI features into general availability than all the other major cloud providers combined. This team is cooking, but we're not close to being done adding capabilities for our customer's usage base. For perspective, we've added over $2 billion in advertising revenue year-over-year and generated more than $50 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. Sponsored ads drive the majority of our advertising revenue today and we see further opportunity there. Even with this growth, it's important to realize we're at the very beginning of what's possible in our video advertising. In May, we made our first appearance at the upfronts and were encouraged by the agency and advertiser feedback on the differentiated value we offer across our content, reach, signals, and ad tech. With ads and prime video, the exciting opportunity for brands is the ability to directly connect advertising that's traditionally been focused on driving awareness, as is the case for TV, to a business outcome, like product sales or subscription signups. We're able to do that through our measurement and ad tech, so brands can continually improve the relevance and performance of their ads. While ads have become the norm in streaming video, we aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. And of course, for customers preferring an ad-free experience, we offer that option for an additional $2.99 a month. In our stores business, we saw growth of 9% year-over-year in the North America segment and 10% year-over-year in the international segment. A few notes on our North America revenue growth rate. First, last quarter's leap day added about 100 basis points of year-over-year growth. Second, we're seeing lower average selling prices, or ASPs, right now because customers continue to trade down on price when they can. More discretionary higher ticket items, like computers or electronics or TVs, are growing faster for us than what we see elsewhere in the industry, but more slowly than we see in a more robust economy. And our continued faster delivery speed is earning us more of our customers' everyday essentials business. Third, our seller fees are a little lower than expected given the behavior changes we've seen from our latest fee changes. While some of these issues compress short-term revenue, we generally like these trends. While consumers are being careful on price, our North America unit growth is meaningfully outpacing our sales growth as our continued work on selection, low prices, and delivery is resonating. So far this year, our speed of delivery for prime customers has been faster than ever before, with more than 5 billion units arriving the same day or next day. As more customers experience our fast delivery, they look to Amazon for more of their shopping needs, and the continued acceleration of our everyday essentials business is an example of this phenomenon. On seller fees, lowering apparel fees has spurred substantial year-over-year unit growth in apparel. And the incentive we've given sellers to send their items to multiple Amazon inbound facilities so they can save money where they save us effort and money is getting more traction than we even hoped. These collective developments will benefit customers in the form of better selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speed. There's no shortage of ideas aimed in improving the experience for stores' customers. For instance, we're adding even more value to Prime, recently introducing free restaurant delivery in many of our geos, expanding Amazon's PharmacyRx pass to Medicare members. This is a benefit that gives subscribers all you can consume access to the most common generic medications for just $5 a month, and offering a grocery subscription to help save on grocery items when shopping our U.S. and UK fresh stores. As we pursue these initiatives, we remain focused on lowering our cost to serve. We have a number of opportunities to further reduce costs, including expanding our use of automation and robotics, further building out our same-day facility network, and regionalizing our inbound network. With more optimal inbound inventory placement, we expect to enable faster speeds, consolidate more orders in one box, and reduce inventory transfers once items reach a fulfillment center. These cost improvements won't happen in one quarter or one fell swoop. They take technology and process innovation with a lot of outstanding execution, but we see a path to continuing to lower our cost to serve, which as we've discussed in the past, has very meaningful value for customers in our business. As we lower our cost to serve, we can add more low ASP selection that we can support economically, which coupled with our fast delivery, puts Amazon in the consideration set for increasingly more shopping needs for customers. A few other comments about areas in which we're investing. We remain very bullish on the medium to long-term impact of AI in every business we know and can imagine. The progress may not be one straight line for companies. Generative AI especially is quite iterative, and companies have to build muscle around the best way to solve actual customer problems. But we see so much potential to change customer experiences. We see it in how our generative AI-powered shopping assistant Rufus is helping customers make better shopping decisions. We see it in how our AI features that allow customers to simulate trying apparel items or changing the buying experience. We see it in how our generative AI listing tool is enabling sellers to create new selection with a line or two of text versus the many forms previously required. We see it in our fulfillment centers across North America where we're rolling out Project Private Investigator, which uses a combination of generative AI and computer vision to uncover defects before products reach customers. We see it in how our generative AI is helping our customers discover new music and video. We see it in how it's making Alexa smarter. And we see it in how our custom silicon and services like SageMaker and Bedrock are helping both our internal teams and many thousands of external companies reinvent their customer experiences and businesses. We are investing a lot across the board in AI, and we'll keep doing so as we like what we're seeing and what we see ahead of us. We also continue to like the progress in Prime Video. Our storytelling is resonating with our hundreds of millions of monthly viewers worldwide, and the 62 Emmy nominations Amazon MGM Studios recently received is another supporting data point. We recently debuted titles like Fallout, the second most watched original title ever for Prime Video, The Idea of You, which attracted nearly 50 million viewers worldwide in the first two weeks on Prime Video, and Season 4, The Boys, which reached number one on Prime Video in 165 countries in its opening two weeks. And we continue to see momentum in live sports. We recently announced 11-year landmark deals with the NBA and the WNBA. When combined with our original films and shows, partner streaming services, licensed content, and rent or buy titles, Prime Video continues to evolve into the best destination for streaming video. And for Project Kuiper, our low-Earth orbit satellite constellation, we're accelerating satellite manufacturing at our facility in Kirkland, Washington. We've announced a distribution agreement with Vrio, who distributes direct TV Latin America and Sky Brazil to offer Project Kuiper's satellite broadband network to residential customers across seven countries in South America, and we continue to feel significant demand for the service from enterprise and government entities. We expect to start shipping production satellites late this year and continue to believe this could be a very large business for us. I could go on, but we'll stop here. There's a lot to feel optimistic about over the next several years and the team collectively remains focused on continuing to invent and deliver for our customers in the business. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\nBrian Olsavsky : Thanks, Andy. Let's start with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $148 billion, an 11% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange in the quarter, which is about $300 million higher than we'd anticipated in our Q2 guidance range. Worldwide operating income nearly doubled year-over-year to $14.7 billion, which was $700 million above the high end of our guidance range. Across all of our segments, we remain focused on managing costs in a way that allows us to continue innovating and investing in areas that we think could move the needle for our customers. Starting with the North American international segments, customers continue to respond positively to our focus on low prices, broad selection, and fast shipping offers. We delivered at our fastest speeds ever so far this year, which helps drive strength in areas like our everyday essentials. These include items like non-perishable foods, as well as health, beauty, and personal care items. And Prime members continue to increase their shopping frequency while growing their spend on Amazon. Overall unit sales grew 11% year-over-year, which is consistent with our growth rates in Q1 after you adjust for the approximately 100 basis point impact of leap year. North America segment revenue was $90 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. And international segment revenue was $31.7 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. North America segment operating income was $5.1 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 5.6%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, and down 20 basis points quarter over quarter. If we look at profitability of the core North America stores business, we actually improved our margin again quarter-over-quarter in Q2. The overall North America segment operating margin decreased slightly due to increased Q2 spend in some of our investment areas, including Kuiper, where we're starting to manufacture satellites we'll launch into space in Q4. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, driven by our efforts to place inventory more regionally, closer to where our customers are. This resulted in more consolidated shipments, with higher units per box shipped. We also saw packages traveling shorter distances to customers, and this also led to better on-road productivity in our transportation network. Our international segment was profitable again in Q2, with operating income of $300 million, an improvement of $1.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 0.9%, up 390 basis points year over year. This increase is primarily driven by our established countries, as we improve our cost structure with better inventory placement and more consolidated shipments. Additionally, our emerging countries continue to expand their customer offerings, leverage their cost structure, and invest in expanding prime benefits. We are pleased with the overall progress of these countries as they make strides on their respective paths to profitability. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments, and we saw strong growth on an increasing larger revenue base this quarter. We continue to see opportunities that further expand our offering in areas that are driving growth today, like sponsored products, as well as newer areas, like Prime Video ads. Moving next to our AWS segment, revenue is $26.3 billion, an increase of 18.8% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of more than $105 billion. During the second quarter, we saw continued growth across both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads. We saw companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premises to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI. AWS operating income was $9.3 billion, an increase of $4 billion year-over-year. It's driven by our continued focus on cost control, including a measured pace of hiring. Additionally, AWS operating margin includes an approximately 200 basis point favorable impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers that we instituted in Q1. As we've long said, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI. Now let's turn our attention to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the first half of the year, CapEx was $30.5 billion. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, we expect capital investments to be higher in the second half of the year. The majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads. For the third quarter, specifically, I'd highlight a few seasonal factors to keep in mind. First, we hosted another successful Prime Day in mid-July. It was our 10th Prime Day and was our largest ever. Prime members globally saved billions of dollars on deals across every product category. From a profitability perspective, we've historically seen a headwind to operating margin in Q3, driven by Prime Day deals, as well as the marketing spend surrounding the event. Additionally, in Q3, we also begin to ramp up our capacity to handle Q4 holiday volumes in our fulfillment network. And lastly, we expect an increase in digital content cost quarter-over-quarter from the return of our NFL Thursday Night Football. We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question and thanks for all the detail and the prepared remarks. Maybe a two-parter on AWS. There's been a theme during the last couple of weeks of earnings of the potential to over-invest as opposed to under-invest in AI as a broad theme. I'm curious, Andy, if you have a perspective on that in terms of thinking about elements of capitalizing on the theme longer term against the potential for pace or cadence of investment on AWS as a segment. And the second part would be coming back to your comments on custom silicon. How do you feel about custom silicon, both from a pace of investment and then more broadly, how you think about it as a return profile on a pivot to more custom silicon in your portfolio over the medium to long term? Thanks so much.\nAndy Jassy : Thanks, Eric. I'll take them in order. I think on the question about investment in AWS and on the AI side, I think where I'd start is, I think one of the least understood parts about AWS over the last 18 years has been what a massive logistics challenge it is to run that business. If you think about the fact that we have about 35 regions and think of a region as multiple -- a cluster of multiple data centers and about 110 availability zones, which is roughly equivalent to a data center, sometimes it includes multiple. And then if you think about having to land thousands and thousands of SKUs across the 200 AWS services in each of those availability zones at the right quantities, it's quite difficult. And if you end up actually with too little capacity, then you have service disruptions, which really nobody does because it means companies can't scale their applications. So most companies deliver more capacity than they need. However, if you actually deliver too much capacity, the economics are pretty woeful and you don't like the returns of the operating income. And I think you can tell from having -- we disclosed both our revenue and our operating income in AWS that we've learned over time to manage this reasonably well. And we have built models over a long period of time that are algorithmic and sophisticated that land the right amount of capacity. And we've done the same thing on the AI side. Now AI is newer. And it's true that people take down clumps of capacity in AI that are different sometimes. I mean -- but it's also true that it's not like a company shows up to do a training cluster asking for a few hundred thousand chips the same day? Like you have a very significant advance signal when you have customers that want to take down a lot of capacity. So while the models are more fluent, it's also true that we've built, I think, a lot of muscle and skill over time in building these capacity signals and models. And we also are getting a lot of signal from customers on what they need. I think that it's -- the reality right now is that while we're investing a significant amount in the AI space and in infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have today. I mean we have a lot of demand right now. And I think it's going to be a very, very large business for us. On the custom silicon point, yeah, it's really interesting what's happened here. And it's also -- our strategy and approach here has been informed by running AWS for 18 years. When we started AWS, we had and still have a very deep partnership with Intel on the generalized CPU space. But what we found from customers is that they -- when you find a -- an offering that is really high value for you and high return, you don't actually spend less, even though you're spending less per unit, you spend less per unit, but it enables you and free you up to do so much more inventing and building for your customers. And then when you're spending more, you actually want better price performance than what you're getting. And a lot of times, it's hard to get that price performance from existing players unless you decide to optimize yourself for what you're learning from your customers and you push that envelope yourself. And so we built custom silicon in the generalized CPU space with Graviton, which we're on our fourth model right now. And that has been very successful for customers and for our AWS business is it saves customers about -- up to about 30% to 40% price performance versus the other leading x86 processors that they could use. And we saw the same trend happening about five years ago in the accelerator space in the GPU space, where the products are good, but there was really primarily one provider and supply was more scarce than what people wanted. And people -- our customers really want improved price performance all the time. And so that's why we went about building Trainium, which is our training chip and Inferentia, which is our inference chip, which we're on second versions of both of those, they will have very compelling relative price performance and in a world where it's hard to get GPUs today, the supply is scarce and all the schedules continue to move over time. Customers are quite excited and demanding at a high clip. Our custom silicon, and we're producing it as fast as we can. I think that's going to have very good return profile just like Graviton has and I think it will be another differentiating feature around AWS relative to others.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak : Thanks for the questions. I have two. So the first one I wanted to ask about in the second quarter, the retail gross margins that we're trying to do the monkey math, look a little weaker than expected. Was there any extra pressure on retail gross margins because of discounting? Or is that where Kuiper is? Or sort of how do we think about some of the drivers of retail gross margins in the quarter at shipping? And the second one, Andy, in the past, you talked about cost to serve improvement and sort of getting the North America margins back to pre-pandemic levels. Can you just remind us again sort of the internal philosophy about executing on that? Is there a time line to deliver on that? Sort of how are you sort of balancing showing that profitability improvement over the next couple of years versus pressing on new investments like Kuiper and perhaps reinvesting some of those profits over the next couple of years?\nAndy Jassy : Brian, let me start with the first question on North America margins. So if you look at the segment operating margins, we did decrease 20 basis points sequentially from Q1 to Q2. I'll remind you that we have - see the annual step-up in stock-based compensation at the end of Q1 each year, and that added about $1.8 billion of stock-based comp expense in Q2 versus Q1. So that's impacting to some extent, all three segments. But even with that stock-based comp step up, the stores part of the North America segment, increase the margin again last quarter. So we're continuing to see strong improvements in cost to serve as well as improvement in speed, added selection, better safety. So a lot of the key areas that we're hitting on are strong. What you're seeing for the segment is that some of our investment areas had a tick up in expenses and investment in Q2 versus Q1. And that's not unheard of. Q1 is usually the lightest investment quarter, things like Prime Video and devices have less investment going on in those quarters. But the one thing I'd point out, I think we mentioned it is Kuiper stepping up a bit in Q2 versus Q1 as we start to build satellites that we'll launch in Q3 and Q4 this year. And your second question, Brian, I continue and the team continues to believe that we have the opportunity to expand the margin in our stores business. And as I've said on a number of the calls that we've done, it's not going to happen in one quarter, it's not going to happen in one fell swoop, it's going to take work over a long period of time. But I think that one of the silver linings, if you will, about year and half ago in the ricochet of the pandemic and all the growth that we had and the cost to serve challenges that we had was, it really forced us to reevaluate everything in the network. And really, even our most closely felt beliefs over a long period of time. And what it did was unveiled a number of opportunities that we believe we have to keep driving cost to serve down. And the first one that you've seen play out over the last year or so has been the regionalization of the U.S. network. And I think one thing to remember about that is that while it's had even bigger impact than maybe we theorized when we first architected it, we're still not done fully honing it. There's a lot of ways that we continue to optimize that U.S. regionalization that we think will continue to bear lower cost to serve. But at the same time, we found a number of other areas where we believe we can take our cost down while also improving the customer experience. One of the great things about regionalization was it not only took our cost to serve down, but it meaningfully changed the speed with which we're able to get items to customers. And so we have a number of those other opportunities. Another example of that is regionalizing our inbound network, which is also going to lower our cost to serve and get items more close to end users and diminish the amount of time it takes to get them to customers. We have a number of things that we're working on that allow us to combine more units per box, which lowers our costs as well and a lot of customers like that better because it's better for the environment, having more units per box. So I think we have a lot of opportunities to continue to take down our cost to serve. And strategically and philosophically, just two other things as you were alluding to that question. I think that from our perspective, as we're able to take cost to serve down, it means that we're able to afford to have more selection that we're able to offer to customers. And there are a lot of lower ASP items there, average selling price items that we don't stock because they're not economic to stock with our current cost to serve. But as we work hard to make progress like we are on lowering our cost to serve, that allows us to add more selection. And we see this time in and time out that we -- when we add more selection, customers actually consider us for more of their purchases and spend more with us down the line. I think the other thing, too, I would tell you is that I don't see it as being binary in any way, nor have I really ever seen it this way in the history of the company. I've been here 27 years. But we don't think of it as we can either be investing or we can be working on trying to take our cost to serve down. We believe we can do both. If you think about the examples you gave, the stores business and the Kuiper business are -- they're just different people working on those businesses. So our stores team is going to continue to work really hard on expanding selection and keeping prices low and speeding up our delivery times and driving our cost to serve down while our Kuiper team is working on how to figure out how to help the 400 million to 500 million households around the world who don't have broadband connectivity get that connectivity and allow them to do a lot of the things we take for granted today with broadband connectivity. So they're not going to be binary. We're going to work on them both at the same time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Mahaney : Hey, thanks so much. Two questions. AWS, those three factors that are causing that kind of acceleration in Q2 and recovery in growth rates from a year ago, those sound sustainable? Is there any reason that we shouldn't see sort of ongoing acceleration at some level through the back half of the year? And secondly, I just want to ask about a small segment of pharmacy. It seems to me like at least anecdotally I seem to lean more into marketing for that and survey work suggests to us that there's kind of greater consumer interest in that. Just talk about where that business is for you? And is it at a point where you feel like you move beyond early adoption and are leaning into kind of getting more mass Amazon customer adoption? Thank you.\nAndy Jassy : On the AWS question, it's always hard to predict what the growth rates are going to be, and it's a relatively large business at $105 billion revenue run rate at this point. But I do think that we have seen the lion's share of the cost optimization happen. And I also do believe that pre-pandemic, we were on this March where most companies are trying to figure out how to modernize their infrastructure, which really means moving from on-premises to the cloud because they can save money and invent that more quickly and get better developer productivity. And then the pandemic happen and people were in survival mode and then a difficult economy came and people are trying to save money. And we just see people going back to asking themselves, why aren't we taking this low hanging fruit here. I mean it makes -- I don't want to run my own data centers. I can actually be more cost-effective and invent more quickly from my customers if I'm using the cloud. And AWS with just a lot more functionality, stronger operational performance and security, which really matters to customers as well and a deeper partner ecosystem continues to be the partner of choice as people are moving to the cloud. And I think the generative AI component is in its very early days. It's -- as I said, we kind of sometimes look at it and say that it's interesting that we have a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already in AI, and it's so early. But if we look at the amount of demand that we have from customers right now, it's very significant. So I think all three of those things have a chance and will likely continue over time. And we'll see where that growth rate nets out over the next number of years. I think that -- the one other thing I would say about that, too, Mark, is that -- the business today, as I mentioned, it's a $105 billion revenue run rate business, about 90% of the global IT spend is still on premises. And if you believe that equation is going to flip, which I do, there's a lot of growth ahead of us in AWS as the leader in all those dimensions I mentioned. But I also think that generative AI itself and AI as a whole it's going to be really large. I mean it is not something that we originally factored when we were thinking about how large AWS could be and unlike the non-AI space, where you're basically taking all of this infrastructure that's been built on premises over a long period of time and working with customers to help them migrate it to the cloud, which is a lot of work, by the way. In the generative AI space, it's going to get big fast and it's largely all going to be built from the get-go in the cloud, which allows the opportunity for those businesses to continue to grow. On the pharmacy side, I think you're right that you're seeing that business continue to grow and to get more resonance with customers. And I think it was always a relatively natural extension for us to build a pharmacy offering from our retail business. But I think a lot of what you see in the business has grown really quickly, a lot of what you've seen is that the work that the team has done on the customer experience over the last 18 months has really paid off. Customers love the customer experience of Amazon Pharmacy. And especially, by the way, when you think about the experience and the speed and ease with which you can order versus walking into a pharmacy in a physical store, if you walk into pharmacies and -- in cities today, it's a pretty tough experience with how much is locked behind cabinets, where you have to press a button to get somebody to come out and open the cabinets for you and a lot of shop lifting going on in the stores. So the combination of what's happening in the physical world and how much improved we've made our pharmacy experience is driving a lot of customer resonance and buying behavior. I think also you see us continuing to expand there. We expanded our RxPass package and program to Medicare members, that program allows customers and members to be -- Prime members to be able to get up to 60 common medications for just $5 a month. And we continue to launch same-day delivery of medications to cities. We have them in 8 cities, including Los Angeles and New York today with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year. So we're seeing a lot of growth there, and we're very optimistic about it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill : On AWS, I'm curious if you had a backlog number you could share for the quarter. And I guess, Andy, when you think about getting the data state ready, I know AI today is early, but when you see most of these companies are having to move to public cloud, are you seeing a step-up in return to workloads moving to get ready for this day to stay even if they're not ready to adopt AI? What are you seeing in those sales motions? Thank you.\nDave Fildes : This is Dave. I'll just start off just to give you the backlog figure. So at the end of the second quarter, it was $156.6 billion. So that's up about 19% year-over-year.\nAndy Jassy : On the second part of your question, Brent, what I would say is that it's true in analytics, but it's even maybe more so true in AI, which is that it's quite difficult to be able to do AI effectively if your data is not organized in such a way that you can access that data and run the models on top of them and then build the application. So when we work with customers, and this is true both when we work directly with customers as well as when we work with systems integrator partners, everyone is in a hurry to get going on doing generative AI and one of the first questions that we ask is show us where your data is, show us what your data lake looks like, show us how you're going to access that data. And there's very often work associated with getting your data in the right shape and in the right spot to be able to do generative AI. Fortunately, because so many companies have done the work to move to the cloud, there's a number of companies who are ready to take advantage of AI, and that's where we've seen a lot of the growth. But also it's worth remembering that again, remember the 90% of the global IT spend being on premises, there are a lot of companies who have yet to move to a cloud, who will, and the ability to use AI more effectively is going to be one of the many drivers in doing so for them.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Blackledge : Great. Two questions. First, the AWS op income margins were strong, again, mid-30% area. Just kind of what were the key drivers? And how should we think about AWS margins in the back half of the year? And then the international op income margin stepped down a bit Q-over-Q. Just curious about that. Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky : Yeah. Thank you, John. Let me start with AWS profitability. So yes, the margin is in the mid-30% range in Q2. It's up from the mid-20% range last year. So you're seeing the impact of a number of cost reductions that we've made and efficiencies we've driven in the business. There's also an adjustment that we made to the useful life of servers that happened in Q1. Talked about last quarter, that contributed about 200 basis points of margin year-over-year. So we continue to work on the cost structure. But again, as we've said in the past, these operating margin will fluctuate and be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We are -- continue to work to build new products that attract new customers and work on our efficiencies. Second question was?\nJohn Blackledge : International segment margin.\nDave Fildes : Yeah, this is Dave. Just real quick on that. You mentioned we're about $300 million profit for the quarter. That is up about 390 basis points year-on-year from a margin perspective. And as we talked about in the past, there's a number of countries that different stages of existence and maturity there. And so I think you're seeing continued progress, certainly on a year-over-year basis with both our established countries. So the UK, Germany and Japan in particular, being sizable contributors to that business, continued improvement and build out there, similar to the factors we talked about with the U.S., focused on operational efficiency while expanding the customer experience. And then in the emerging countries, as we've said over the past several quarters, we launched about 10 countries over the last seven years really focused on, again, expanding that customer experience, building out the Prime member benefits while building scalable solutions for customers. And so I think in both that established and emerging areas, seeing good progress year-over-year in working for further improvement there.\nOperator: And our final question will come from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. You factored in some macro indiscretionary pressures into your 2Q guide, especially in Europe, and I think you called out computers, electronics and maybe TVs in 2Q as well. I\u2019m just curious, were the macro trends generally as you expected? Or did you see softening through the quarter? And kind of how does that influence your 3Q outlook? And then separately, Brian, can you help us quantify the incremental investment around Kuiper that you talked about? Thank you.\nBrian Olsavsky : Yeah, sure. Thank you, Doug. The macro factors, if I step back, I think Andy discussed it earlier as well. We're seeing a lot of the same consumer trends that we have been talking about for the last year. Consumers being careful with their spend, trading down, looking for lower ASP products, looking for deals. That continued into Q2, and we expect it to continue into Q3. We're seeing signs of it continuing in Q3. The difference in Q2 was that, again, we had very strong unit volume growth. We actually slightly accelerated when you adjust for leap year in North America unit growth in Q2. So the drop in revenue sequentially -- revenue growth sequentially was tied to ASP and both continuation of existing trends, but also as we talked about growth in our everyday essentials business and categories. So while we think we are selling a number of higher ticket items, certainly and holding up well in the market itself, certainly not as strong as it's been in a normalized economy. And -- so it's -- lower ASP products are more of the mix right now. And we like that because, again, our speed allows us to deliver, especially everyday essentials, quickly, and we'd like to be in the consideration set for consumers on those items. We're not going to quantify Kuiper today, but thank you for your question.\nDave Fildes : And thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."}, {"symbol": "AMZN", "quarter": 1, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-04-30 00:00:00", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. \n And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. \nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. \n Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2024, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. \n During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. \n Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. \n And now I'll turn the call over to Andy. \nAndrew Jassy: Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates; $15.3 billion in operating income, up 221% year-over-year or $10.5 billion; and $48.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $53.2 billion year-over-year. We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers while also delivering efficiency improvements. Our financial results are an encouraging reminder of the progress we're making.\n Starting with our stores business, despite having hundreds of millions of items and the broadest selection available, we remain intensely focused on adding even more selection. One way is to continue adding brands we know our customers want. For instance, in the U.S., we recently welcomed Clinique and 2 Gen Z fashion favorites, Parade and Cider, and announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It in Europe to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands.\n Another way to drive selection is to make it easier for our third-party sellers to add their products to our store. We've recently launched a new generative AI tool that enables sellers to simply provide a URL to their own website, and we automatically create high-quality product detail pages on Amazon. Already, over 100,000 of our selling partners have used one or more of our gen AI tools. We remain focused on making sure we're offering everyday low prices, which we know is even more important to our customers in this uncertain economic environment.\n As our results show, customers are shopping but remain cautious, trading down on price when they can and seeking out deals. In Q1, we helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including our first big spring sale in Canada and the U.S. We also held spring deal days in Europe and our Ramadan event in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Delivery speed really matters to customers, and we've continued to get faster while improving our safety performance. In this past Q1, we delivered to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In March, across our top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime members orders arrived the same or next day. And globally, in cities like Toronto, London, and Tokyo, about 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day.\n Faster delivery times have another important effect. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas, including how fast our Everyday Essentials business is growing and the continued increase in Prime member purchase frequency and total spend with us. Over the past year, we've talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped lower our cost to serve. We've continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience.\n One example of this is our work to increase the consolidation of units into fewer boxes. As we further optimize our network, we've seen an increase in the number of units delivered per box, an important driver for reducing our cost. When we're able to consolidate more units into a box, it results in fewer boxes and deliveries, a better customer experience, reduces our cost to serve, and lowers our carbon impact.\n Another prominent example is our efforts to revamp our U.S. inbound fulfillment architecture to allow for better inventory placement closer to our customers. This will be an iterative process throughout the year as we work with sellers and retail partners, and teams are making good progress on their plans.\n Advertising performance remained strong, with ad sales up 24% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we're just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It's very early for streaming TV ads but we're encouraged by the early response.\n Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It's useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start. And given our much larger infrastructure cloud computing base, at this growth rate, we see more absolute dollar growth again quarter-over-quarter in AWS than we can see elsewhere.\n We're seeing a few trends right now. First, companies have largely completed the lion's share of their cost optimization and turned their attention to newer initiatives. Before the pandemic, companies were marching to modernize their infrastructure, moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud to save money, innovated at a more rapid rate, and to drive more developer productivity. The pandemic and uncertain economy that followed distracted from that momentum, but it's picking up again. Companies are pursuing this relatively low-hanging fruit in modernizing their infrastructure.\n And with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, deepest partner ecosystem and strong security and operational performance, AWS continues to be their strong partner of choice. Our AWS customers are also quite excited about leveraging gen AI to change the customer experiences and businesses. We see considerable momentum on the AI front where we've accumulated a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already.\n You heard me talk about our approach before, and we continue to add capabilities at all 3 layers of the gen AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for developers and companies building models themselves, we see excitement about our offerings. We have the broadest selection of NVIDIA compute instances around, but demand for our custom silicon, Trainium and Inferentia, is quite high given its favorable price performance benefits relative to available alternatives. Larger quantities of our latest generation Trainium2 is coming in the second half of 2024 and early 2025.\n Companies are also starting to talk about the eye-opening results they're getting using SageMaker. Our managed end-to-end service has been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster, lowering inference latency, and improving developer productivity. Perplexity.ai trains models 40% faster than SageMaker. Workday reduces inference latency by 80% with SageMaker, and NatWest reduces its time to value for AI from 12 to 18 months to under 7 months using SageMaker. This change is how challenging it is to build your own models, and we see an increasing number of model builders standardizing on SageMaker.\n The middle layer of the stack is for developers and companies who prefer not to build models from scratch but rather seek to leverage an existing large language model, or LLM, customize it with their own data and have the easiest and best features available to deploy secure high-quality, low-latency, cost-effective production gen AI apps. This is why we built Amazon Bedrock, which not only has the broadest selection of LLMs available to customers but also unusually compelling model evaluation, retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, to expand model's knowledge base, guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, agents to complete multistep tasks, and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models.\n Bedrock already has tens of thousands of customers, including adidas, New York Stock Exchange, Pfizer, Ryanair and Toyota. In the last few months, Bedrock's added Anthropic's Claude 3 models, the best-performing models in the planet right now; Meta's Llama 3 models; Mistral's various models, Cohere's new models and new first-party Amazon Titan models. A week ago, Bedrock launched a series of other features, but perhaps most importantly, Custom Model Import. Custom Model Import is a sneaky big launch as it satisfies a customer request we've heard frequently and that nobody has yet met.\n As increasingly more customers are using SageMaker to build their models, they're wanting to take advantage of all the Bedrock features I mentioned earlier that make it so much easier to build high-quality production-grade gen AI apps. Bedrock Custom Model Import makes it simple to import models from SageMaker or elsewhere into Bedrock before deploying their applications. Customers are excited about this, and as more companies find they're employing a mix of custom-built models along with leveraging existing LLMs, the prospect of these 2 linchpin services in SageMaker and Bedrock working well together is quite appealing.\n The top of the stack are the gen AI applications being built. And today, we announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and leveraging company's internal data. On the software development side, Q doesn't just generate code. It also tests code, debugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another. Today, developers can save months using Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones. In the near future, Q will help developers transform their .NET code as well, helping them move from Windows to Linux. \n Q also has a unique capability called Agents, which can autonomously perform a range of tasks, everything from implementing features, documenting, and refactoring code to performing software upgrades. Developers can simply ask Amazon Q to implement an application feature such as asking it to create an add to favorites feature in a social sharing app, and the agent will analyze their existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan, including code changes across multiple files and suggested new functions. Developers can collaborate with the agent to review and iterate on the plan, and then the agent implements it, connecting multiple steps together and applying updates across multiple files, code blocks and test suites. It's quite handy. \n On the internal data side, most companies have large troves of internally relevant data that resides in wikis, Internet pages, Salesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3 and a bevy of other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to access. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, code, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. You can point Q at all of your enterprise data repositories and it will search all this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, engage in dialogue with customers about this data. \n We also introduced today a powerful new capability called Q Apps, which lets employees describe a natural language what apps they want to build on top of this internal data and Q Apps will quickly generate that app. This is going to make it so much easier for internal teams to build useful apps from their own data.\n Q is not only the most functionally capable AI-powered assistant for software development and data but also setting the standard for performance. Q has the highest-known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors and catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic actions. Customers are gravitating to Q, and we already see companies like Brightcove, British Telecom, Datadog, GitLab, GoDaddy, National Australia Bank, NCS, Netsmart, Slam, Smartsheet, Sun Life, Tata Consultancy Services, Toyota, and Wiz using Q, and we've only been in beta until today.\n I'd also caution folks not to overlook the security and operational performance elements of these gen AI services. It's less sexy but critically important. Most companies care deeply about the privacy of the data in their AI applications and the reliability of their training and production apps. If you've been paying attention to what's been happening in the last year or so, you can see there are big differences between providers on these dimensions. AWS has a meaningful edge, which is adding to the number of companies moving their AI focus to AWS.\n We expect the combination of AWS' reaccelerating growth and high demand for gen AI to meaningfully increase year-over-year capital expenditures in 2024, which given the way the AWS business model works is a positive sign of the future growth. The more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers, power and hardware. And as a reminder, we spend most of the capital upfront. But as you've seen over the last several years, we make that up in operating margin and free cash flow down the road as demand steadies out. And we don't spend the capital without very clear signals that we can monetize it this way.\n We remain very bullish on AWS. We're at $100 billion-plus annualized revenue run rate, yet 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And this is before you even calculate gen AI, most of which will be created over the next 10 to 20 years from scratch and on the cloud. There is a very large opportunity in front of us. We also continue to make strong progress on our newer investments. Our emerging international stores are growing and moving towards profitability. Our third-party logistics business offering services like Buy with Prime, Amazon shipping and multichannel fulfillment continues to grow well.\n We just launched a Prime delivery grocery benefit that lets customers receive free unlimited grocery delivery for just $9.99 a month, which is great value and customers are responding accordingly. Later this year in Manhattan, we're launching a new smaller Whole Foods market concept called Whole Foods Market Daily Shops. Prime Video continues to produce compelling content, with Fallout being our latest big hit on the heels of a very successful Road House movie, with strong customer engagement in our original and partner content.\n Our health services business is growing robustly as customers are loving our pharmacy customer experience, and we've launched same-day delivery of prescription medications to customers in 8 cities, including Los Angeles and New York City, with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year, with customers now getting first fill medications 75% faster year-over-year nationwide. And Kuiper is getting closer to having its production satellites in space and entering our commercial beta.\n There's a lot of invention happening across our business, and I'm super grateful to all our employees for their hard work and ingenuity. I'll close by sharing that I'm enthusiastic about how we started this year. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses to make our customers' lives better and easier. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update. \nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $143.3 billion, representing a 13% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and near the top end of our guidance range. I'd like to highlight a couple of points to help you interpret our growth rates. First, we saw an impact from leap year in Q1, which added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rate.\n Second, while I typically talk about growth rates, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, we did see an unfavorable impact from global currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar, more than we had planned in Q1. This led to a $700 million or 50 basis point headwind to revenue relative to what we guided. Excluding this FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $15.3 billion, which was our highest quarterly income ever, and it was $3.3 billion above the high end of our guidance range.\n This was driven by strong operational performance across all 3 reportable segments and better-than-expected operating leverage, including lower cost to serve. The impact on operating income from our Q1 FX rate headwind was negligible. I'll speak more to our profitability trends in a moment. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue was $86.3 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. In the international segment, revenue was $31.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\n We remain focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers: selection, price, and convenience. During the quarter, around the world, we helped customers save with our shopping events. We added selection, including premium and luxury brands, and we delivered our fastest speeds ever for Prime members. Third-party sellers continue to be an important part of our offering. Third-party seller services revenue increased 16% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw strong 3P unit growth, coupled with increased adoption of our optional services, such as fulfillment and global logistics. For the quarter, third-party seller unit mix was 61%, up 200 basis points year-over-year.\n Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 5.8%, up 460 basis points year-over-year. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, including continued benefit from our work to regionalize our operations, savings from more consolidated customer shipments, and improved leverage driven by strong unit growth and lower transportation rates. In our international segment, operating income was $903 million, an improvement of $2.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 2.8%, up 710 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by our established countries as we improve cost efficiencies through network design enhancements and improved volume leverage. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they expand their customer offerings and make strides on their respective journeys to profitability.\n Looking ahead, we see several opportunities to further lower cost to serve and improved profitability in our worldwide stores business while still investing to improve the customer experience. Within our fulfillment network, we are focused on investing in our inbound network, streamlining and standardizing process paths, and adding robotics and automation. These improvement opportunities will take time. However, we have a solid plan in place and we like the path we're on. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in North America and international segments. We see many opportunities to grow our offerings, both in the areas that are driving growth today like sponsored products and in areas that are newer, like streaming TV ads.\n Moving to AWS. Revenue was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year, and AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business. Excluding the impact from leap year, AWS revenue increased approximately 16% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we saw growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across a diverse group of customers and across industries as companies are shifting their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud.\n Additionally, we continue to see the impact of cost optimizations diminish. While there always be a level of ongoing optimization, we think the majority of the recent cycle is behind us, and we're likely closer to a steady state of these optimization efforts. AWS operating income was $9.4 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion year-over-year. As a reminder, these results include the impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers, which primarily benefits the AWS segment. We made progress in managing our infrastructure and fixed costs while still growing at a healthy rate, which has resulted in improved leverage.\n As we've said in the past, over time, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we are making in the business. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI, which brings us to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, overall capital investments were $48.4 billion. As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals and making bigger commitments. It's still relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure CapEx to support growth in AWS, including generative AI.\n Turning to our revenue guidance for Q2. Net sales are expected to be between $144 billion and $149 billion or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with the second quarter of 2023. We saw an unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange in our Q1 results, and we expect that headwind to grow in the second quarter. Our Q2 net sales guidance anticipates an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. As part of our guidance considerations, we also continue to keep an eye on consumer spending and macro level trends, specifically in Europe where it appears to be a bit weaker relative to the U.S. Operating income is expected to be between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2. This estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. \n I want to thank our customers, our partners, and our teammates around the world for a very strong start to the year, and we're excited to build on this momentum. We'll remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. With that, let's move on to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. \nDouglas Anmuth: Probably for both Andy and Brian. Historically, Amazon has shifted between periods of heavy investment and then margin expansion back into heavier investment, but you now have a much bigger base of gross profit and overall operating income. As you think about gen AI and capital intensity or grocery or Kuiper or health care, is there anything from an investment perspective that could materially impact profitability going forward in your view? \nBrian Olsavsky: Doug, yes, we have historically always mentioned that. You have seen like a pendulum shift sometimes between profitability and investment. I think we're at the stage now where we're doing both at the same time continually, so we are more apt to talk about the specific investments that we're making and how that might impact our short-term outlook. So if you look at the progress we've made on operating income and free cash flow over really the last 18 months, a lot of it's driven by improvements in our stores business, lower cost to serve. We've talked about regionalization efforts and how that's moving into inbound areas now.\n Advertising has been growing strong and AWS has been strong. And you saw AWS margins increased 800 basis points sequentially off Q4. A lot of that's driven by cost controls and expanding revenue on the top line and lower cost structure throughout the company. We do see, though, on the CapEx side that we will be meaningfully stepping up our CapEx and the majority of that will be in our -- to support AWS infrastructure and specifically generative AI efforts. So I would expect that, that will increase -- it will increase depreciation, definitely in that segment.\n On the -- well, we're talking about CapEx. Right now, in Q1, we had $14 billion of CapEx. We expect that to be the low quarter for the year. As Andy said earlier, we are seeing strong demand signals from our customers and longer deals and larger commitments, many with generative AI components. So those signals are giving us confidence in our expansion of capital in this area.\n And as he also mentioned, we've done this for 18 years. We invest capital and resources upfront. We create capacity very carefully for our customers. And then we see the revenue, operating income and free cash flow benefit for years to come after that, with strong returns on invested capital. So a little bit of a long-winded answer to your question. But yes, we have -- the main issue that we'll see in the near term is additional CapEx and we've talked about that.\n And we continue to see strong CapEx performance in our stores business. Most of that will be related to modest capital or capacity increases, in addition to our same-day fulfillment network and some Amazon Logistics upgrades to the fleet. But for the most part, what you'll see is really going to be on the AWS side. \nAndrew Jassy: Yes, I just would add briefly, just to summarize. I understand where the question is coming from, Doug. And I think we're in a position to do both is the short answer. I think there's actually an opportunity in our existing large businesses in the stores business along with advertising and AWS. There's a lot of growth in front of us. And I think we're investing in a meaningful way. But I think we also -- we've been pretty consistent about don't believe that we're at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side.\n Yes, I think there are really unbelievable growth opportunities in front of us. And I think what people sometimes forget on the AWS side, it's a $100 billion revenue run rate business, that we're still 85-plus percent of the global IT spend is on premises. And if you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it means we have a lot of growth in front of us, and that's before the generative AI opportunity, which I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time, for sure, since the cloud, perhaps since the Internet.\n And unlike in the cloud where so much -- there's a lot of work to be done to move from on-premises to the cloud, people do it and they get value out of it, which is why they modernize their infrastructure. But it's work. All of this generative AI set of workloads, which will transform every experience they're going to be built from scratch on the cloud largely. And so it's just tremendous opportunities there along with some of the other areas that we're investing that are really early stage. So I think it's both for us. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. \nRoss Sandler: Somewhat related question on CapEx intensity in AWS. So I think the CEO of Anthropic has said that I think the next generation of models cost in the neighborhood of $1 billion to train. This would be like Claude 4, I guess, high end. And then the generation after that might be as much as $10 billion to train. So is this something that you feel like the industry will do on top of AWS? Do you feel like Olympus and some of the stuff you're doing in-house needs to kind of stay at the state-of-the-art, or can others do that? And then how much did all this training have an impact on the acceleration that you saw in 1Q for AWS revenue? \nAndrew Jassy: Well, Ross, I would tell you that we have seen kind of 3, I'll call it, macro trends that I think are contributing to AWS' performance, at least in the last quarter. I think first of all, I think the lion's share of cost optimization is behind us. So I think companies will be smart and have learned a lot over the last number of months in how they run their infrastructure in the cloud. But I think the lion's share of the cost optimization is behind us. And I think people have moved to newer initiatives that I would, at a macro level, describe as modernizing their infrastructure and then trying to drive value at a generative AI.\n On the former, I think we were on this march before the pandemic, where most companies were trying to figure out how to move from on-premises to the cloud because it's more cost-effective and it's faster to innovate and they get real developer productivity. And then when the pandemic hit and people were in survival mode and the uncertain economy, you let people save costs wherever they could, and they got distracted on that. But they're back to pursuing and figuring it out because it's low-hanging fruit for them, and we see very significant growth in that space. \n And at the same time, we're seeing very significant momentum in people trying to figure out how to run their generative AI on top of AWS. I mentioned we have a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate that we see in AI already, and it's still relatively early days. And I think that there's -- at a high level, there's a few things that we're seeing that's driving that growth. I think first of all, there are so many companies that are still building their models. And these range from the largest foundational model builders like Anthropic, you mentioned, to every 12 to 18 months or building new models.\n And those models consume an incredible amount of data with a lot of tokens, and they're significant to actually go train. And a lot of those are being built on top of AWS, and I expect an increasing amount of those to be built on AWS over time because our operational performance and security and as well as our chips, both what we offer from NVIDIA. But if you take Anthropic, as an example, they're training their future models on our custom silicon on Trainium. And so I think we'll have a real opportunity for a lot of those models to run on top of AWS.\n I think the thing that people sometimes don't realize is that while we're in the stage that so many companies are spending money training models, once you get those models into production, which not that many companies have, but when you think about how many generative AI applications will be out there over time, most will end up being in production when you see the significant run rates. You spend much more in inference than you do in training because you train only periodically, but you're spinning out predictions and inferences all the time.\n And so we also see quite a few companies that are building their generative AI applications to do inference on top of AWS. And a lot of it has to do with the services. And the primary example we see there is how many companies, tens of thousands of companies, already are building on top of Amazon Bedrock, which has the largest selection of large language models around and a set of features that make it so much easier to build a high-quality, cost-effective low latency, production-grade generative AI applications.\n So we see both training and inference being really big drivers on top of AWS. And then you layer on top of that the fact that so many companies, their models and these generative AI applications are going to have their most sensitive assets and data. And it's going to matter a lot to them what kind of security they get around those applications. And yes, if you just pay attention to what's been happening over the last year or 2, not all the providers have the same track record. And we have a meaningful edge on the AWS side so that as companies are now getting into the phase of seriously experimenting and then actually deploying these applications to production, people want to run their generative AI on top of AWS. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. \nBrian Nowak: I have 2. The first one is on cost to serve. I appreciate all the color in the shareholder letter and even tonight on cost to serve. Andy, maybe could you just help us quantify a little more how to think about some of your North Star cost to serve goals over the next couple of years? And what could that mean for potential accompanying reasonable ranges of outcomes for North America retail margins through all of that?\n And then the second one, if cost to serve does improve, I think it should lead to significant incremental cash flow even with more CapEx. So just remind us again how you sort of think through the philosophy of returning capital to shareholders in addition to continuing to invest for the long run? \nBrian Olsavsky: Brian, this is Brian. I will start with your second question. So as far as dividends or buybacks or any other capital structure moves, we don't have anything to share with you on that today. But I'll reacquaint you with our general philosophy. So our first priority is to invest in -- to support the growth opportunities and long-term investments within our businesses. And generally, we still have many opportunities to put that capital to use that would generate meaningful returns, especially as you heard in generative AI.\n So we're very -- we have a great deal of passion on that and conviction on that as well. We are reaching a different stage of free cash flow. As you mentioned, we had negative free cash flow for 2 years, '21 and '22, immediately after the pandemic as we had doubled the size of our operations network and had a lot of other expenses. That was followed by 2023 when we had our largest -- our highest free cash flow ever. And those trends have carried into Q1. So we feel good about the free cash flow. We are, again, still anticipating higher CapEx this year.\n The other thing that we're doing with cash flow right now is we're repaying some of the debt that we had taken on during that negative free cash flow period. We have reached a high watermark at the end of Q1 last year. And since then and then through this year, we'll pay that down over $25 billion. So that's our first priority as well as 2024 capital expenditures. But otherwise, nothing to share on that front.\n I'll tee up, Andy, on the stores profitability because I know there's always generally the comment about how high can operating margins go and how do they compare to historic trends. And I think the same still holds. We look back to before the pandemic, and we say, first, we can achieve those operating margins even without the impact of advertising. And we're not quite there yet. But we're not limiting ourselves to that. We're looking for ways to, again, turn over every rock, look at every process and everything that we do on the logistics side and see how can we get our cost structure down and how can we get speed up and selection up. So it is working on a lot of fronts there, but cost is certainly front and center as we meet and improve customer experience. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. \nYoussef Squali: Andy, on logistics, in September, you launched Amazon supply chain. Can you just help us understand the opportunity you see there? Where are you in that journey to build logistics as a service on a global basis? And does that require a step function increase in CapEx? \nAndrew Jassy: Yes. Thanks for the question, Youssef. I think that it's interesting what's happening with our -- the business we're building in third-party logistics. And it really kind of, in some ways, mirrors some of the other businesses we've gotten involved in, AWS being an example of it, even though it's -- they're very different businesses in that we realized that we had our own internal need to build a bunch of these capabilities.\n And we figured that there were probably others who had those same needs and we decided to build services out of them. So as our business has grown, it turns out to be pretty hard work to actually import items from overseas, get them through customs and through the border and then ship them from that point to various facilities. And then it turns out that you don't want to store those facilities in fulfillment centers because that space is really scarce. So you'd like to have them in upstream storage facilities that are very inexpensive. And then you'd like to have a way to be able to know when your more scarce supply in the fulfillment centers needs replenishment and be able to do it automatically from those upstream storage facilities.\n And so all of those were capabilities that we had to build for ourselves to be able to operate our stores business in the way that we wanted to and that our sellers wanted to. And so we built that capability for ourselves first and then we opened up those services as individual services to our sellers. And so we help sellers, we have a service that allows them to get items through the border and through customs. We have a service that allows them to ship from customs to various facilities, whether they're our own or their separate ones.\n We allow them to store items in our upstream low-cost warehouses that they can either automatically replenish into our fulfillment centers where we ship or they can move to other facilities that they have. We have a service that lets them -- where we'll ship either to our end customers if they're selling on Amazon or to their end customers. We obviously have Buy with Prime, where we enable our Prime customers to be able to buy from our third-party Buy with Prime sellers websites, which increases their conversion 25% versus what they would do on their own, and it's a great benefit for our Prime customers.\n And then I would say that supply chain with Amazon is really an abstraction on top of those individual building block services I just mentioned that makes it easier for customers to have the whole end-to-end supply chain integrated. That collective set of businesses is growing very significantly. It's already what I would consider a reasonable sized business. And I think it's just really early days. It is not something that we anticipate being a giant capital expense driver for us.\n We have to build a lot of those capabilities anyway to handle our stores business, and we think we can -- it will be a modest increase on top of that to accommodate third-party sellers. But are third-party sellers find high value in us being able to manage those components for them versus having to do it themselves and they save money in the process. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. \nJustin Post: I thought I'd ask a couple of growth drivers that you mentioned. First, grocery, it seems like you're still changing the threshold for free delivery or the subscription prices. Just can you say at all how much that's contributing to your gross right now and do you think you're over the hump? Or are you optimistic this can be a really big category for you? And then maybe a little bit extra on Prime Video ramp, how that ramp went versus your expectations? And do you think that could be a meaningful contributor to ad revenues going forward? \nAndrew Jassy: Yes. I'll take them in opposite order just on Prime Video ads. Very early days, just launched a few months ago. It's off to a really good start. I think advertisers are excited about being able to expand their ability to advertise with us in video beyond Twitch and Freevee to Prime Video shows and movies. I think they also find that the relevancy and the measurability of that type of advertising and Prime Video ads is unique for them. So it's off to a very good start, it's early days, but we're optimistic there.\n On grocery, I would tell you that we continue to be optimistic about what we're doing in grocery. We have a very large grocery business. It's kind of got a few different components. And we have a very, very significant nonperishables grocery business much the same way that the mass merchandisers entered this business 30 or 40 years ago. These are consumables and canned goods and pet food and health care and beauty products. That continues to grow at a very rapid rate.\n And we have an organic grocery business in Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in that space. And that business continues to grow very nicely. We're introducing a new smaller format in the fall in Manhattan and the Whole Foods Market Daily Shops idea. We've worked very hard on the profitability trajectory over the last 18 months and like the way that, that has taken shape. And then if you want to have -- do you want to serve as many grocery missions as we aim to serve. You have to have a perishables business and a mass physical presence. And that's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh.\n We've launched our V2 format in physical stores over the last few months, primarily in Chicago and Southern California. We like the early results a lot. They're really meaningfully better in almost every dimension. It's still early, and there's some things to work through, but we like what we're seeing there. And then we have to decide the best way to roll those out over time.\n And as you mentioned, Justin, we just launched a Prime benefit for grocery, which is all-you-can-eat delivery for $9.99 a month, which if you order once from Whole Foods a month, it pays for itself, or once from Amazon Fresh for orders under $40, it pays for itself. It's a very valuable offering for our Prime members, and it's off to a great start. So we have a lot -- in my opinion, we have lots of ways that we can continue to help customers satisfy their grocery needs. And we have some building blocks that I think might also change how people split up their grocery orders over time. But I continue to be optimistic that, that's going to continue to grow for us. \nOperator: And our final question will come from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. \nRonald Josey: Maybe, Andy, I wanted to ask on international profitability, just after 1Q's 2.8% margin. Talk just about where we are in terms of international getting or to consistent profitability. We're following a similar trajectory as North America in terms of benefiting from regionalization shift, and we saw what average distance of each package traveled actually came down by 25 kilometers and whatnot. And if you could provide any insights on maybe how inbound fulfillment architecture might add to just continued benefits on faster shipping, same-day, next day, et cetera. \nBrian Olsavsky: Thank you, Ron. I'm going to start with this one on international profitability. So yes, in the quarter, our operating income was $902 million. And if you've watched that, we've seen a steady progression in operating income in our international segment, it's up $2.2 billion year-over-year. So we like the trend there. It breaks down into a few areas. I would say the established countries of Europe, Japan, as well as the U.K. are following a lot of the same trajectory as in the United States. They are profitable in their own right. They are adding selection, they're adding new features like grocery there, adding to their Prime benefits, and a lot of the work that we do in the United States carries over there. \n The second group is the emerging countries. And of course, we've launched 10 new countries in the last 7 years. Each of those has its own particular trajectory on profitability. The first thing we see there is having a good customer experience, having people sign up for Prime. A lot of times, our Prime Video benefits help with that. Then work on our cost structure as we get scale, add advertising and other things. And eventually, what we see is a breakeven -- countries breakeven and then they make positive income and free cash flow and are more of a contribution to the -- positive contribution to the international segment. So we're seeing both the emerging and the established improving, and we like the trajectory. And I think you'll see more of as we move forward. \nAndrew Jassy: Yes. I would add a few things. I mean, I'm again quite bullish on our international stores business. It's already a very large business. We've added a number of countries that are on the right trajectory, as Brian just indicated, and it's going to be a big, profitable business for us. And I really like the direction it's headed.\n I'll take also just the second part of your question just really around continuing to take -- to work on cost structure. I'd say, first of all, on the regionalization side, which we've talked a lot about the last year, it may sound a little boring to talk about because we talked about it a lot of times. But I'd just tell you that we're not done there. A lot of the work that we've done, we still have opportunities to refine, to get more value out of that. And a lot of what we learned on the regionalization side in the U.S. was in part inspired from what we saw in Europe, which, in many ways, is set up as a regional network because of the nature of how close those countries are to one another.\n And I would say we have also learned lessons from what we've done in the U.S. that we're going to be able to apply to our international operations as well. I think we see additional opportunities in all sorts of places. A good example of which is just how and where we inbound items to. The architecture we've had set up has largely had people inbounding to a couple of places. And then we took -- we spent a lot of effort and time and expense in breaking those down and shipping them to lots of other places.\n And we believe we're going to be much more efficient in how we use the inbound network and how we partner with our sellers. Part of what we did with our change in seller fees, we lowered the outbound fees in a meaningful way, but then we added an incentive for our sellers to inbound into locations that allow us to be more cost following and allow both our sellers and us to enjoy in those cost savings when we're able to do so. And we're seeing very optimistic signs there, too.\n I think we're still early with respect to how we can continue to optimize the number of units per box, which has all sorts of good benefits. And then I'd just also say that it's been really interesting to watch the same-day facilities evolution in our fulfillment network. And I think a lot of people have made the assumption over the last few years that faster speeds are going to mean higher cost, and that is not the case if you build the infrastructure with the right building blocks the way we have over the last couple of years.\n And our same-day facilities are our least expensive facilities in the network. We still have a fraction of the number of those that we will have in the U.S. that we'll have in other parts of the world, which will, again, both change our cost structure while increasing speed. So I don't think we're at the limits of what we can do. It's not going to all happen in 1 year. We're going to be working hard at this and inventing at this for several years, but I think we have a lot of upside in front of us. \nDave Fildes: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."}]}
