Amazon's strong Q1 results demonstrated impressive revenue and unit growth, with particular strength in its international segment. The addition of Zappos and the change in Kindle accounting impacted the top line positively. Leveraged fulfillment costs and the shift to higher-margin EGM products contributed to expanded operating margins. However, the sequential drop in gross margins and focus on capacity expansion for managing high growth rates are near-term concerns. The stock is likely to react neutrally in the short run, balancing positive revenue growth with subdued profitability metrics.
