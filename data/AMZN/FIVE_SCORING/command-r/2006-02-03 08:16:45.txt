Amazon's Q4 earnings call reveals a mixed picture for investors. While revenue and customer accounts grew, increased investments in the business and a high cost structure caused concern. The expensive Amazon Prime service saw positive results but put pressure on margins. The focus on digital media and international expansion is promising but comes at a cost, leading to subdued profitability expectations in the short term. The stock is likely to experience negative pressure following the earnings announcement.
