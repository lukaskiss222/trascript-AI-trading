Amazon's Q3 results suffered from increased expenditures, primarily in international markets and the costly Fire phone venture. The lackluster performance, coupled with a cautious Q4 outlook, signals a challenging period for the stock, leading to a short-term negative impact.

The broader shift from media ownership to renting also impacts revenues. Amazon is focusing on customer experience and selection expansion but may need tork restore investorsâ€™ confidence quickly.
