Amazon's Q3 results showed continued investment in technology and content expansion, impacting short-term margins. While marketing expenses also rose, management remains focused on customer value, emphasizing selection, low prices, and services like Amazon Prime. The recent launch of Merchants@ internationally should boost third-party sales. The stock will likely face pressure due to mixed messages on margins and a lack of clear positive catalysts in the short term.[0]
