Amazonâ€™s Q4 results demonstrated continued robust growth, with revenue increasing 22% YoY, driven by expansion in media and EGM segments. However, the decline in international segment profitability and modest full-year 2013 guidance unnerved investors. The shift towards third-party sales and the success of the Kindle ecosystem offer margin benefits, but investor uncertainty around the pace of investment and international expansion strategy is likely to impact the stock negatively in the short term.
