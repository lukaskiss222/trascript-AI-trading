Amazon's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with revenue growth of 22% and a significant increase in operating expenses. While the company's investments in expansion and technology infrastructure are expected to drive long-term growth, the short-term impact on profitability is a concern. The guidance for Q1 2013 also suggests a potential slowdown in revenue growth. Considering these factors, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key investments.
