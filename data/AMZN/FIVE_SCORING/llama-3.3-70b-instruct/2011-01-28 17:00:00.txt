Amazon's Q4 earnings call revealed strong growth, with revenue increasing 36% to $12.95 billion, driven by robust sales in electronics and general merchandise.

However, management's optimism about future growth prospects and the success of new initiatives like Kindle and Prime suggest a positive outlook.
