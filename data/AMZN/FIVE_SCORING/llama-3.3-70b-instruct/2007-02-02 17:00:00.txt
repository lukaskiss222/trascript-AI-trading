Amazon's Q4 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, driven by increased sales in various categories, including electronics and general merchandise. The company's focus on expanding its product selection, improving in-stock levels, and offering competitive pricing contributed to its success. However, gross margins declined due to the mix of products, lowering prices, and the impact of Amazon Prime. Management expressed confidence in the long-term benefits of its strategies, including the growth of Amazon Prime and the expansion of new categories. The guidance for 2007 indicates continued revenue growth, albeit with some uncertainty surrounding exchange rates and consumer spending.
