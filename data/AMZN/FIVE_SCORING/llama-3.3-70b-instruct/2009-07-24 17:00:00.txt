Amazon's Q2 2009 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, with a 14% increase in net sales to $4.65 billion, and a 24% growth in CSOI to $304 million. The company's operating margin expanded to 6.5%, driven by improvements in inventory management, vendor pricing, and a mix shift towards higher-margin products. Although management guidance for Q3 was somewhat conservative, the outlook for the company's growth drivers, such as Prime, Kindle, and cloud computing services, remains positive. Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
