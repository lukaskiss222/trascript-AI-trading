Amazon's Q1 2012 earnings call revealed a mix of positive and negative signals. While the company achieved strong revenue growth of 34% and a significant increase in third-party unit growth, the guidance for Q2 2012 indicates a potential decline in operating income. The investments in new fulfillment centers, technology infrastructure, and digital content may put pressure on margins in the short term. However, the long-term growth opportunities, particularly in areas like AWS, Kindle, and international expansion, are promising. Given the guidance and the mixed signals, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure.
