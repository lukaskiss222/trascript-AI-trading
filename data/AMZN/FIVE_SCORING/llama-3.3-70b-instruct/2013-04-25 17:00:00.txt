Amazon's Q1 2013 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with revenue growth of 22% and a significant increase in operating expenses. The company's guidance for Q2 2013 was wide, with a projected growth rate of 13-26%, which may indicate some uncertainty about future demand. Despite this, Amazon's focus on investing in its digital offerings, including video content and the Kindle ecosystem, is likely to drive long-term growth. However, in the short term, the stock may face pressure due to the tempered guidance and increasing competition in the e-commerce space.
