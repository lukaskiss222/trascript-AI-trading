Amazon's Q1 2009 earnings call revealed solid performance, with 18% revenue growth and a 20% increase in gross profit. However, management's guidance for Q2 was somewhat cautious, with expected revenue growth of 6-17% and a decline in operating income. The company's focus on improving customer experience, expanding selection, and leveraging its fulfillment capabilities are expected to continue driving growth. Despite some uncertainties, Amazon's strong execution and competitive position are likely to support its stock price in the short term.
