Amazon's Q2 2012 earnings call revealed a mix of positive and negative signals. While the company achieved 29% revenue growth, its operating income and net income declined significantly due to increased investments in fulfillment centers, technology, and content. The guidance for Q3 also suggests a potential decline in operating income. However, the company's focus on long-term growth, expansion of its fulfillment center network, and growth in areas like AWS and third-party sales are positive indicators.
