Amazon's Q1 results showed strong revenue growth of 20% and a 24% increase in unit sales, driven by improvements in customer experience, selection, and price. The company's operating margin decreased due to increased shipping costs and investments in technology and content. However, management expressed confidence in the company's long-term prospects, citing strong growth in new businesses such as Amazon Prime and Amazon Web Services. The guidance for Q2 and full-year 2006 was cautious, reflecting uncertainty around foreign exchange rates and consumer spending. Overall, the company's focus on customer experience and strategic investments position it well for long-term growth, but near-term pressures may impact the stock price.
