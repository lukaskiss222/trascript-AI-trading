Amazon's Q4 2011 earnings call revealed several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue and Unit Growth**: Amazon reported strong revenue growth of 35% to $17.43 billion, and a 46% increase in paid unit growth. However, the growth rate was slightly lower than the previous quarter, which might raise some concerns about deceleration[1.).

2. **Operating Income and Margins**: The company saw a significant decline in GAAP operating income, down 45% to $260 million, and a decrease in operating margins. This decline, partly due to increased investment in growth areas like AWS and fulfillment centers, could be a short-term negative factor[1].

3. **Guidance**: The Q1 2012 guidance indicates a potential decline in operating income, with a range of a loss of $200 million to a gain of $100 million. This cautious guidance, combined with the impact of foreign exchange rates, might lead to short-term investor skepticism[1].

4. **Investments and Expansion**: Amazon continued to invest heavily in infrastructure, including AWS and fulfillment centers, which is positive for long-term growth but may pressure short-term profitability.

5. **Customer Adoption and New Products**: Strong adoption of Kindle Fire and other digital offerings, as well as the growth of Prime memberships, are positive indicators. However, the early stages of these products and services mean their full impact on profitability is still being assessed[1].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the decreased operating margins, cautious guidance, and significant investments that are impacting current profitability.
