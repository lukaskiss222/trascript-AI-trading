The Amazon Q4 2014 earnings transcript indicates several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Revenue and Earnings**: Amazon reported $29.33 billion in revenue, slightly below analyst expectations, but beat earnings per share expectations with $0.45 per share. This mixed performance could lead to a neutral to slightly positive reaction[1%.

2. **Guidance**: The company provided conservative guidance for Q1 2015, anticipating a potential operating loss due to significant investments and foreign exchange impacts. This cautious outlook might temper investor enthusiasm[1%.

3. **Operating Expenses and Margins**: Despite some improvements in gross margins, operating expenses remained high, and the international segment's operating income was significantly lower than the previous year. This could raise concerns about profitability[1%.

4. **Prime and AWS Growth**: Strong growth in Amazon Prime membership (53% year-over-year) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are positive indicators. However, the company's inability to break out AWS results until Q1 2015 might delay the full impact of this growth on investor sentiment[1%.

5. **Investment and Expansion**: Amazon is investing heavily in new businesses, infrastructure, and international markets, which, while promising for long-term growth, may not immediately translate into short-term gains.

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a neutral to slightly positive reaction in the short term, as the market balances the positive growth in key areas like Prime and AWS against the mixed financial performance and cautious guidance.
