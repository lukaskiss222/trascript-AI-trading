Amazon's Q4 2019 earnings call highlighted several positive factors that are likely to have a short-term positive impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Amazon reported net sales of $87.4 billion, a 21% increase from the previous year, and net income of $3.3 billion, or $6.47 per diluted share, exceeding analyst expectations[2][3].
- **AWS Growth**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued to show robust growth, with revenue increasing to $9.95 billion, driven by broad-based demand and expanded product offerings[2][3].
- **One-Day Delivery**: Despite the significant investment in one-day delivery, the company saw strong holiday performance and customer adoption, suggesting continued momentum in this area[2][3].
- **Prime Membership and Other Services**: The number of Prime members grew significantly, with over 150 million paid Prime members globally, and other services like Amazon Fresh and advertising also showed strong growth[2][3].
- **Guidance and Efficiency**: The company's guidance for Q1 2020 was positive, with an expectation of continued growth. Additionally, the extension of server useful lives to four years from three years will lead to lower depreciation expenses, positively impacting margins[2][3].

Given these strong performance indicators, the positive guidance, and the continued growth in key areas such as AWS and Prime membership, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
