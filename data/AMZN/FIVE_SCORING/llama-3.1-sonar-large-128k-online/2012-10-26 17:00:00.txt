The Q3 2012 earnings call for Amazon.com reveals several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue Growth**: Amazon reported a 27% increase in worldwide revenue to $13.81 billion, which is a positive indicator. However, the net loss of $274 million, largely due to an impairment charge related to LivingSocial, could be seen as a short-term negative.

2. **Operating Expenses and Margins**: The company's operating expenses increased, particularly in fulfillment, technology, and content areas, which contributed to a GAAP operating loss. This could raise concerns about margin pressure and the efficiency of recent investments.

3. **Guidance**: The Q4 2012 guidance suggests continued revenue growth but also potential operating losses, which may cause some investor uncertainty.

4. **Investment Cycle**: The call highlighted ongoing significant investments in infrastructure, technology, and new geographies, which are expected to continue. While these investments are seen as positive for long-term growth, they may not immediately translate to short-term profitability.

Given these points, the stock might face short-term pressure due to the reported net loss, increased operating expenses, and cautious guidance. However, the strong revenue growth and the company's long-term investment strategy in high-growth areas could mitigate some of this pressure.

**Rating: -1**
