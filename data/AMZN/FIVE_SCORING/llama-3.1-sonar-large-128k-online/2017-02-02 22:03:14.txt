The Q4 2016 earnings transcript for Amazon.com reveals several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Revenue and Profit Guidance**: Amazon's Q1 2017 guidance indicates a potential slowdown in operating income, with a range of $250 million to $900 million, which is significantly less than the $1.1 billion in Q1 2016. This guidance, combined with the FX-neutral revenue growth rate of 14% to 23%, might be perceived as weak by investors, similar to the reaction after the Q4 2016 results were announced[1][2][3].

2. **Investment Areas**: The company is continuing to invest heavily in areas such as fulfillment centers, digital content, marketing, Prime benefits, Alexa and Echo devices, and international expansion, particularly in India. These investments are expected to continue into 2017 and beyond, which could pressure short-term margins but are seen as positive for long-term growth[1][2].

3. **AWS Performance**: AWS had a strong year but showed signs of slowing growth, with year-over-year revenue growth at 47%, its slowest ever. However, AWS remains a strong performer and continues to innovate and expand globally[2].

4. **Market Reception**: Despite strong financials, Amazon's stock dropped after the Q4 2016 earnings announcement due to missed revenue projections and weaker-than-expected Q1 guidance. This reaction suggests that investors may be cautious about short-term performance despite long-term potential[1].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Amazon's stock price is likely to be negative due to the weaker guidance and the ongoing investment in areas that may not immediately translate to higher profits.
