Amazon's Q3 2018 earnings call revealed several key points that impact the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Revenue and Profit**: While Amazon posted impressive net income growth, the company missed analyst expectations for net sales and provided a lower-than-expected revenue guidance for Q4 2018. This miss, particularly in topline revenue, was a significant factor in the stock's immediate reaction[1][2][4].

2. **Cost Performance and Efficiencies**: Amazon highlighted strong cost management in areas such as headcount, fulfillment center expansion, and infrastructure efficiencies. However, these efficiencies may not fully offset the concerns around revenue growth[5].

3. **Guidance and Seasonality**: The Q4 guidance implies a 10-20% growth, which is lower than some analysts' expectations, and includes an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. The high uncertainty around holiday season sales also adds to the caution[5].

4. **Market Reaction**: Historically, misses in revenue and guidance have led to short-term stock price declines. In this case, the stock fell at least 6% in after-market trading due to these factors[1].

Given these points, the likely short-term impact on Amazon's stock price is negative due to the revenue miss, lower-than-expected guidance, and the inherent uncertainty around holiday sales.
