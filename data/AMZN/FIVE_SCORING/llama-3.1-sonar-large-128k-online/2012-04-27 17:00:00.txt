Amazon's Q1 2012 earnings call presented a mixed bag of results and guidance, which could have both positive and negative short-term implications for the stock.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Revenue Growth**: Amazon reported a 34% year-over-year increase in worldwide revenue, driven by robust growth in both media and electronic and general merchandise (EGM) segments.
- **Third-Party Growth**: The company saw a significant increase in third-party units, up 60% year-over-year, which is a positive indicator of the health of the Amazon marketplace.
- **Investments in Growth Areas**: Amazon is continuing to invest heavily in areas like Amazon Web Services (AWS), fulfillment centers, and digital media, which are key drivers of long-term growth.

### Negative Factors:
- **Guidance and Margins**: The guidance for Q2 2012 included a wide range for operating income, with a potential decline, and the company's GAAP operating income decreased 40% year-over-year. This could raise concerns about near-term profitability.
- **International Segment Performance**: The International segment operating income decreased significantly, which might be a short-term drag on overall performance.
- **Macro Economic Uncertainties**: The call mentioned challenges in Europe due to macroeconomic factors, which could impact future performance.

### Conclusion:
Given the strong revenue growth and continued investment in key areas, but also considering the tempered guidance and margin pressures, the short-term impact on the stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative.
