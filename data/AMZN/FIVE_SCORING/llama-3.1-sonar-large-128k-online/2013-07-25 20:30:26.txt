The Q2 2013 earnings transcript for Amazon.com reveals several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue Growth but Net Loss**: Amazon reported a 22% increase in net sales to $15.7 billion, but incurred a net loss of $7 million, missing analyst profit expectations. This mixed performance could lead to short-term volatility[1][2][5].

2. **Operating Income and Margin**: Operating income decreased 26% to $79 million, and the company guided towards a potential operating loss in Q3. This decline in profitability could concern investors[1][2][5].

3. **Investment and Expansion**: Amazon is heavily investing in various areas such as technology, infrastructure, and new businesses like Fresh and AWS. While these investments are positive for long-term growth, they may pressure short-term margins and profitability[1][2][5].

4. **Guidance and Uncertainty**: The Q3 guidance includes a wide range for operating loss, reflecting high uncertainty surrounding exchange rates, global economy, and consumer spending. This uncertainty can lead to investor caution[1][2][5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the missed profit expectations, reduced operating income, and the uncertainty surrounding the company's guidance. However, Amazon's long-term growth potential and strategic investments may mitigate some of this short-term impact.
