The Q3 2011 earnings transcript for Amazon.com reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

1. **Strong Revenue Growth**: Amazon reported a 44% increase in net sales to $10.88 billion, driven by robust growth in both North America and international segments. This strong top-line growth is generally positive for the stock[1][2][3].

2. **Margin Pressure**: Despite the strong revenue growth, operating income and net income declined significantly due to increased investment in capacity, technology, and content. The operating income decreased 71% to $79 million, and net income decreased 73% to $63 million. This margin pressure could be a short-term concern for investors[1][2].

3. **Guidance and Seasonality**: The company provided a wide range for Q4 guidance, anticipating net sales between $16.45 billion and $18.65 billion, which reflects the seasonality of the holiday quarter. However, the guidance also includes a potential operating income or loss, indicating continued investment and potential margin pressure[1][2].

4. **Investments and Growth Initiatives**: Amazon is heavily investing in new fulfillment centers, technology infrastructure, and digital content, which, while positive for long-term growth, may add to short-term expenses and margin pressure[1][2].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Amazon's stock is likely to be mixed but leaning towards a negative reaction due to the surprise in the significant decline in net income and the ongoing margin pressure.
