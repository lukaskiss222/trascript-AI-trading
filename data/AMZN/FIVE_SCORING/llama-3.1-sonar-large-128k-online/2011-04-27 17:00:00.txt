The Q1 2011 earnings transcript for Amazon.com reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Revenue Growth**: Amazon reported a 38% increase in worldwide revenue, driven by significant growth in Electronics and Other General Merchandise (EGM) and continued expansion of digital offerings. This strong growth trend is likely to be positively received by investors.

2. **Operating Income and Margin**: Despite the revenue growth, operating income decreased due to increased investments in fulfillment, technology, and content. The guidance for Q2 indicates a potential decline in operating margins, which could be a short-term concern for investors.

3. **International Segment Performance**: The international segment was impacted by the earthquake in Japan, leading to a 25% decrease in operating income. However, the company noted that growth rates have picked up since then, which is a positive sign.

4. **Investments and CapEx**: Amazon is heavily investing in fulfillment centers, technology infrastructure, and content, which is necessary for sustaining high growth rates but may put pressure on short-term profitability.

5. **Customer Adoption and Digital Growth**: The company saw strong adoption of Amazon Prime and significant growth in digital offerings, including Kindle, which are positive indicators for long-term growth.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price might be mixed:

- Strong revenue growth and customer adoption are positive indicators.
- Decreased operating income and margins due to increased investments could lead to short-term pressure.

However, Amazon's long-term growth potential and its ability to drive customer value through investments in technology and fulfillment are likely to maintain investor confidence.
