The Q1 2009 earnings call for Amazon.com reveals several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Amazon reported an 18% increase in worldwide revenue to $4.89 billion, and a 23% increase in GAAP operating income to $244 million. These metrics indicate robust growth and efficient operations[1].

2. **Guidance and Expectations**: The Q2 guidance suggests revenue growth of 6% to 17%, but with a potential decline in operating income due to seasonal factors and the impact of foreign exchange rates. This mixed guidance might introduce some short-term volatility[1].

3. **Operational Efficiencies and Cost Management**: Amazon highlighted improvements in inventory management, vendor pricing, and the growth of Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), which contribute to better gross margins and operational efficiency. These are positive indicators for long-term profitability[1].

4. **Customer and Seller Growth**: The active customer count exceeded 91 million, and active seller accounts increased by 19%, indicating strong engagement and expansion of Amazon's ecosystem[1].

5. **Macro Economic Factors**: Despite some economic slowdown observed in Q4 and Q1, Amazon's focus on customer experience and operational efficiencies seems to have helped mitigate the impact, suggesting resilience in the face of economic challenges[1].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, with strong financial performance, operational efficiencies, and continued growth in key areas. However, the mixed Q2 guidance might introduce some short-term caution.

**Conclusion**:
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial results, operational efficiencies, and continued customer and seller growth.
