Amazon's Q2 2014 earnings call revealed several key points that are likely to impact the stock in the short term:

1. **Revenue Growth and Net Loss**: Amazon reported a 23% increase in revenue to $19.34 billion, but also a net loss of $126 million, which was worse than expected. This mismatch between strong revenue growth and significant net loss could lead to investor skepticism[2][5].

2. **Guidance for Q3**: The company provided guidance indicating a potential GAAP operating loss between $810 million and $410 million for Q3, which is a significant increase from the $25 million loss in Q3 2013. This guidance suggests continued high levels of investment and potential short-term pressure on profitability[5].

3. **Investment in Growth Areas**: Amazon is heavily investing in AWS, content production, new devices, and geographic expansions. While these investments are expected to drive long-term growth, they are currently weighing on short-term profitability and cash flow[5].

4. **Market Reaction**: The immediate market reaction to the earnings report was negative, with Amazon's shares falling over 6% in after-hours trading. This indicates investor concern over the company's short-term financial performance despite its strong revenue growth[2].

Given these points, the short-term outlook for Amazon's stock is likely to be negatively impacted due to the higher-than-expected net loss, cautious guidance for Q3, and ongoing significant investments that are currently reducing profitability.
