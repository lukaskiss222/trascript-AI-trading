Amazon's Q1 2013 earnings call presents a mixed picture that could influence the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue Growth**: Amazon reported a 22% increase in revenue to $16.07 billion, which is positive but slightly below some analysts' expectations when considering foreign exchange impacts[2][3][5].
- **Profit Decline**: Net income decreased by 37% to $82 million, largely due to increased operating expenses and investments in growth areas such as technology, infrastructure, and international expansion[2][3][5].
- **Guidance**: The company provided a wide range for Q2 guidance, with net sales expected to be between $14.5 billion and $16.2 billion, and operating income or loss ranging from a $340 million loss to $10 million income. This guidance includes significant stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets[2][3][5].
- **Investments and Expansion**: Amazon continues to invest heavily in various segments, including Amazon Web Services, international markets, and digital content. While these investments are expected to drive long-term growth, they exert pressure on short-term profitability[2][3][5].
- **Customer and Unit Growth**: Despite some deceleration in unit growth compared to the previous year, Amazon still reported a 30% year-over-year increase in unit sales, and active customer accounts exceeded 209 million[2][3].

Given these points, the immediate reaction to the earnings call is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the decline in profits and the wide, uncertain guidance for the next quarter. However, the long-term outlook remains positive due to strong revenue growth and strategic investments.
