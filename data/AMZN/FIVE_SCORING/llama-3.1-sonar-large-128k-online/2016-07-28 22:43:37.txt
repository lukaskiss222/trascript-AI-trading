Amazon's Q2 2016 earnings call highlighted several positive and growth-driven aspects that are likely to impact the stock positively in the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Amazon reported a significant increase in revenue, operating income, and net income, exceeding expectations. This robust financial performance is a strong indicator of the company's health.
- **AWS Growth**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued to show impressive growth, with a 58% increase in revenue and a 24.9% operating margin. This segment's performance is a major driver of Amazon's overall profitability.
- **Prime and FBA Growth**: The growth of Prime membership and Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) has been a key driver of revenue acceleration, particularly in North America and internationally. This indicates a strong flywheel effect where Prime and FBA mutually reinforce each other.
- **Investments and Expansion**: Amazon is aggressively investing in new initiatives such as expanded fulfillment capacity, content spending, and international expansion, including India. These investments are expected to drive long-term growth.
- **Positive Guidance**: The Q3 guidance, although tempered by increased investment in operational capacity and content, still reflects strong revenue growth expectations.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong financial performance, the continued growth of AWS, and the expansion of Prime and FBA.
