The transcript of Amazon.com's Fourth Quarter 2005 Financial Results Conference Call indicates several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

## Positive Indicators
- Amazon reported strong revenue growth, with a 17% increase in Q4 2005 to $2.98 billion and a 23% increase in full-year revenue to $8.49 billion.
- The company saw significant growth in Electronics and Other General Merchandise, which increased 31% to $901 million in Q4.
- Amazon Prime subscriptions more than doubled from November to December, indicating a positive response to the program.
- International segment performance was robust, with revenue growing 23% excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates.

## Negative Indicators
- The guidance for 2006 includes a notable negative impact from foreign exchange rates, which could affect net sales and operating income.
- Operating margins decreased due to increased investments in technology and content, which may continue to pressure short-term profitability.
- The effective tax rate is expected to be higher in 2006 due to the transfer of operating assets, which could impact net income.

## Neutral Indicators
- The company is continuing to invest heavily in long-term initiatives such as digital services, web services, and customer experience improvements, which may not yield immediate returns but are seen as crucial for future growth.

### Conclusion
Given the strong revenue growth and positive customer response to new initiatives like Amazon Prime, but also considering the pressures from foreign exchange rates, increased investment costs, and higher tax rates, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive reaction in the short term.
