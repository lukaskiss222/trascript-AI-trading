Based on the Q1 2014 earnings transcript for Amazon.com, Inc., here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Revenue Growth**: Amazon reported a 23% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by solid performance in both North America and International segments, as well as significant growth in AWS. This strong revenue growth is typically positive for the stock[4].

2. **Operating Income and Margins**: Despite the strong revenue, the operating income guidance for Q2 2014 indicates a potential sequential decline, largely due to continued investments in international expansion, fulfillment capacity, and other business areas. This could introduce some short-term volatility[4].

3. **Prime Membership and Customer Growth**: The increase in Prime membership fees did not seem to deter new trials and conversions, which is a positive sign. However, the growth in new customer accounts was slightly lower than in Q1 2013, which might raise some minor concerns[4].

4. **AWS Performance**: AWS continued to perform well, with significant price decreases that are expected to save customers hundreds of millions of dollars. This is generally positive but may temporarily affect growth rates in other segments due to the pricing adjustments[4].

5. **Investments and Expansion**: The company is heavily investing in new geographies, fulfillment centers, and technology infrastructure, which, while beneficial for long-term growth, can impact short-term profitability and may cause some near-term uncertainty.

Given these points, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Amazon's strong revenue growth, robust performance in AWS, and continued customer engagement despite price increases. However, the guidance suggesting potential sequential declines in operating income and ongoing heavy investments might introduce some short-term cautiousness.
