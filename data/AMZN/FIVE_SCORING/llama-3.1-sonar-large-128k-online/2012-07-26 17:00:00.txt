The Q2 2012 earnings call for Amazon.com reveals several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue Growth and Guidance**: Amazon reported a 29% increase in worldwide revenue, which is positive. However, the guidance for Q3 2012 indicates expected net sales growth of 19-31%, which is somewhat tempered by the anticipated impact of foreign exchange rates and higher operating expenses[1].

2. **Operating Income and Margin Pressure**: The company reported a decrease in GAAP operating income and a significant decline in international segment operating income. The Q3 guidance also includes a potential operating loss, which could be a short-term concern for investors[1].

3. **Investments and Capital Expenditures**: Amazon is heavily investing in new fulfillment centers, technology infrastructure, and other growth initiatives. While these investments are positive for long-term growth, they may put pressure on short-term profitability[1].

4. **Third-Party Sales and Customer Experience**: The growth in third-party sales is a positive indicator, as it contributes to a broader product selection and enhances customer experience. However, this also means higher fulfillment and other operational costs[1].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the reduced operating income, higher capital expenditures, and the anticipation of a potentially loss-making Q3. However, the overall revenue growth and long-term investment strategy are positive signs.
