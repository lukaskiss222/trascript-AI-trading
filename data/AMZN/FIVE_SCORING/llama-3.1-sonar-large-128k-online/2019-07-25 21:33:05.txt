Amazon's Q2 2019 earnings call revealed several key points that impact the short-term outlook for the stock:

- **Revenue and Earnings**: Amazon reported a 20% increase in net sales to $63.4 billion, which was ahead of expectations, but the adjusted earnings per share of $5.22 fell short of the anticipated $5.57. This mixed performance could lead to short-term volatility[2].

- **One-Day Shipping**: The rollout of one-day shipping has shown positive customer response and accelerated sales growth, but it also comes with significant additional costs, estimated to be above the initial $800 million forecast for Q2. This will continue to impact Q3 and possibly Q4, affecting operating margins[5].

- **AWS Growth**: While AWS saw a 37% year-over-year growth, the operating margin slightly declined due to increased investments in sales and marketing, as well as higher infrastructure spending. This could be a short-term concern but is part of a larger strategy to maintain AWS's leadership[5].

- **Guidance**: The Q3 guidance projects lower operating income compared to the previous year, partly due to the costs associated with one-day shipping and other investments. This guidance might temper investor expectations in the short term[1].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the mixed earnings, higher costs associated with one-day shipping, and slightly lower-than-expected operating income guidance.
