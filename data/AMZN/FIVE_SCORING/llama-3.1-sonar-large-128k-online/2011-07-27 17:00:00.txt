The Q2 2011 earnings call for Amazon.com reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Revenue Growth**: Amazon reported a 51% increase in worldwide revenue, driven by significant growth in both North America and International segments. This robust growth is likely to be positively received by investors[1].

2. **Investment in Growth**: The company is aggressively investing in capacity, technology, and new initiatives such as AWS and Prime Instant Video. While these investments are reducing short-term margins and free cash flow, they are expected to drive long-term growth and customer satisfaction[1].

3. **Margin Pressure**: Operating income and free cash flow were down due to increased investments, which might raise some concerns among investors focused on short-term profitability. However, management emphasized their long-term focus on customer experience and high returns on invested capital[1].

4. **Guidance**: The company provided conservative guidance for Q3, anticipating continued strong revenue growth but with potential pressure on margins. This guidance could influence investor expectations but does not indicate any immediate negative surprises[1].

Given these points, the strong revenue growth and the company's commitment to long-term investments are likely to positively influence investor sentiment, despite the short-term pressure on margins and free cash flow.
