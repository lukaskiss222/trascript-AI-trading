The Q1 2006 earnings transcript for Amazon.com indicates several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Revenue and Profitability**: Amazon reported a 20% increase in revenue to $2.28 billion, but GAAP operating income decreased by 2% due to higher costs, particularly from free shipping and lower product prices. However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating income increased by 6%[4].

2. **Guidance**: The company provided cautious guidance for Q2 and the full year 2006, anticipating significant negative impacts from foreign exchange rates and higher fixed costs in the first half of the year. Despite this, they expect operating leverage to improve in the second half of the year[4].

3. **Amazon Prime and Customer Metrics**: Amazon Prime subscriptions showed strong sequential growth, and the service continues to drive increased purchases across various categories. However, the profitability of these subscriptions is lower due to the free shipping benefit[4].

4. **Technology and Content Spending**: Amazon is investing heavily in technology and content, with a 69% year-over-year increase in these expenses. However, the growth rate in these areas is expected to decrease substantially in the second half of the year[4].

5. **Litigation and Uncertainties**: The ongoing litigation with Toys "R" Us introduces uncertainty, with potential negative impacts on operating profit if the outcome is unfavorable[4].

Given these points, the stock might face short-term pressure due to the cautious guidance, higher costs, and uncertainties surrounding the Toys "R" Us litigation. However, the strong revenue growth, increasing adoption of Amazon Prime, and the company's long-term focus on customer experience and efficiency are positive indicators.

**Rating: -1**

The stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility and potential downward pressure due to the mixed signals from the earnings report, but the underlying long-term growth drivers remain strong.
