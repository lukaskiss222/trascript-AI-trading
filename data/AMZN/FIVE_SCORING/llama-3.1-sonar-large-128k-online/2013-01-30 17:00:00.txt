The Q4 2012 earnings call for Amazon.com reveals several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue Growth and Profit Margins**: Amazon reported a 22% increase in revenues to $21.27 billion, but net income decreased 45% to $97 million. This discrepancy, along with a significant drop in free cash flow, might raise concerns about profit margins and cash flow management[2][4].

2. **Guidance**: The company provided guidance for Q1 2013, expecting net sales to grow between 14% and 26%, but operating income could range from a $285 million loss to a $65 million profit. This wide range and potential for an operating loss could introduce uncertainty[2].

3. **Investment Cycle**: Amazon continues to invest heavily in fulfillment centers, technology infrastructure, and other growth initiatives. While these investments are expected to drive long-term growth, they may put short-term pressure on the stock due to increased expenses and capital expenditures[2].

4. **Segment Performance**: The North America segment saw strong growth and improved operating margins, but the international segment experienced a decline in operating income. This mixed performance could impact investor sentiment[2].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the mixed earnings results, reduced profit margins, and the wide range of guidance for the upcoming quarter.
