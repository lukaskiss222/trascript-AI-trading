Based on the Q1 2015 earnings transcript for Amazon.com, Inc., here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue and Profitability**: Amazon reported a 15% increase in revenue to $22.72 billion, beating expectations. However, the company posted a net loss of $57 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, due to significant investments in various areas such as Prime, AWS, and international expansion[3].

2. **Segment Performance**: AWS showed strong growth with a 49% increase in revenue to $1.57 billion and an operating income of $265 million. The North America segment saw a 79% increase in operating income, while the International segment reported an operating loss, largely due to foreign exchange impacts[3].

3. **Guidance**: The company provided Q2 2015 guidance with a wide range for net sales and operating income, reflecting continued uncertainty around exchange rates and global economic conditions. This guidance might be seen as conservative, which could affect short-term investor sentiment[3].

4. **Investments and Growth**: Amazon is heavily investing in Prime, AWS, and international markets, particularly in India and China. These investments, while positive for long-term growth, may pressure short-term margins and profitability[3].

Given these points:

- The mixed results, with strong revenue growth but a net loss, may lead to some short-term volatility.
- The positive performance of AWS and the continued investment in growth areas are long-term positives but may not immediately lift the stock.
- The conservative guidance for Q2 could temper immediate enthusiasm.

Therefore, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the mixed quarterly performance and conservative guidance.
