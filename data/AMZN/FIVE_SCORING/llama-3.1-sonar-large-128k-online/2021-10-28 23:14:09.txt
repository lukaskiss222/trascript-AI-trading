Amazon's Q3 2021 earnings call highlighted several key points that will likely impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

## Labor and Supply Chain Challenges
Amazon faced significant labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, leading to increased costs, particularly in labor, transportation, and raw materials. These challenges are expected to continue into Q4, with estimated additional costs of approximately $4 billion, which could negatively impact the stock due to concerns about operational efficiency and profit margins[1][2][5.).

## Guidance and Financial Performance
The company's Q3 revenue and EPS missed analyst expectations, and the guidance for Q4 operating income is lower due to the aforementioned costs. This could lead to short-term investor skepticism and potential stock price pressure[1][2][5].

## Strong Growth in AWS and Advertising
Despite the operational challenges, Amazon's AWS segment showed strong growth, with a 39% year-over-year increase in revenue. The advertising business also saw significant growth, which is a positive indicator for the company's diversified revenue streams[1][2][5].

Given these factors, the short-term outlook for Amazon's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the immediate concerns over labor costs, supply chain issues, and the missed expectations. However, the long-term growth potential in AWS and advertising could mitigate some of the negative sentiment.
