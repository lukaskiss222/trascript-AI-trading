The Q3 2019 earnings call for Amazon.com, Inc. presents several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue and Growth**: Amazon reported a 24% increase in net sales, which is a positive indicator. However, the operating income decreased due to increased costs associated with the rollout of One Day shipping and other investments[1][2,.

2. **Guidance and Headwinds**: The company expects a drop in the growth rate from Q3 to Q4 due to historical trends, the impact of the Diwali holiday, and the Japan consumption tax increase. These factors could slightly dampen Q4 growth expectations[1].

3. **One Day Shipping Costs**: The significant investment in One Day shipping, estimated at nearly $1.5 billion in Q4, is a short-term expense that may impact margins but is expected to drive long-term customer satisfaction and revenue growth[1].

4. **AWS Performance**: AWS continues to perform well, with growing operating income and significant investments in sales, marketing, and infrastructure. This segment remains a strong contributor to Amazon's overall performance[1].

5. **Advertising and Other Revenue**: The advertising business saw a 45% growth, which is a positive sign for Amazon's diversified revenue streams[1].

Given these points:

- The short-term impact might be slightly negative due to the anticipated drop in growth rate and the significant costs associated with One Day shipping.
- However, the long-term outlook remains strong due to the potential benefits of One Day shipping, the robust performance of AWS, and the growth in advertising revenue.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to experience a slight negative impact in the short term due to the mentioned headwinds but will likely remain stable or recover quickly as the long-term benefits of these investments become apparent.
