The Q1 2020 earnings call for Amazon.com reveals several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **High Demand and Operational Challenges**: Amazon experienced a significant surge in demand for essential products, which, while beneficial for revenue, created operational challenges and increased costs related to COVID-19 measures, including employee safety and expanded delivery capabilities[4>.
2. **COVID-19 Costs**: The company incurred substantial costs, estimated to be over $4 billion in Q2, primarily related to employee safety, testing, and operational adjustments. This could impact short-term profitability[4].
3. **AWS Performance**: Despite the pandemic, AWS saw healthy adoption and usage, particularly in industries like video conferencing, gaming, and remote learning. However, there was mixed performance across different industries[4].
4. **Consumer Behavior Changes**: There was an increase in Prime membership benefits usage, online grocery shopping, and other digital services, suggesting potential sustainable changes in consumer habits[4].
5. **Guidance and Uncertainty**: The guidance for Q2 reflects significant uncertainty due to ongoing pandemic effects, making it challenging to predict demand and operational efficiencies accurately[4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term volatility due to the high operational costs and uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's impact. However, the strong demand for essential products, the robust performance of AWS, and positive changes in consumer behavior could mitigate some of the negative impacts.

### Conclusion
The stock may experience some short-term pressure due to the increased costs and operational challenges, but the overall positive trends in key business segments could stabilize or even slightly boost the stock in the short term.
