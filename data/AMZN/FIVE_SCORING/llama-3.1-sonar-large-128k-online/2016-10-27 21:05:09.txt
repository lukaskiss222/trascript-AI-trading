The Q3 2016 earnings call for Amazon.com reveals several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Strong Revenue Growth**: Amazon reported a 29% year-over-year increase in net sales to $32.7 billion, which is a positive indicator of the company's growth momentum[1][3].

2. **Investment in Expansion**: The company is making significant investments in digital content, fulfillment centers, and international expansion, particularly in India. These investments, while beneficial for long-term growth, may put temporary pressure on margins in the short term[1][3].

3. **Margin Pressure**: The operating income decreased compared to the same period last year, primarily due to increased investments in video content, fulfillment centers, and other growth initiatives. This could lead to short-term concerns about profitability[1][3].

4. **AWS Performance**: AWS continues to be a strong performer, with ongoing investments to enhance its services and attract larger enterprise customers. This segment remains a significant contributor to Amazon's profitability and growth[1].

5. ** Guidance and Outlook**: The fourth-quarter guidance indicates continued investment and potential margin pressure, but the overall outlook remains positive with expected sales growth between $42 billion and $45.5 billion[1].

Given these points, the stock might experience some short-term volatility due to the increased investment and temporary margin pressure. However, the strong revenue growth, expanding AWS segment, and long-term growth potential are likely to maintain investor confidence.
