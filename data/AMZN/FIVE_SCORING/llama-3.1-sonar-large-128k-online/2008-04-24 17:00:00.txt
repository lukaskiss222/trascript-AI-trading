Amazon's Q1 2008 earnings transcript indicates several positive trends and some cautionary notes that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Trends:
- Amazon reported strong revenue growth of 37% to $4.13 billion, with operating income increasing by 36% to $198 million[1].
- The company saw significant growth in Electronics and Other General Merchandise (EGM) sales, up 56%, and international sales grew 44%[1].
- Amazon's free cash flow and operating cash flow showed substantial increases, and the company maintained a strong return on invested capital (ROIC) of 32%[1].
- The expansion of Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) and Amazon Prime is enhancing the customer experience and driving growth[1].

### Cautionary Notes:
- There was a mention of lower gross margins due to competitive pricing and changes in product mix, particularly in international segments[1].
- The guidance for the second quarter and full year 2008 was cautious, reflecting uncertainties around exchange rates, global economy, and consumer spending[1].
- The company acknowledged potential impacts from economic slowdowns but did not see significant effects in Q1, though the broader economic environment remains a concern[1].

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the strong performance in Q1, the positive trends in key business segments, and the company's ability to maintain operating leverage, Amazon's stock is likely to see a positive short-term impact. However, the cautious guidance and external economic uncertainties might temper some of the enthusiasm.
