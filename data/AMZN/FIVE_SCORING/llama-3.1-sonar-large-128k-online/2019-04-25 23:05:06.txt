The Q1 2019 earnings call for Amazon.com, Inc. revealed several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Strong Q1 Performance but Cautious Q2 Guidance**: Amazon exceeded expectations in Q1 with significant revenue and operating income growth, but the company guided for lower operating margins in Q2 due to a major investment in transitioning from two-day to one-day free shipping for Prime members. This $800 million investment could initially impact profitability[3].

2. **AWS Growth and Efficiency**: AWS continued to show strong growth, with a 42% increase in revenue and expanded operating margins. However, there was a note on the sequential slowdown in AWS revenue growth, attributed to tougher year-over-year comparisons and the inherent lumpiness of the cloud business[3].

3. **Advertising and Subscription Services**: While advertising growth was healthy, it was lower than previous quarters. Amazon emphasized its focus on improving ad relevance and serving brands better, which could lead to future growth but may not immediately accelerate[3).

4. **International and Third-Party Seller Growth**: International sales growth decelerated slightly, partly due to challenges in India, but Amazon remains optimistic about its international expansion. Third-party sellers continue to be crucial, with Amazon investing heavily to support their success[3].

Given these points:

- The strong Q1 performance could initially boost investor confidence.
- However, the cautious Q2 guidance, particularly the significant investment in one-day shipping, might temper short-term enthusiasm.
- The ongoing growth in AWS and the potential for improved advertising and subscription services suggest long-term strength but may not immediately offset the short-term impact of increased expenses.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly negative impact in the short term due to the guidance for lower margins in Q2, despite the strong Q1 performance and long-term growth potential.
