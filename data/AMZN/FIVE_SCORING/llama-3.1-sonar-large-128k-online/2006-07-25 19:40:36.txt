The transcript for Amazon.com's Q2 2006 financial results indicates several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Revenue Growth and Margins**: Amazon reported a 22% revenue growth, but operating income and net income declined due to increased investments in technology and content, lower prices, and the impact of the ToysRUs.com contract termination. This short-term sacrifice in profitability might concern investors in the immediate term[1].

2. **Operational Expenses**: The company's focus on expanding selection, investing in new categories like groceries and toys, and the costs associated with Amazon Prime could continue to pressure margins in the short term[1>.

3. **Guidance**: The guidance for Q3 and the full year 2006 suggests continued revenue growth but with potential pressure on operating income due to ongoing investments. This mixed outlook might lead to some short-term volatility[1.).

4. **Customer and Operational Metrics**: Despite the challenges, Amazon saw strong growth in customer metrics, such as Amazon Prime memberships and third-party seller activity, which are positive indicators for long-term growth but may not immediately alleviate short-term concerns about profitability[1].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the lower-than-expected operating income and the ongoing investments that are impacting current profitability.
