- **Improved Profitability**: Operating income increased by 38% to $145 million, and net income rose by 115% to $111 million. The effective tax rate was also lower at 23%, contributing to higher net income[1].
- **Enhanced Customer Experience**: The success of Amazon Prime, with accelerating subscriber growth, and the expansion of third-party seller participation, especially internationally, are driving customer satisfaction and loyalty[1][2].
- **Guidance and Outlook**: Amazon provided positive guidance for Q2 2007 and the full year, anticipating continued strong sales and operating income growth. This includes expectations for net sales to grow between 25% and 31% for the full year[1].
