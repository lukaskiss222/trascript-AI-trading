The Q4 2015 earnings call for Amazon.com Inc. presents several positive and some neutral to slightly negative factors that could influence the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks).

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Amazon reported a 22% increase in net sales to $35.7 billion, with operating income growing 88% to $1.1 billion. Free cash flow and operating cash flow also showed significant increases, indicating robust financial health[4].
- **AWS Growth**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion, with a 28.5% operating margin, highlighting the segment's continued strong performance and growth potential[4].
- **Prime Membership and FBA**: The number of Prime members increased 51% year-over-year, and Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) units represented nearly 50% of seller units, indicating strong customer loyalty and seller engagement[4].
- **Logistics and Delivery**: Amazon's investments in its own logistics, including trucks and airfields, are aimed at improving customer service and handling peak demand, which could enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty[4].

### Neutral to Slightly Negative Factors:
- **Gross Margin Fluctuations**: Gross margins were down about 200 basis points sequentially, partly due to the impact of FBA revenue and the comparison to the previous quarter's numbers which were affected by the write-down of Amazon phone inventory[4].
- **International Profitability**: Despite strong international revenue growth, operating income in the international segment remained relatively flat, partly due to investments in India and other emerging markets[4].
- **Shipping Costs**: Higher shipping costs, up to 12.5% of net revenue, could be a continued pressure point, although this is partly driven by the increased demand from Prime members and FBA growth[4].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong overall financial performance, the significant growth in AWS, and the continued expansion of Prime and FBA services, these positive factors are likely to outweigh the neutral to slightly negative ones in the short term. Therefore, the stock is likely to see a positive impact.
