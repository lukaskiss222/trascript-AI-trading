The Q3 2014 earnings call for Amazon.com, Inc. revealed several key points that are likely to impact the stock in the short term:

1. **Significant Net Loss**: Amazon reported a $437 million net loss for the third quarter, which was deeper than analysts' expectations. This large loss, combined with the operating loss of $544 million, is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment[3][5].

2. **Missed Revenue Expectations**: Although net sales increased by 20% to $20.58 billion, this was still less than the analystsâ€™ expectations of $20.84 billion. This shortfall could contribute to short-term stock pressure[3][5].

3. **Challenges in International Segment**: The international segment operating loss was the lowest in years, and the growth rate was softer across several geographies. This weakness in international operations adds to the overall negative outlook[3].

4. **High Capital Expenditures**: Amazon's capital expenditures increased significantly due to investments in technology infrastructure and fulfillment operations. While these investments are for long-term growth, the immediate financial impact may concern investors in the short term[2][3].

5. **Guidance and Holiday Season**: The guidance for Q4 2014 includes a wide range of possible outcomes, but the operating income or loss is expected to be lower than the previous year, which could further dampen investor confidence. However, the company's preparations for the holiday season and new product launches might offer some positive offset[2][3].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the missed expectations, significant net loss, and ongoing investment costs.
