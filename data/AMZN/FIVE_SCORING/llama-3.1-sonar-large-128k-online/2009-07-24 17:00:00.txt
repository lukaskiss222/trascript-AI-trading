The Q2 2009 earnings transcript for Amazon.com indicates several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Amazon reported a 14% increase in worldwide revenue, a 17% increase in gross profit, and an 89% growth in trailing 12-month free cash flow. These metrics are generally positive and suggest healthy business growth[1.).

2. **Mixed Segment Performance**: While EGM (Electronics and General Merchandise) revenue saw significant growth, media revenue was flat due to declines in video games and consoles, offset by growth in books. This mixed performance could lead to some cautiousness among investors[1].

3. **Guidance and Expectations**: The Q3 guidance was provided with a range of $4.75 billion to $5.25 billion in net sales and GAAP operating income between $120 million and $210 million. This guidance, while reflecting some conservatism, is generally in line with expectations but does not indicate significant upside[1].

4. **Operational and Strategic Initiatives**: The acquisition of Zappos, growth in Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), and strong performance in Prime memberships are positive indicators of Amazon's strategic expansion and customer satisfaction efforts. However, the impact of these initiatives on short-term earnings may not be immediately significant[1].

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a neutral to slightly positive reaction in the short term. The strong financial performance and positive trends in key business segments are balanced by the mixed media sales and cautious guidance.
