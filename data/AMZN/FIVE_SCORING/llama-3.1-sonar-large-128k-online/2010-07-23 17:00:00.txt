Amazon's Q2 2010 earnings call highlighted several positive trends and some areas of caution, which could influence the stock's short-term performance.

### Positive Trends
- Amazon reported a 41% increase in worldwide revenue to $6.57 billion, exceeding expectations.
- Strong growth in EGM (Electronics and General Merchandise) revenue, up 69%, and a significant increase in Kindle device and content sales.
- Expansion of Fulfillment centers, both domestically and internationally, to support growing demand.
- Robust performance in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other revenue segments.
- Active customer accounts exceeded 118 million, and active seller accounts grew 19% to over 2 million.

### Areas of Caution
- The international operating margins were trending down due to the mix of lower gross margin categories and increased costs associated with new Fulfillment centers.
- Higher capital expenditures ($196 million in Q2) are expected to continue, which could impact short-term profitability.
- The tax rate was higher due to a one-time item related to a tentative agreement with Japanese and U.S. tax authorities.
- Guidance for Q3 includes a wide range for operating income, reflecting uncertainty around exchange rates and consumer spending.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive but muted reaction. The strong revenue growth, expanding customer base, and robust performance in key segments like Kindle and AWS are positive indicators. However, the increased costs, higher capital expenditures, and cautious guidance might temper immediate stock price gains.
