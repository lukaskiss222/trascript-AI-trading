Amazon reported robust growth in both sales and earnings, with a particular acceleration in unit growth, which is positive. However, concerns include high operational spending, potential challenges in maintaining gross margins due to new offerings like Kindle, lower ROIC, and greater investments in infrastructure. While the company's fundamentals suggest a positive outlook, the immediate short-term could see stock pressure due to the reduction in FCF and capital expenditure, which might prompt some investor caution.
