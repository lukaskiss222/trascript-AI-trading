Amazon's Q4 2008 earnings results show strong growth in revenue and cash flow despite the economic downturn, with particular success in the EGM segment and the Kindle initiative. However, the company provided conservative guidance for Q1 2009, indicating uncertainty due to economic conditions, which might temper investor enthusiasm in the short-term. Additionally, international growth and the potential in cloud computing services suggest long-term optimism, but immediate concerns over foreign exchange impacts and profitability challenges could weigh on the stock.
