Amazon.com, Inc., reported impressive first-quarter 2010 results, with revenue and earnings surpassing expectations. The company benefited from strong growth in media, EGM (Electronics and General Merchandise), and international segments, driven by effective customer-centric strategies like Prime membership and expanded selection. However, management discussed negative operating expense growth for Q2 and the potential need for capacity expansion, potentially hinting at short-term margin pressures. These mixed signals, along with a guidance that implies a sequential operating margin decline, could lead to a minor negative market reaction in the short term as investors weigh reaction in the short term.
