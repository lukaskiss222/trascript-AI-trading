Amazon's Q4 2006 results show a significant improvement in operating leverage, with North America revenue growth hitting a six-year high and good progress in the international segment. However, the gross margin has decreased due to product mix and price reductions, which might limit stock price enthusiasm in the short term despite solid top-line growth. Investors might react with caution due to the lower margins and the focus on longer-term investments in initiatives like Amazon Prime, Unbox, and web services, which haven't yet contributed significantly to the financials.
