Amazonâ€™s Q2 2009 earnings showcased resilience amid economic challenges with a 14% revenue increase, exceeding expectations, particularly in the high-growth Electronics and General Merchandise (EGM) segment. However, several factors suggest a cautious outlook for the immediate future despite the positive trends: (1) Mixed segment results with flat North American media sales due to industry slowdowns, (2) guidance that implies a below-average operating margin due to preparations for Q4, which might pressure the stock, and (3) uncertainties around foreign exchange rates, macro-economic conditions, and ongoing legal matters that could affect results. While long-term potential remains high due to strategic initiatives, short-term stock movement might experience some resistance due to these considerations.
