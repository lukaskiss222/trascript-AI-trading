Amazon's Q1 2006 earnings reveal several positive signals, yet the guidance for Q2 and the year suggests challenges. Revenue growth in North America (21%) and International (26% excluding FX impact) shows strong top-line performance. However, a notable decline in GAAP operating income guidance for Q2 (up to 69% decrease at the midpoint) indicates considerable short-term pressure from lower seasonal sales, lower product prices, and higher fixed costs. The focus on expanding Amazon Prime and other customer-focused expenditures are expected to pay dividends in the long term but could weigh on short-term profitability. The legal uncertainties around the Toys "R" Us termination add further risk to immediate stock price performance. 

Despite this, business model innovation and expanding product offerings through both retail and third-party sales channels signal Amazon's adaptability and potential for future growth, which might cushion any drastic negative reactions. Considering the balance of these short-term and long-term dynamics, the stock is likely to see a mild negative reaction in the next 1-2 weeks.
