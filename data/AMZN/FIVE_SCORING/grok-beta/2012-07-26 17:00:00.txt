Amazon's Q2 2012 results and forward guidance suggest a potentially volatile short-term movement. While the company posted strong revenue growth and operating income in North America, the significant decline in international segment operating income, negative impacts from foreign exchange rates, and integration costs from the Kiva Systems acquisition indicate short-term pressures. However, the focus on expanding 3P offerings, solid customer growth, and investment in fulfillment and technology infrastructure hint at long-term growth potential, though investors might react conservatively to the near-term guidance.
