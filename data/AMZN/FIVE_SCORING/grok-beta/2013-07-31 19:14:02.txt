Amazon's (Whole Foods) Q4 earnings were strong but the company's guidance for the next quarter implies a modest EPS growth and a significant increase in new store openings, likely leading to investors questioning short-term profitability and capital allocation efficiency. While the company's focus on value strategy and expanding market share is positive, investors might react negatively to the initial lower EPS growth projection and the costs associated with rapid expansion.
