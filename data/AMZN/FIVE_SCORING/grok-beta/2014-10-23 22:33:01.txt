The Q3 2014 earnings call for Amazon highlighted several significant aspects with mixed implications for the stock price. On the positive side, Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued to show strong growth, there was increased prime membership retention indicating customer loyalty, and the company's investment in new fulfillment centers is poised to enhance customer service. However, the call also brought forth concerns like a drop in media revenue, particularly due to a shift towards rentals over purchases, and significant losses related to inventory charges for the Fire Phone, which might dampen investor sentiment. Moreover, the management's conservative guidance, competitive pressures internationally, and high capital expenditures could weigh on the stock in the short term. Overall, these elements suggest a slightly negative outlook for Amazon's stock in the next 1-2 weeks.
