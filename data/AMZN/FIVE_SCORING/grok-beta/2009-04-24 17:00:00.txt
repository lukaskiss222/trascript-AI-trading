Amazon's Q1 2009 earnings call showcased a company making strides in a challenging economic environment. Notable highlights included 18% revenue growth, strong EGM performance, and an improving gross margin driven by inventory management efficiencies. However, concerns stem from a cautious Q2 guidance influenced by economic uncertainty, foreign exchange rates, and the previous year's high growth rates. While Amazon's operational improvements and cost-saving measures will likely mitigate some negative impact, the guidance suggests a mildly cautionary outlook, possibly resulting in a slight correction or reevaluation from investors in the short-term.
