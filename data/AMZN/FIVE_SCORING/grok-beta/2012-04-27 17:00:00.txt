Amazon.com's Q1 2012 earnings call painted a complex picture. The company delivered robust revenue growth, with a particular strength in e-commerce and AWS. However, operational costs increased significantly due to investments in fulfillment centers, AWS infrastructure, and digital content for Kindle. The guidance for Q2 was relatively conservative, especially on the segment operating income, suggesting pressure on profit margins. Therefore, despite strong top-line growth, the increased expenses and expected margin contraction might lead to investor concerns on profitability.
