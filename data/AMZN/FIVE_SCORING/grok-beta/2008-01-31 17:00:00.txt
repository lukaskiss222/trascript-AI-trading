Amazon's Q4 2007 financial results showed significant growth in both revenue and international segments, with a strong performance in various customer metrics like active accounts and seller units. Despite this, the forward-looking guidance for 2008 suggests a continued focus on price competitiveness, investments in new categories, amazon Prime, and infrastructure, which might limit short-term margin expansion. Management's emphasis on long-term cash flow growth over immediate profit margins indicates potential for a stock price rally due to positive growth prospects but may also experience some pressure due to near-term margin concerns.
