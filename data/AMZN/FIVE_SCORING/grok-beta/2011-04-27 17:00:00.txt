Amazon's Q1 2011 earnings call highlighted robust revenue growth of 38%, driven by the non-media segments, particularly EGM. However, the call also conveyed concerns on multiple fronts:

- **Increased Operating Expenses**: The text mentions that marketing, fulfillment, and technology costs increased as a percentage of sales, suggesting Amazon is ramping up spending to support growth. Such increases can put pressure on margins in the short term.

- **Japan's Impact**: The events in Japan negatively impacted Amazon's international segment, although the company predicted a rebound, the currency fluctuations and any ongoing disruption could affect short-term performance.

- **Decreased Operating Income**: Despite revenue growth, consolidated segment operating income and GAAP operating income decreased, hinting at challenges in profitability for the recent quarter.

- **Forward Guidance**: Amazon provided a nuanced Q2 guidance implying continued investment in capacity and technology to fuel growth, potentially at the cost of short-term profitability. This suggests management's belief in long-term potential but might raise short-term headwinds.

Given these points, the stock might see some volatility:

- **Possible Buy on the Rumor**: Investors expecting that Amazon will continue to innovate and expand might buy into the stock, anticipating that the investments will yield long-term benefits.

- **Potential Sell-off**: Conversely, the focus on capacity investments, increased costs, and weaker international income might raise concerns about near-term profitability and cause some investors to exit.

**Conclusion:** The nuanced guidance, detailed focus on long-term growth, and transparency around Capex and international challenges suggest that while Amazon expects continued growth, the market might take a more cautious view in the short term. The stock is likely to exhibit mild volatility due to these mixed signals.
