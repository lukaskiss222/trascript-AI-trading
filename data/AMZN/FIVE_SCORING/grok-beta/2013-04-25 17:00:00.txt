The Q1 2013 earnings call for Amazon shows a mixed bag for short-term stock impact. Revenue growth was strong at 22% year-over-year, and media and non-media (EGM) segments both saw healthy expansions. However, operating income fell, and there are concerns regarding foreign exchange impacts and significant capital expenditures affecting cash flow. Coupled with GAAP operating income decreasing from $130 million to $82 million, tempered guidance, and ongoing investment in infrastructure (like Amazon Web Services and additional fulfillment capacity), there's a potential for a short-term negative impact on stock price as the market digests the complex trade-offs between growth and profitability.
