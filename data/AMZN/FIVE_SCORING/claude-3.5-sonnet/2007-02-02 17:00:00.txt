Based on the detailed earnings transcript, Amazon showed strong performance with several positive indicators:

1. Revenue growth was robust at 34% to $3.99B, exceeding expectations
2. Active customer accounts increased 16% to over 64M
3. Strong performance in both media (25% growth) and EGM (55% growth) segments
4. Amazon Prime showing positive impact on customer spending and cross-shopping
5. Management expressed confidence in long-term operating margin potential

However, there were some concerns:
- Gross margins declined to lowest level in 5 years
- Heavy investments continuing in technology/content
- Operating leverage still not fully materializing

Despite these concerns, the overall tone was very positive with strong growth metrics and management's confident outlook regarding their investment strategy and long-term profit potential. The growth in active customers and success of Amazon Prime suggests strong fundamental momentum.
