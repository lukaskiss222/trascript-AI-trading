Based on this earnings transcript, Amazon demonstrated strong performance with several positive indicators despite some mixed signals. Key positives include:

1. Strong revenue growth of 22% to $15.7B (25% excluding FX)
2. Accelerating North America growth from 26% to 30%
3. Continued strong Prime membership growth and retention
4. Robust AWS growth, though specific numbers weren't disclosed
5. Healthy growth in key categories like apparel and consumables

Some concerns include international segment margins at zero and higher operating expenses, but these appear to be strategic investments rather than fundamental issues. Management's tone remained confident and focused on long-term growth opportunities.
