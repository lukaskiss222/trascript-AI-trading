Based on the earnings call transcript, Amazon demonstrated strong performance with several positive indicators:

1. Revenue grew 38% to $9.86B, significantly beating expectations
2. Unit growth accelerated to 51% (from 43% in Q4), driven by strong digital business growth
3. Active customer accounts exceeded 137M
4. Major infrastructure investments (fulfillment centers, AWS) to support continued growth
5. Management tone was confident and emphasized strong customer adoption across offerings

However, there are some minor concerns around margin pressure from investments and shipping costs. Despite these near-term cost pressures, the overall momentum in both physical and digital businesses, coupled with strategic investments in capacity, suggests the stock should react positively over the next 1-2 weeks.
