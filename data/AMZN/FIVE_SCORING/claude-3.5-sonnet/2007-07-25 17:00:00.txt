Based on the detailed earnings transcript, Amazon demonstrated strong performance in Q2 2007 with several positive indicators:

1. Revenue grew 35% to $2.89B with particularly strong North American growth of 38%
2. Operating income grew 149% to $116M
3. Strong growth in third-party sales and Amazon Prime adoption
4. Raised full-year guidance and showed margin expansion
5. Management expressed confidence in continued growth opportunities across retail and web services

The key factors suggest very strong near-term momentum, with accelerating growth rates, margin expansion, and raised guidance all being typically very positive catalysts for the stock price.

Taking into account the extremely positive results, strong guidance, and management's confident tone, this earnings report would likely drive significant positive stock movement in the 1-2 weeks following.
