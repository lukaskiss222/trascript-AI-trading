Based on the detailed Q3 2006 earnings call transcript, Amazon showed strong revenue growth of 24% and provided optimistic Q4 guidance of 22-33% growth. While operating income declined 28% due to continued investments in technology and fulfillment infrastructure, management expressed confidence in seeing improved operating leverage in Q4. Key positives include strong Amazon Prime adoption, expansion of selection across categories, and healthy international growth. The guidance and management's tone suggest they expect a strong holiday season.

The focus on long-term investments while maintaining revenue growth momentum, combined with positive Q4 outlook, likely indicates a positive short-term stock impact.
