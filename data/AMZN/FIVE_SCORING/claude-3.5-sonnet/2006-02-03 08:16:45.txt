Based on the detailed earnings transcript, here's my analysis of Amazon's Q4 2005 results and near-term outlook:

Key Positives:
- Strong revenue growth of 17% (22% excluding FX)
- Record free cash flow of $529M, up 11% YoY
- Healthy third-party seller growth at 28% of units
- Amazon Prime showing early traction with subscriptions doubling

Key Concerns:
- Operating margins declined 41 basis points to 6.7%
- Heavy investments in technology/content impacting profitability
- Conservative Q1 guidance suggesting slower growth
- Continued aggressive spending on Prime affecting margins

Near-term Outlook:
The company is in heavy investment mode across multiple initiatives (Prime, digital, international expansion) which will pressure margins in the short term. However, the core business fundamentals remain strong with healthy top-line growth and improving cash flows. Management's tone was cautiously optimistic while emphasizing long-term opportunities.

Given the mixed signals but overall solid fundamentals and Amazon's history of successful long-term investments, I expect a modestly positive stock reaction in the next 1-2 weeks.
