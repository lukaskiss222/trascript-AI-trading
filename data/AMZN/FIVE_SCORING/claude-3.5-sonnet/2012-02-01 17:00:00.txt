Based on the earnings call transcript, Amazon showed strong overall growth but with some concerning trends for the short term. While unit growth was impressive at 46% and third-party sales grew 65%, operating margins declined significantly and Q1 2012 guidance was relatively conservative with potential for an operating loss. The increased investments in fulfillment centers, headcount (up 67%), and digital content will continue to pressure margins in the near term. Additionally, some softness was noted in European markets and supply constraints from Thailand floods impacted certain categories.

While long-term investments appear sound, the combination of margin compression, conservative guidance, and increased spending points to likely near-term pressure on the stock.
