Based on Amazon's Q3 2010 earnings call, the company demonstrated exceptional performance with strong growth metrics across key areas:

Key Positives:
- Revenue grew 39% to $7.56B
- Worldwide unit growth of 41%
- Active customer accounts reached 121M
- Strong growth in both North America (45%) and International (32%) segments
- Robust EGM (electronics/general merchandise) growth at 68%
- Healthy cash position of $5.88B

While guidance suggests some margin pressure due to investments in fulfillment centers and infrastructure, the overall business momentum remains very strong. Management's focus on customer experience and long-term growth initiatives (Prime, Kindle, international expansion) suggests continued strength.
