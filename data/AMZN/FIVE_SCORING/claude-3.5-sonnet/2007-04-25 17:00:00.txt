Based on Amazon's Q1 2007 earnings call, several strong positive indicators emerge. The company reported impressive revenue growth of 32% to $3.02B, with both media and EGM segments showing robust performance. Key positive highlights include accelerating North American growth (30%), strong international performance (35% growth), improved operating margins, and increased guidance for the full year. Management's confident tone regarding Amazon Prime's success and web services potential further supports optimism. The company's strategic investments in fulfillment centers and technology appear to be paying off through improved efficiency and scale benefits.

The earnings represent a clear beat and raise quarter, with management raising both revenue and operating income guidance for the full year. This, combined with strong fundamental performance and positive forward-looking commentary, suggests the stock should see significant positive momentum in the near term.
