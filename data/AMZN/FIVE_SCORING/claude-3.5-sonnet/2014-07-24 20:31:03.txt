Based on the earnings call transcript, Amazon showed mixed signals with several key concerns:

1. AWS had significant price cuts (28-51%) impacting margins, though usage grew 90% YoY
2. Large investments in multiple areas (content, devices, international expansion) are pressuring near-term profitability, with Q3 guidance showing wider expected losses
3. However, Prime membership growth remained strong despite price increases, and gross margins hit record levels at 30.7%

The heavy investment cycle and lower AWS pricing will likely pressure the stock in the very near-term, despite solid underlying growth metrics. The Q3 guidance for wider losses will particularly concern investors, even though many investments appear strategically sound for the long-term.
