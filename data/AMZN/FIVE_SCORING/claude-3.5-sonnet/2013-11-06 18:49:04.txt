Based on the earnings transcript, Whole Foods shows mixed signals but with more concerning elements in the short term. Key negative points include lowered guidance for 2014, slowing comparable store sales growth (down to 5.9% from 7%), and multiple headwinds including increased competition, cannibalization effects, and macro-economic pressures. While there are some positives like continued expansion plans and strong gross margins, the company's conservative outlook revision and acknowledgment of multiple challenges suggest near-term stock pressure is likely.
