Based on the earnings transcript, Amazon demonstrated strong performance across multiple key metrics. Notable positives include:
- 14% revenue growth (20% excluding FX impact)
- 28% worldwide unit growth 
- Strong international growth (28% on local currency basis)
- Healthy Prime and FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) momentum
- Kindle sales exceeding expectations
- Strong third-party seller growth (30% of units, up YoY)
- Robust cash position ($3.21B)

While there were some minor concerns around media sales growth and margin guidance, the overall tone was very positive with broad-based strength across segments and geographies. The Zappos acquisition announcement also signals confidence in growth opportunities.

Given the strong execution, healthy growth metrics, and positive management commentary during a challenging economic period, the stock is likely to see a positive reaction in the near term.
