Based on Amazon's Q1 2013 earnings call, there are several positive indicators despite some mixed signals:

Key Positives:
- Strong revenue growth of 22% (24% excluding FX)
- Healthy unit growth of 30%
- Digital content growth accelerating, particularly in North America
- Prime membership showing good engagement and cross-shopping behavior

Some Concerns:
- International growth showing slight deceleration
- Operating margins compressed slightly
- Unit growth decelerated from previous quarters
- Conservative guidance for next quarter

Overall, while there are some moderate growth slowdowns, Amazon demonstrated strong fundamental performance and continued investment in key strategic areas like digital content, Prime, and international expansion. The management's tone remained confident and focused on long-term customer value creation. The short-term impact should be modestly positive.
