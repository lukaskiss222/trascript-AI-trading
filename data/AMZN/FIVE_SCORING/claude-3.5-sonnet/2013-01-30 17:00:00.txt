Based on Amazon's Q4 2012 earnings call, several positive indicators emerge. The company showed strong revenue growth of 22% to $21.27B, healthy paid unit growth of 32%, and expansion of third-party marketplace sales. Importantly, gross margins improved and fulfillment costs are becoming more efficient as the company optimizes its distribution network. While some investments continue to pressure near-term profits, the core retail business fundamentals appear solid with accelerating gross profit growth and improving operational leverage. Management's confident tone around Prime membership growth and AWS expansion suggests momentum heading into 2013.
