Based on the earnings call transcript, Amazon demonstrated strong performance with several positive indicators:

1. Prime membership grew 53% year-over-year indicating strong customer adoption
2. North America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02B
3. Fulfillment efficiency improved with controlled costs despite 20% unit growth
4. AWS continues strong growth with plans to break it out as separate segment
5. Gross margins improved driven by AWS and third-party marketplace growth

However, there are some mixed signals:

1. International segment operating income declined significantly
2. Q1 2015 guidance was relatively conservative
3. Foreign exchange headwinds impacting results
4. Heavy ongoing investments continuing in multiple areas

Overall, the results and commentary suggest solid execution and healthy core business momentum, particularly in North America and AWS, which should drive positive stock reaction in the near term.
