Based on the transcript, Amazon delivered a very strong quarter with significant positive indicators:

- 36% revenue growth to $12.95B, exceeding expectations
- 43% unit growth, highest in several years
- Strong performance in both North America (45% growth) and International (29% growth in local currency)
- Healthy growth across media and EGM segments
- Kindle seeing strong adoption with "millions" of devices sold
- Management expressing cautious optimism about continued growth
- Robust cash position of $8.76B

While there are some minor concerns around near-term margin pressure from investments in fulfillment centers and infrastructure, the overall tone is very positive with strong momentum across core businesses and new initiatives.
