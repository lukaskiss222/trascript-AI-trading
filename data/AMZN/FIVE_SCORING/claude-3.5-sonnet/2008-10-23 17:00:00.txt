Based on Amazon's Q3 2008 earnings call, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on the stock. Despite acknowledging some slowdown in growth at quarter-end, the company reported strong fundamentals with 31% revenue growth, expanding Kindle adoption, and healthy Prime membership growth of 70%. Management provided conservative but wide-ranging guidance reflecting macro uncertainty, while emphasizing their strong competitive positioning through low prices and free shipping. Most importantly, Amazon demonstrated it was well-prepared for the holiday season with new fulfillment centers and increased staffing.
