Based on Amazon's Q2 2012 earnings call, there are several key positive indicators for the short-term stock performance. Revenue growth remained strong at 29% (32% ex-FX), gross margins improved driven by third-party seller growth (40% of units vs 36% prior year), and management maintained an optimistic outlook on growth initiatives. However, significant investment spending in fulfillment centers, technology infrastructure, and international expansion is pressuring margins, with Q3 guidance indicating potential operating losses. The lower margin outlook and heavy investment cycle could create near-term headwinds despite solid top-line performance.
