Based on this extensive earnings call transcript, Amazon demonstrated very strong performance with several key positives:

1. Revenue grew 51% to $9.91B, significantly beating expectations
2. Paid unit growth accelerated to 56% from 45% in Q1
3. Strong performance across both media and EGM segments
4. Continued investment in growth initiatives (AWS, fulfillment centers, digital)
5. Healthy cash position of $6.36B

While margins compressed due to heavy investments, the company's aggressive growth stance and strong execution across core retail and newer initiatives like AWS suggest strong momentum. Management's confident tone and willingness to sacrifice near-term margins for long-term growth has historically proven successful for Amazon.

Given the strong fundamental performance and accelerating growth metrics, the stock is likely to see positive momentum in the following 1-2 weeks.
