Based on the earnings transcript, Amazon demonstrated exceptionally strong performance with several key positives:

1. Revenue grew 42% to $5.67B, significantly beating expectations
2. Free cash flow grew 143% to $1.18B
3. Active customer accounts grew 19% to 76M
4. Amazon Prime continues showing strong adoption and renewal rates
5. Management provided strong forward guidance for 2008 ($18.75B-$19.75B revenue)
6. The newly launched Kindle is seeing demand outpace expectations

The only minor concern is some pressure on margins due to competitive pricing and investments, but this appears strategic rather than problematic.

The earnings clearly demonstrate Amazon's strong execution and growing market position. The positive guidance and momentum across multiple business segments suggest the stock should see meaningful appreciation in the near term.
