Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of Amazon's likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Positives:
- Strong revenue growth of 23% YoY
- North America revenue growth steady at 26%
- AWS continues strong momentum despite price cuts
- Prime membership growth remains healthy post price increase
- Encouraging early Fire TV adoption

Key Concerns:
- International segment posted $60M operating loss vs $16M loss last year
- Q2 guidance suggests larger than usual sequential decline in operating income
- Deceleration in unit growth to 23% YoY
- Heavy ongoing investments impacting margins
- Operating margin compressed to 0.7%

While revenue growth remains robust and key initiatives like Prime and AWS show strength, the compressed margins and weak Q2 guidance point to near-term pressure on the stock. The market typically reacts negatively to Amazon's heavy investment cycles, even if they drive long-term value.

Rating: [-1] (Negative short-term impact expected)
