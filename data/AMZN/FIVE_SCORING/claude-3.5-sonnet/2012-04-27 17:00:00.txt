Based on the Q1 2012 earnings call, Amazon showed strong performance and positive momentum across multiple areas. Key positives include:

1. Strong revenue growth of 34% to $13.18B
2. Robust third-party seller growth over 60%
3. Improving gross margins 
4. Accelerating digital content sales from Kindle Fire
5. Healthy unit growth of 49%
6. Strong AWS growth

While there are some investment-related margin pressures, the core business fundamentals remain very strong with revenue growth and customer metrics trending positively. Management's tone was confident and they continue to invest aggressively for long-term growth. The improved margins and strong top-line momentum should drive positive sentiment in the near-term.
