Based on the earnings call transcript, Amazon's Q3 2014 results and Q4 guidance indicate concerning trends: Slowing revenue growth (20% vs higher historical rates), significant margin compression with operating losses, and conservative Q4 guidance below expectations. Key concerns include:

1. Large operating loss ($544M) and weak Q4 guidance
2. International growth slowdown (13% ex-FX)
3. $170M writedown on Fire Phone inventory
4. Rising fulfillment costs impacting margins
5. Conservative Q4 revenue guidance of 7-18% growth

However, there are some positive elements:
- AWS continues strong growth (~90% usage growth)
- Prime membership remains healthy
- Investment in strategic growth areas (fulfillment, content)

Given the significant earnings miss, weak margins, and conservative guidance going into the critical holiday season, the stock is likely to face meaningful near-term pressure.
