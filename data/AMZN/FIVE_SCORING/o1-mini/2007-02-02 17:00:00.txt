Amazon reported strong revenue growth of 34% year-over-year and increased active customer accounts, indicating robust demand and market expansion. Despite declining gross margins due to strategic investments in technology and competitive pricing, the positive guidance for Q1 and ongoing growth initiatives like Amazon Prime and Web Services suggest confidence in continued performance. These factors are likely to support a positive short-term reaction in the stock.
