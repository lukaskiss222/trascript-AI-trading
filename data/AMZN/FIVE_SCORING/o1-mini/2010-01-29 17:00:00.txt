Amazon reported strong revenue and profit growth across both North American and international segments, driven by significant increases in media and EGM revenues. The company's focus on expanding its Prime membership, improving inventory management, and strategic investments in Kindle and other services indicate solid short-term momentum. Positive guidance for Q1 further supports a bullish outlook for the stock in the next couple of weeks.
