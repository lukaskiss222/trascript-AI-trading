Based on the transcript, Amazon's Q3 2010 earnings call revealed strong revenue and unit growth, but also highlighted some challenges. The company saw a 20% decline in international gross margins and a 63% increase in marketing costs, which could be attributed to new category launches and increased spending on customer acquisition. Additionally, the company's guidance for Q4 was slightly lower than expected, which could potentially impact the stock price in the short term. However, the company's strong unit growth and continued expansion in international markets suggest long-term potential.
