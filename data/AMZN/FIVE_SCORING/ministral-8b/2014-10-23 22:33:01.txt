### Analysis:
The earnings call for Amazon.com, Inc. reveals mixed signals regarding the company's performance and future prospects. While Amazon achieved record sales and expanded its fulfillment centers, the company faced challenges such as slower media growth due to shifts from physical to digital media and increased competition. The guidance for Q4 2014 was conservative, with net sales expected to grow between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion, which was below expectations. Additionally, the company highlighted the impact of the Fire phone on its financial results and the potential for increased competition in international markets. Despite these challenges, Amazon remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects and continues to invest in new opportunities.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on Amazon's stock price is likely to be negative due to the conservative guidance and the challenges highlighted during the earnings call. The company's stock may face downward pressure due to the slower growth rates and increased competition. However, the long-term prospects remain strong, and the stock may rebound as investors focus on the company's growth opportunities and long-term strategy.
