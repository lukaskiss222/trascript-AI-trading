**Analysis:**

The Q4 and full-year earnings call for Amazon.com, Inc. revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported strong revenue growth, driven by Prime membership, FBA, and AWS, but also highlighted challenges such as negative incremental margins, FX headwinds, and the impact of the leap year. Management's tone was optimistic about the future, emphasizing growth in international markets, particularly India and China, and the potential of new services like Echo and Alexa. However, concerns were raised about the cost of video content and the potential impact of regulatory changes like border taxes. Overall, the call provided a balanced view of Amazon's performance and future prospects.

**Conclusion:**

Given the mixed signals, the short-term impact on Amazon's stock price is expected to be neutral. The company's strong revenue growth and optimistic outlook for international markets should provide some support, but concerns about negative margins and regulatory risks may temper any immediate upside. The stock is likely to remain volatile in the short term.
