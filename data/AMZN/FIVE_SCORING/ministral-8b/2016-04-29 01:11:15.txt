The earnings call from Amazon.com, Inc. reveals strong growth across multiple segments, particularly in the international market and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company reported a 28% increase in worldwide revenue and a 64% growth in AWS revenue. The international segment also showed robust growth, with a 26% FX-neutral revenue increase. The company's guidance for the second quarter remains positive, projecting sales between $28 billion and $30.5 billion.

However, there are some concerns:
- The company's active customer account growth slowed down, which could indicate saturation in certain markets.
- The AWS margin may be affected by seasonality and cost efficiency, which could lead to some volatility in the coming quarters.
- The company's gross margin is influenced by third-party contributions and content costs, which could impact future performance.

Overall, the earnings call provides a mixed picture for Amazon, with strong growth in certain segments and some potential headwinds. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the slowing active customer account growth and potential volatility in AWS margins. However, the long-term prospects remain positive, driven by the company's strong growth trajectory and strategic investments in international markets and AWS.
