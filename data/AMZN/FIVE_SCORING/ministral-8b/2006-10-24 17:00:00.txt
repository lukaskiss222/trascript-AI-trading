Based on the earnings transcript, Amazon.com, Inc. reported strong revenue growth of 24% in Q3 2006, driven primarily by increased selection and lower prices. However, the company also experienced a decline in free cash flow due to increased technology and content spending. The guidance for Q4 2006 was slightly lower than expected, with net sales projected to grow between 22% and 33%, and GAAP operating income expected to decline by 12% to 43%. The company's focus on expanding selection and improving customer experience is likely to continue, but the increased spending on technology and content may lead to a temporary decline in profitability.
