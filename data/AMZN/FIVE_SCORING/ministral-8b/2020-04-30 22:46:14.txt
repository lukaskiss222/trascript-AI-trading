### Analysis

The earnings call for Amazon.com, Inc. revealed several key points that will impact the stock price in the short term. The company experienced a significant surge in demand for essential products, leading to increased costs related to safety measures, employee wages, and other COVID-19 related expenses. While the company expects these costs to be substantial in Q2, they also noted that the incremental revenue from essential products is coming at cost. This suggests that while Amazon is seeing increased sales, the profit margins may be squeezed.

The management highlighted the challenges in logistics and supply chain, particularly with the need to prioritize essential items and the increased demand for non-essential items. This has led to a temporary reduction in fulfillment efficiency, with one-day shipping costs remaining high. The call also mentioned the need to expand capacity and resume more normal operations, which will take time.

On the AWS side, the company reported a healthy adoption of its cloud services, with a continued increase in backlog and usage. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AWS is not as clear, with the company noting that different industries are seeing different levels of demand.

The company also mentioned potential long-term changes in consumer behavior, with increased adoption of Prime services and digital offerings. However, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be more focused on the immediate challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the company's ability to manage its costs and logistics.

### Conclusion

Given the significant costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges in logistics and supply chain, the short-term outlook for Amazon's stock price is likely to be negative. The company's ability to manage these challenges and return to more normal operations will be key to determining the stock's performance in the coming weeks.
