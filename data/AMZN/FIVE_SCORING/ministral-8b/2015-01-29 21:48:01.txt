Based on the earnings transcript, Amazon.com reported strong performance in Q4 2014, with revenue growth of 15% and a 20% increase in year-over-year net sales. However, the company's guidance for Q1 2015 was less optimistic, with net sales expected to grow between 6% and 16%, and GAAP operating income or loss expected to be between $450 million loss and $50 million in income. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
