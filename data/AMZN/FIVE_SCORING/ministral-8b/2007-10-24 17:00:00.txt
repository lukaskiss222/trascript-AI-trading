The earnings call for Amazon.com, Inc. reveals strong financial performance with a 41% increase in worldwide revenue to $3.26 billion, driven by significant growth in the EGM and media segments. The company also highlights the success of Amazon Prime, with more than doubling in memberships year over year. Despite these positive signs, the stock may face short-term pressure due to the one-time impact of Harry Potter sales on gross margins and the uncertainty around international expansion plans. The company's guidance for Q4 2007 projects net sales of between $5.1 billion and $5.45 billion, with GAAP operating income expected to be between $221 million and $291 million. Overall, the earnings call provides a mixed signal, suggesting both potential for growth and challenges in the near term.
