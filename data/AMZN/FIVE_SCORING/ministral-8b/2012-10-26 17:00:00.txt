Based on the earnings call transcript for Amazon.com, Inc., the company reported mixed results with notable growth in revenue and paid units, but also faced challenges with international margins and fulfillment costs. The guidance for Q4 2012 was positive, with expected net sales growth between 16% and 31%, but the operating margin was expected to be negative. Management expressed confidence in their strategy and investments in fulfillment capacity and new geographies, with a focus on improving customer experience and driving long-term growth. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around international margins and fulfillment costs, but long-term investors may be encouraged by the company's strategic investments and growth prospects.
