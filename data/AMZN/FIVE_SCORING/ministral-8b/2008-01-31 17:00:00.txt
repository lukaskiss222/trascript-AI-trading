### Analysis:
Amazon.com reported strong Q4 and full-year 2007 results with revenue growth of 39% and a significant increase in free cash flow. The company's guidance for 2008 projects a range of $18.75 billion to $19.75 billion in net sales, a growth of 26% to 33%. Despite this growth, the company expects a flat margin year-over-year, driven by increased customer spending and a focus on improving the customer experience. The company is also investing in new categories and expanding its fulfillment capabilities.

### Conclusion:
The short-term implications for Amazon.com's stock are likely to be positive due to the strong revenue growth and the company's continued focus on improving customer experience and expanding its offerings. However, the flat margin guidance may cause some concern among investors. Overall, the company's strategy of investing in growth and improving its customer experience should drive long-term success, but the short-term impact on the stock may be mixed due to the margin guidance.
