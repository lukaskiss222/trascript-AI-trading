Based on the earnings transcript, Amazon.com, Inc. reported strong Q3 2009 results, with revenue growth of 28% and a significant increase in free cash flow. However, the guidance for Q4 was cautious, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and consumer spending. The company's focus on improving customer experience, expanding selection, and maintaining low prices is likely to continue, which could impact its stock price in the short term. Additionally, the company's focus on strategic growth and cost-saving measures could lead to further stock price volatility.
