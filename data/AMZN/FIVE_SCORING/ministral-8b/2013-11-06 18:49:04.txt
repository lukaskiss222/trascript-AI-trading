### Analysis:

Whole Foods Market reported strong Q4 and full-year results, with record sales and impressive gross margins. However, the company faced some headwinds, including price investments, cannibalization, and macroeconomic factors. The revised guidance for FY 2014 reflects a more conservative outlook due to these factors. The management team's strategic approach to price investments and cost control, along with their commitment to new store openings and innovation, indicates a solid long-term plan. The stock may experience short-term volatility as investors digest the mixed signals and the revised guidance.

### Conclusion:

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the revised guidance and the temporary impact of price investments and cannibalization. However, the company's long-term growth prospects and strategic initiatives could lead to a recovery in the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
