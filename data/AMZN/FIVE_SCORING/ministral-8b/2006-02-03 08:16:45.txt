### Analysis
Amazon.com's Q4 and full-year 2005 earnings call revealed strong performance with record sales and free cash flow growth. The company's focus on customer experience and investments in technology and content led to robust results. However, the guidance for 2006 suggested a challenging environment due to foreign exchange fluctuations and potential economic slowdowns. The company's continued investment in digital and international expansion, despite lower margins, indicates long-term growth potential. The stock market reaction is likely to be mixed, with investors focusing on both the positive growth outlook and the challenges ahead.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience short-term volatility due to the mixed guidance and ongoing challenges in the international market. However, the long-term potential of Amazon's growth strategy and its focus on customer experience are likely to provide support for the stock in the long run. Given the current market conditions and the company's strategic direction, the stock is likely to be neutral in the short term.
