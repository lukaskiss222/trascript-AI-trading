Based on the earnings call transcript, the short-term impact on Amazon.com's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks is likely to be neutral. The company reported strong revenue growth and maintained its guidance for the second quarter, but also highlighted significant cost pressures due to inflation and labor issues. The market has been anticipating these challenges, so there may not be a substantial reaction in the short term. However, the potential for further cost increases and the ongoing uncertainty around inflation could lead to some volatility in the stock price.
