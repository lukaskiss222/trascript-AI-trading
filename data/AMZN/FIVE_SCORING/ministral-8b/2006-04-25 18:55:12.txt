**Analysis:**

The earnings call provided a mix of positive and cautious signals. Amazon's Q1 results showed strong growth, particularly in its North American and International segments, with revenue growing by 20% and worldwide unit growth by 24%. Key highlights included the launch of new services and features, such as Amazon Prime, Amazon S3, and the Advantage program, which are driving customer engagement and growth.

However, the call also highlighted several concerns and uncertainties. The ongoing litigation with Toys "R" Us and the potential impact on operating profit if the company loses the case was a significant risk factor. Additionally, the company's guidance for Q2 and full-year 2006 was tempered by a high level of uncertainty surrounding foreign exchange rates and the global economy.

**Conclusion:**

Given the mixed signals and the high level of uncertainty surrounding the company's guidance and the Toys "R" Us litigation, the short-term impact on Amazon's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The stock may face some pressure in the coming weeks due to the uncertainty surrounding the company's guidance and the potential impact of the Toys "R" Us litigation.

**Rating:** 0
