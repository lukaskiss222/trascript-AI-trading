### Short-Term Impact Analysis

**Reasoning:**
The Amazon.com earnings call for Q2 2012 revealed a mixed performance with a significant drop in operating income and net income, largely due to the integration costs of the Kiva Systems acquisition and increased capital expenditures. The company reported a 47% decrease in GAAP operating income to $107 million, which was significantly lower than the $79 million from the previous year. Additionally, the company's guidance for Q3 2012 showed a projected decline in operating income, indicating that the company expects continued pressure on profitability. Despite these challenges, the company highlighted strong growth in international markets and the continued expansion of its fulfillment centers, which are expected to drive future growth.

**Conclusion:**
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the significant drop in operating income and the guidance for a decline in operating income for Q3. However, the long-term outlook remains positive given the company's strong growth in international markets and its ongoing investments in infrastructure and technology.
