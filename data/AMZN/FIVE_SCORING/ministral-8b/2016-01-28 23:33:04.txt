### Analysis

However, there were some mixed signals, such as a slight deceleration in North America EGM growth and higher fulfillment costs due to increased FBA usage. The company's guidance for Q1 2016 was in line with expectations, with net sales projected to grow by 17% to 28% and GAAP operating income expected to be between $100 million and $700 million. The management's focus on cost efficiencies and customer experience was evident, as they continue to invest heavily in growth areas while maintaining a balance between top-line growth and profitability.
