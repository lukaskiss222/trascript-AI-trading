The company's AWS segment continued to perform well, with a significant increase in revenue and a strong customer base. The company also saw growth in its advertising business and third-party seller services, with a strong holiday season performance. The company's guidance for 2020 was also positive, with expectations for continued growth in AWS and advertising.
