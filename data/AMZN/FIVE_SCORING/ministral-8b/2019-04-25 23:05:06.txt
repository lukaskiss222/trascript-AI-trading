### Analysis

The earnings call for Amazon.com, Inc. in Q1 2019 revealed several key points that could impact the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks. The company highlighted significant growth in AWS, which is a major revenue driver, and provided reassurance about the Prime membership program's stickiness. However, there were concerns about the deceleration in third-party seller services and the potential slowdown in advertising revenue. Additionally, the company announced a significant investment in one-day shipping, which could have both positive and negative implications depending on its success and cost efficiency.

### Conclusion

The call provides a mixed outlook. While AWS continues to perform strongly and Prime membership growth is robust, the deceleration in third-party seller services and potential slowdown in advertising revenue could weigh on the stock. The significant investment in one-day shipping is a strategic move that could drive future growth but also carries high costs. Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience short-term volatility but may ultimately benefit from the long-term strategic initiatives.
