The earnings call for Amazon.com, Inc. reveals several key points that will likely impact the stock price in the short term (1â€“2 weeks). The company reported strong Q1 results, driven by robust growth in North America, particularly in the Prime program and AWS. However, the company also announced a price increase for Prime membership, which could potentially dampen short-term growth. Additionally, the company's international expansion and investment in logistics are expected to continue, which may have a positive long-term impact but could also be seen as a costly investment in the near term. Overall, the company's strong performance and continued growth prospects should provide a positive outlook for the stock, despite the price increase for Prime membership.
