### Analysis:
The earnings call for Amazon.com, Inc. revealed strong growth in Q2 2011, with revenue growing by 51% to $9.91 billion. Despite the growth, there were notable challenges such as an 8% decrease in free cash flow and a 25% decrease in GAAP operating income. The company's guidance for Q3 2011 also indicated a potential slowdown in operating income, which could impact margins. Additionally, the company's investments in AWS and other digital initiatives, while promising, are expected to require significant capital expenditure in the near term. These factors, combined with the uncertainty around the sales tax issue and the potential impact of the federal solution, suggest a mixed outlook for the stock.

### Conclusion:
The short-term implications for Amazon's stock price are likely to be neutral, given the mixed signals from the earnings call. While the strong revenue growth is positive, the decrease in free cash flow and the potential slowdown in operating income could cause some concern among investors. The uncertainty around the sales tax issue and the impact of the federal solution adds to the overall uncertainty. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a neutral impact in the next 1-2 weeks.
