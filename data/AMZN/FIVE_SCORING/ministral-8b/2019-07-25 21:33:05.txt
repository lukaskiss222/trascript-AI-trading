**Analysis:**
- The earnings call highlighted strong growth in AWS, with a 37% year-over-year increase in run rate to $33 billion, driven by increased adoption of machine learning services and enterprise migrations.
- The rollout of one-day shipping has shown strong customer response, with a meaningful step up in one-day shipments, particularly in North America. This has contributed to revenue growth acceleration in Q2.
- Management is confident in handling seasonal demand for the holiday period and expects continued ramp-up of one-day shipping capacity.
- The company is investing heavily in AWS, devices, video, and international expansion, which will contribute to higher expenses in the coming quarters.
- The acquisition of Sizmek is seen as a long-term investment to serve advertisers and complement Amazon's advertising business.

**Conclusion:**
Given the strong performance in AWS and the positive customer response to one-day shipping, along with the company's continued investment in growth areas, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term. However, the increased expenses related to one-day shipping and other investments may put pressure on operating income in the coming quarters.

**Rating:** 1
