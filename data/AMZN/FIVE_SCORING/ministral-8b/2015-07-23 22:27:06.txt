Based on the earnings transcript for Amazon.com, Inc., the company reported strong financial results for Q2 2015, with significant growth in revenue, operating income, and free cash flow. The key drivers of this growth include the continued success of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the expansion of Prime membership, and the acceleration of international retail sales. The company also highlighted its operational efficiency gains and the potential for future growth in both AWS and international markets.

However, there were some concerns raised during the call, such as the high capital intensity of AWS and the need to maintain pricing strength without compromising margins. Additionally, the company's aggressive investment strategy and the potential impact of foreign exchange fluctuations were noted.

Overall, the earnings call provided a positive outlook for Amazon's future growth prospects, but there are some risks and uncertainties to consider. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the high capital intensity of AWS and the need to maintain pricing strength, but the long-term potential for growth in both AWS and international markets remains strong.
