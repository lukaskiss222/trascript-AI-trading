Amazon's Q4 2009 earnings call signals strong financial performance and continued growth, with significant increases in revenue, free cash flow, and return on invested capital.  Management emphasizes a focus on customer experience and low prices, projecting continued growth in Q1 despite acknowledging global economic uncertainties.  The adoption of new revenue recognition standards for Kindle will impact Q1 results, but the overall guidance suggests a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
