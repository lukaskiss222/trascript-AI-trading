Amazon's Q3 2010 earnings show strong revenue growth across all segments, driven by EGM (especially).  Management highlighted significant investments in fulfillment and technology, and while this creates positive long-term potential, it is likely the primary driver of increased operating expenses.  This is reflected in the guidance for Q4,  which projects a decline in operating income despite overall sales growth, indicating short-term pressure potentially stemming from these investments.
