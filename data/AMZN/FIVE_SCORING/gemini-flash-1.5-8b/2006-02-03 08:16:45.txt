Amazon's earnings call highlights strong revenue growth (23% YoY) and record free cash flow, driven by significant expansion in the marketplace (third-party sales) and a robust international presence.  Management emphasizes continued investment in technology, especially in areas like web services and content, and expects continued growth, while also acknowledging potential headwinds from foreign exchange fluctuations.  This suggests a short-term neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price, underpinned by strong performance but tempered by the need for continued investment and uncertainty surrounding exchange rates.
