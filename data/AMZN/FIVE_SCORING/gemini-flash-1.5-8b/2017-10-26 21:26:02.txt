Amazon's Q3 2017 earnings call indicates strong performance exceeding expectations, primarily driven by record Prime Day sign-ups, robust AWS growth, and increased international retail sales.  Management highlighted the successful integration of Whole Foods and the positive impact on physical store revenue.  This suggests a positive trend for the stock over the next few weeks, likely resulting in a rally.
