Amazon's Q3 2009 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth, particularly in media and EGM segments, driven by low prices, expanded selection, and the success of Amazon Prime.  Management emphasized operational efficiencies in fulfillment, leading to cost reductions, and maintained a focus on delivering a positive customer experience.  Guidance for Q4 indicates continued strong growth, but also acknowledges substantial external uncertainty.
