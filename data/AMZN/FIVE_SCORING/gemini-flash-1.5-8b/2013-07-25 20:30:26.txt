Amazon's Q2 2013 earnings call highlighted strong growth in e-commerce sales, particularly in North America.  However, the international segment showed softer growth, with declining international media revenue and zero operating income.  The company's focus on expansion, investment in infrastructure, and customer experience through Prime and same-day delivery suggests a continued commitment to growth. This, coupled with the potential for Amazon to further capture market share via strategic initiatives, sets up the potential for a mid-term positive impact on the stock if the company can achieve profitability in the coming quarters.
