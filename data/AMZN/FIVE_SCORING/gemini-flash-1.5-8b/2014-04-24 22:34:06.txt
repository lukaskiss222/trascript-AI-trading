Amazon's Q1 2014 earnings call showed strong revenue growth (23%) driven by acceleration in both North America and International segments, with robust performance in AWS and e-commerce sales.  Management highlighted continued investment in technology and infrastructure, and expressed optimism about Prime membership growth post-price increase.  The call suggests a healthy short-term outlook with strong fundamentals, potentially offset by continued investment in international expansion.
