Amazon's Q2 2020 earnings call highlighted significant short-term impacts of the pandemic, primarily increased customer demand and related costs.  The company exceeded guidance, but emphasized ongoing investments in employee safety and capacity expansion to meet surging demand.  The call suggests a likely continued positive impact on the stock price in the next two weeks, as investors will likely focus on the company's exceeding guidance despite elevated costs and capacity concerns.
