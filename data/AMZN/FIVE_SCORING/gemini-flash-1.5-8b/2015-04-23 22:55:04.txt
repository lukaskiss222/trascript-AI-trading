Amazon's Q1 2015 earnings call highlighted strong performance, particularly in AWS and North America, with significant investment in Prime and fulfillment.  Guidance for Q2 was a bit lower than anticipated, but management emphasized continued investment in key initiatives and a long-term view.  Therefore, even with lower guidance, the stock likely to see positive movement due to strong Q1 results and confidence expressed by management.
