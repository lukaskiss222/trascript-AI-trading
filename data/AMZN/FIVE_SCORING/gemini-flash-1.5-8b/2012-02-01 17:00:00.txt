Amazon's Q4 2011 earnings show strong unit growth, particularly in Kindle devices and third-party sales.  However, operating margins declined, reflecting increased operating expenses, and the guidance for Q1 2012 anticipates a significant decrease in operating income.  Management's optimistic tone about future growth suggests a willingness to invest heavily, but the short-term impact on the stock is likely negative due to the tempered guidance and ongoing investment pressures.
