Amazon's Q1 2009 earnings call highlights strong growth in key segments, particularly EGM, with a significant increase in active customer and seller counts.  Management's guidance for Q2 projects slightly lower growth compared to Q1, citing factors like overlapping with Amazon's strongest prior quarter, Easter effects, and significant FX headwinds. The call emphasizes continued focus on improving customer experience and driving efficiency across operations and suggests that despite a global economic slowdown concerns, Amazon is navigating the environment effectively, maintaining a focus on growth.
