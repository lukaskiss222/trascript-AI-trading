Amazon's Q3 2014 earnings call indicates continued robust growth, particularly in e-commerce, but with some operational challenges.  While revenue and active customer accounts are strong, management highlights continued investment in infrastructure and international expansion, which currently lead to a consolidated segment operating loss.  The guidance for Q4 2014 suggests a moderate revenue increase, but with an operating loss. This, paired with a wide range of projections in the face of strong Q3 2013, points to a cautious outlook that may not translate into a significant short-term price impact.
