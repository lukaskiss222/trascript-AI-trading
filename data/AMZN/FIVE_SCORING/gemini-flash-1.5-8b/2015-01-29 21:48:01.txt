Amazon's Q4 2014 earnings call highlights strong revenue growth, particularly in the e-commerce segment (EGM).  However, the international segment showed weaker operating income compared to North America, primarily due to slower growth and investments in expanding fulfillment capacity worldwide.  Management emphasized continued investment in AWS and fulfillment infrastructure and noted a shift toward more "convenience" over "price."  This suggests a potential short-term cautious outlook as the company navigates these investments, while the overall growth potential remains high.
