Amazon's Q1 2007 earnings call showed strong revenue growth across all segments, driven by media and EGM, and notable improvements in operating income.  Management projects continued growth in the coming quarters,  with a focus on international expansion and diversification of product offerings. While some margin pressure from promotional offers is acknowledged,  improved cost efficiency and a third-party mix are anticipated to offset this, suggesting a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
