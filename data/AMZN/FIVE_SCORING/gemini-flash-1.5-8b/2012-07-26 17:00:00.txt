Amazon's Q2 2012 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, driven by expansion in e-commerce and, particularly, fulfillment business growth (e.g., new fulfillment centers).  However, operating income and free cash flow showed significant drops and negative guidance for Q3, largely due to substantial investments in technology, infrastructure, and fulfillment capacity to support growth and meet the anticipated seasonal demand. The call highlights an emphasis on long-term growth over short-term profitability which is indicated by the negative guidance that the company is likely to face in the coming weeks.
