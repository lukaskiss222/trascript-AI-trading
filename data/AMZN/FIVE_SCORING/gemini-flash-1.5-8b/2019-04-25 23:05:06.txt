Amazon's Q1 2019 earnings call highlighted a strategic shift towards one-day shipping, with substantial investment planned for Q2.  Management cited increasing customer demand for faster delivery and the potential for this to attract and retain users.  While unit growth was lower than expected, the company emphasized efficiency gains and the continued strength of other segments like AWS, suggesting the impact on the stock will be fairly neutral in the short term due to this investment.
