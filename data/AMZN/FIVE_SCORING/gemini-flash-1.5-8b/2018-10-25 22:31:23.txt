Amazon's Q3 2018 earnings call revealed a deceleration in online store unit growth, primarily due to shifting digital content consumption patterns towards subscriptions (like Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited).  Management emphasized continued strong demand, highlighting growth in Amazon-fulfilled units versus paid units, and positive holiday season preparations.  While there are some headwinds with changing revenue recognition and international sales, the positive tone, strong AWS and advertising performance, and focus on operational efficiencies suggest a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact on the stock.
