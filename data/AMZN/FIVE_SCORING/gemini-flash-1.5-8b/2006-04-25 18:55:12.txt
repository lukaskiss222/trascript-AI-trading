Amazon's Q1 2006 earnings call highlights strong revenue growth (20% overall) and healthy free cash flow.  Management emphasizes continued focus on customer experience improvements (Amazon Prime) and expansion into new product categories.  However, the call also notes challenges with foreign exchange and the Toys "R" Us contract litigation, both of which could negatively impact their profit margins and therefore their stock price in the short-term.
