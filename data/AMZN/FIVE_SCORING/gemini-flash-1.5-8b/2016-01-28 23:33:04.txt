Amazon's Q4 2015 earnings call highlighted strong financial performance, with record revenue growth and substantial increases in free cash flow.  Management's commentary emphasized the importance of continued investment in infrastructure and fulfillment capacity, particularly to support AWS and FBA growth.  While guidance for Q1 2016 suggests a potential deceleration in growth, the overall positive financial picture and management's confidence imply a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
