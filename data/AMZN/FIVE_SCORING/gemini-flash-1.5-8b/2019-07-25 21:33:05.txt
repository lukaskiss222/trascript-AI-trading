Amazon's Q2 2019 earnings call highlighted significant growth in one-day shipping, which is driving retail sales acceleration, primarily in North America.  Management is confident in their ability to handle increased holiday demand, but acknowledges that ramping up one-day shipping capacity across all regions and handling higher volumes presents a short-term cost challenge.  The call also suggests continued investments in AWS and other high-growth areas, indicating continued expansion, with potential pressures on the operating margin in the short term.
