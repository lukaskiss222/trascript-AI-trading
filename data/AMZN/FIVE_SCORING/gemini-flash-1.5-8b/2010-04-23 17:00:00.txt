Amazon's Q1 2010 earnings call highlights substantial growth across all segments, including strong unit growth, active customer accounts surpassing 114 million (including China), and robust operating income.  Management projects continued strong growth in Q2, with guidance suggesting substantial operating income expansion. Favorable foreign exchange also contributes to a positive outlook. The call suggests Amazon is well-positioned for continued expansion and market leadership, despite a shift towards agency pricing for e-books.
