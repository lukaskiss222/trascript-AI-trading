Amazon's Q1 2007 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth across segments, with international markets showing significant potential despite slower EGM growth. The company's increased guidance for GAAP operating income and operating margins, alongside robust North American performance, suggests positive short-term investor sentiment. The planned stock repurchase and strategic expansion of both product categories and fulfillment capacity indicate confidence in sustaining growth, likely driving a positive impact on the stock over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
