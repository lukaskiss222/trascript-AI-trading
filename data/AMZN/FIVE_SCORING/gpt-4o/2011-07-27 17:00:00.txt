Amazon's Q2 2011 earnings call presents a complex picture. The company reported strong revenue growth of 51% year-over-year, primarily due to its robust retail and expanding digital segments, including Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, the decreased operating income and free cash flow reflect heavy reinvestment in expansion and infrastructure, which could concern short-term investors. Despite the impressive top-line growth, the weaker margins and lowered Q3 guidance might lead to a cautious short-term market reaction. The stock is likely to face modest pressure in the short term as the market digests these mixed results.
