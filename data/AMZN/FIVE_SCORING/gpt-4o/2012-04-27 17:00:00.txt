Amazon's Q1 2012 earnings call highlights a robust revenue growth of 34%, but with a notable decline in operating margins, particularly internationally. Despite impressive sales increases, especially in media and electronics, concerns over cost pressures from investments in fulfillment centers and technology infrastructure persist. Management offered broad Q2 guidance, indicating potential for slight operating income decline, reflecting ongoing investment strategies. While positive customer metrics and service growth were emphasized, the cautious outlook on margins could dampen short-term stock performance.
