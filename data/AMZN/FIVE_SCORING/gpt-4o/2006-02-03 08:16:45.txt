Amazon's fourth-quarter 2005 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth of 17% year-over-year and improvements in several key financial metrics, including gross profit and margin expansion. The company's substantial investments in growth initiatives, such as Amazon Prime, and technology were highlighted as long-term revenue drivers despite a short-term pressure on operating margins. Management's guidance indicates anticipated deceleration in operating income, partly due to continued investments and adverse foreign exchange impacts. While there are some concerns about market share and competitive pressures, the overall strong performance and strategic focus on growth suggest a modest positive impact on the stock in the short term.
