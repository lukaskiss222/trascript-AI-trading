Amazon's Q3 2021 transcript reveals several insights with possible short-term implications for the stock. Noteworthy is Amazon's strong revenue growth and expansion, underpinned by AWS and advertising. However, significant cost pressures due to labor and supply chain challenges are anticipated to continue into Q4, suggesting margin tightness in the short term. While Amazon's foundational strengths like AWS and advertising remain robust, the expected increase in operating costs might weigh on investor sentiment in the very near term. As such, this might lead to a modest negative impact on the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
