Amazon's Q4 2012 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth of 22%, with increased media and electronics sales. While there was a decrease in free cash flow and a significant drop in operating income for the international segment, the overall financial results showed resilience. Timely expansion of the fulfillment network and a shift towards third-party sales indicate operational improvements. Despite some pressures, such as declined profit margins internationally and investment in infrastructure, the strong revenue performance and ongoing customer-centric strategies suggest a short-term positive sentiment for the stock.
