Amazon's Q3 2012 results show strong revenue growth of 27% year-over-year, highlighting resilience in a challenging economic environment. However, the company reported a GAAP operating loss due to heavy investments in infrastructure and global expansion, particularly in fulfillment and digital content. Management's continued focus on strategic investments to enhance customer experience, coupled with guidance indicating potential operating losses in Q4, suggests short-term pressure on profitability, which could weigh on the stock price in the near term.
