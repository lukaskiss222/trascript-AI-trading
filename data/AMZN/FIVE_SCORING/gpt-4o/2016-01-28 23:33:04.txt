Amazon's Q4 2015 transcript highlights strong financial performance, including revenue growth of 22% and significant increases in operating cash flow and free cash flow. The substantial growth in AWS revenues by 69% and increases in Prime membership indicate positive operational momentum.

Despite these concerns, the strong growth metrics and operational success may lead to a positive short-term impact on Amazon's stock.
