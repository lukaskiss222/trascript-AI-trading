Amazon's Q2 2007 financial results exceeded expectations with strong revenue growth of 35%, a marked increase in EGM revenue by 55%, and raised gross margins. The company's focus on third-party sales and strategic initiatives in international markets and new fulfillment centers point towards sustained performance. Given the upbeat guidance for Q3 and robust operational metrics, the stock is likely to experience positive momentum in the short term due to investor confidence in Amazon's growth strategy and execution.
