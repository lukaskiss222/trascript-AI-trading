Amazonâ€™s Q2 2014 earnings call indicates mixed short-term implications for the stock. Despite a 23% revenue growth and increasing Prime memberships, the company reported a GAAP net loss due to significant investments in AWS, original content, and device launches. The guidance for Q3 projects a larger operating loss, causing investor concern over profitability in the near term. Although the company is making strategic investments in future growth, the near-term impact is likely to be negative as these expenses overshadow revenue gains.
