Amazon's Q1 2009 earnings call highlighted robust growth metrics with an 18% increase in worldwide revenue, significantly driven by a rise in electronics and general merchandise sales. While the guidance for Q2 suggests a potential revenue slowdown, partly due to anticipated FX impacts, core operational metrics like a high free cash flow growth of 82% and strong customer engagement (30% unit growth) are positive indicators. Despite conservative Q2 guidance, the overall financial performance and management's focus on areas like Fulfillment by Amazon and AWS suggest resilience and potential for positive surprise in the short-term, supporting a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock.
