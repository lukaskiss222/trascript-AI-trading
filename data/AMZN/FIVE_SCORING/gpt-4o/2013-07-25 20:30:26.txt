Amazon's Q2 2013 earnings call indicates positive growth in key segments, with a 22% increase in revenue and a steady expansion in Prime memberships. Despite a GAAP net loss of $7 million, the company's focus on investments in new technologies, fulfillment capacity, and digital content underscores its long-term growth strategy. The international business is in investment mode, specifically China, which might weigh on short-term profitability, but the overall growth prospects appear encouraging. Given these factors, the short-term stock impact is likely moderately positive as the market might focus on revenue growth and potential in newer business areas.
