Amazon's Q1 2013 earnings call demonstrated solid growth with a 22% increase in worldwide revenue, despite a weaker GAAP operating income and reduced free cash flow due to high capital expenditures. Management highlighted strong growth in media and electronic goods, as well as sustained expansion in fulfillment and technology infrastructure. However, guidance for Q2 suggested challenges, including unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and a wide range of potential operating losses. The positive tone regarding future investments and customer satisfaction, including the Prime and Kindle ecosystems, may provide some support, but near-term concerns about margins and growth moderation could weigh on the stock.
