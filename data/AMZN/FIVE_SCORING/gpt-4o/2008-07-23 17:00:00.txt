Amazon's Q2 2008 financial results demonstrated robust revenue growth of 41%, buoyed by strong performance across both media and electronics. Despite a slight decline in gross margins, the company maintained high growth in unit sales and active customer accounts, which are positive indicators. Management's guidance for Q3 suggests continued strong growth, albeit with cautious notes on operating income due to increasing fulfillment costs and macroeconomic uncertainties. Overall, the company's performance surpasses expectations, and the optimistic guidance is likely to positively impact the stock price in the short term.
