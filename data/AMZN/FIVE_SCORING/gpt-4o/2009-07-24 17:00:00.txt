Amazon's Q2 2009 earnings showcase strong financial health with significant growth in revenue, extensive customer and seller base expansion, and particularly high growth in the electronics and general merchandise (EGM) segment. Despite media sales pressure influenced by industry slowdown, Amazon's other ventures, including Kindle and Web services, are thriving. The conservative guidance reflects possible foreign exchange impacts and seasonal expenditure increases. The acquisition of Zappos is poised to bolster their soft lines category. Overall, the positive financial performance and strategic growth initiatives suggest a short-term positive stock impact.
