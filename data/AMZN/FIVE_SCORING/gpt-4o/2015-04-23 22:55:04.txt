Amazonâ€™s Q1 2015 earnings call highlighted robust growth, especially in its AWS segment, which saw a revenue increase of 49% with a robust operating margin of 16.9%. Despite a GAAP net loss primarily due to stock-based compensation and international losses exacerbated by foreign exchange rates, Amazon continues extensive investment in Prime with signs of significant user and revenue growth. Management's cautious yet growth-oriented guidance for Q2 anticipates continued challenges from foreign exchange rates, but the overall tone was positive with a focus on strategic long-term investments. This suggests a generally positive short-term outlook as the market digests strong AWS growth and resilient Prime customer expansion.
