Amazon's Q1 2022 earnings call highlights several challenges and opportunities. The company faced substantial incremental costs in Q1, driven by inflation, labor, and fulfillment overcapacity issues, totaling $6 billion. Management anticipates some improvement in Q2 but expects these cost pressures to persist, leading to $4 billion in incremental costs. Despite this, Amazon reported strong AWS growth and maintained robust consumer demand, with competitive delivery speeds and expanding Prime membership. The tempered revenue and margins guidance for Q2 and cost pressures could negatively impact the stock short-term as investors may be concerned about profitability amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.
