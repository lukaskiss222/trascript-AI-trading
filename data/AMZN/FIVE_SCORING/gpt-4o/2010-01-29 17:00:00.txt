Amazon's Q4 2009 earnings transcript highlights a strong performance, with notable growth in revenue and net income, far exceeding expectations. The company reported significant advancements in free cash flow, increased active customer accounts, and a substantial rise in both North American and international revenues. The guidance provided for Q1 2010 suggests continued robust growth, although factors like foreign exchange rates and deferred Kindle revenue are acknowledged. Managementâ€™s positive tone and the lack of significant adverse external factors point to a likely positive impact on the stock in the short term.
