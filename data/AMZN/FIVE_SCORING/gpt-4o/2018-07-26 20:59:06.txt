Amazon's Q2 2018 earnings call highlights strong profitability and margin improvements driven by AWS's continued growth and efficiencies in operations, outweighing expectations. The advertising business is showing rapid expansion, significantly contributing to gross profit, and international operations are seeing similar efficiency gains. Despite the traditionally heavy Q3 fulfillment center build-out, the company maintains a positive profit outlook. The strategic acquisition of PillPack and advancements in Prime integration with Whole Foods suggest a robust strategy for leveraging new business opportunities, alongside ongoing investment in expanding Prime membership and device reach internationally. These factors are likely to generate positive sentiment and support a rise in Amazon's stock price in the short term.
