Amazon's Q4 2011 earnings call highlights a significant 34% growth in worldwide revenue, boosted by strong sales of digital media and third-party seller services. However, there was pressure on operating income, which fell 45% year-over-year. The guidance for Q1 2012 included a potential operating loss, reflecting high investment levels and economic uncertainties, particularly in Europe. Despite robust unit growth, the cautious guidance and potential profitability issues may weigh on investor sentiment in the short term, potentially applying downward pressure on the stock price.
