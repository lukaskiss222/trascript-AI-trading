Amazon's Q2 2012 earnings call shows significant revenue growth of 29%, supported by strong performance in their EGM and third-party seller business, indicating robust customer activity. Despite this, there is a sharp decrease in GAAP operating income and guidance projects a possible operating loss for Q3, due to investments in fulfillment centers and tech infrastructure ahead of anticipated Q4 demands. While operational metrics, such as lower shipping costs and increased active customers, are positive, the anticipated operating losses and substantial capital expenditures suggest caution and potential short-term pressure on the stock.
