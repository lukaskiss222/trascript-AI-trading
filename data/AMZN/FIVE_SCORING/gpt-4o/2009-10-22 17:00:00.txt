Amazon reported substantial Q3 2009 growth, exceeding expectations with a 28% revenue increase and a 62% rise in GAAP operating income. The company demonstrated strong performance in both North American and international segments, driven by broad-based growth across media and electronics categories. Positive guidance for Q4, reflecting expected sales growth of 21% to 36%, coupled with an ongoing focus on enhancing the customer experience, suggests investor optimism might increase. Hence, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
