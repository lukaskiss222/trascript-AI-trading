Amazon's Q3 2015 earnings showed strong financial performance, notably in AWS, which posted a significant rise in revenue and maintained robust margins. Positive momentum in North American EGM, driven by Prime adoption and expanded offerings, contributed to revenue growth. However, international exchange rate fluctuations and competitive retail environments present challenges. Management's optimistic tone and commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction suggest a potential short-term positive impact on stock, as investors may react favorably to the revenue growth and profitability improvements.
