Amazon's Q4 2007 results showed impressive growth, with revenue up 42% year-over-year and strong international expansion. Despite the gross margin decrease due in part to competitive pricing strategies, overall profit measures were strong, highlighting operational efficiency and market penetration. The positive guidance for Q1 and 2008 suggests confidence in continued growth, driven by new categories like Kindle and international expansion, and reflects resilience in consumer spending even amid economic uncertainties. This positive momentum and strong execution are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock.
