Amazon's Q1 2008 earnings call demonstrated strong financial performance, with notable revenue growth of 37% and significant increases in free cash flow and operating income. The company also provided positive guidance for Q2 with expected revenue growth between 34% and 41%. However, concerns such as lower margins in international operations due to pricing strategies and product mix changes were mentioned. Nonetheless, with maintained operational efficiency, strong growth in international segments, and a positive consumer response to new initiatives like Kindle, the short-term impact on Amazon's stock price is likely to be positive.
