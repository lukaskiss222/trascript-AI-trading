Amazon's Q1 2020 earnings call centers around a significant surge in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for essential goods, prompting massive investments in safety measures and operational adjustments. The company anticipates spending $4 billion in Q2 on pandemic-related costs, which could pressure short-term margins but highlights their strong commitment to handling increased demand. While Amazonâ€™s core services, especially AWS and Prime, show resilience and growth, potential disruptions in supply chain and high operational costs might temporarily weigh on the stock price in the next couple of weeks.
