The Amazon Q2 2017 earnings call highlighted strong growth in both revenue and Prime memberships, but increased investment in fulfillment infrastructure and AWS were emphasized, suggesting continued focus on expansion and capacity building. Management expressed confidence in expansion plans despite short-term profit margin fluctuations due to substantial investments in AWS and fulfillment centers. With the upcoming Whole Foods acquisition and consistent subscription revenue growth, the optimistic tone from management suggests that the stock might see a positive impact in the short-term as investors react to growth potential and strategic initiatives.
