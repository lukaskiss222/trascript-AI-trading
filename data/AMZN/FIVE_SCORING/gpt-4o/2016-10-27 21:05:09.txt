Amazon's Q3 2016 earnings call revealed ongoing high investments in digital content and fulfillment centers, highlighting increased expenses impacting short-term profit margins. While international growth, particularly in India, is promising, challenges such as low international margins and heightened expenditure on Prime Video and AWS were noted. This investment-heavy period, seen as a step-up rather than a cycle, signals potentially moderated short-term profits, yet reflects confidence in long-term strategic growth. The short-term outlook for the stock may see some pressure due to these increased costs and margin impacts.
