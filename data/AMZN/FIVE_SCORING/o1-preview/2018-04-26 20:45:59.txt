Amazon's Q1 earnings call highlighted robust financial performance, with accelerated growth in AWS (48% year-over-year) and strong contributions from the advertising segment, now a multibillion-dollar business. The company reported higher-than-expected operating income due to strong top-line growth and efficiencies at scale. Additionally, the announced increase in Prime membership fees from $99 to $119 reflects confidence in the service's value and is expected to enhance profitability. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock price in the short term.
