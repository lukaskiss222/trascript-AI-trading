Amazon reported strong revenue growth but issued guidance forecasting a significant operating loss for the next quarter, mainly due to increased investments in AWS price reductions, content spending, and expansion activities. The deceleration in unit growth, particularly internationally, and concerns over profitability are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Consequently, the stock is expected to face significant short-term downward pressure.
