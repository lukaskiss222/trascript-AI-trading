Amazon's Q1 2006 earnings call showed strong revenue growth of 20% (25% excluding unfavorable foreign exchange rates), but declining operating income due to increased investments in technology, price reductions, and free shipping initiatives like Amazon Prime. The lowered guidance for Q2 and full-year operating income, along with uncertainties surrounding the Toys "R" Us litigation and its potential $50 million impact, may result in short-term pressure on the stock price. While management is optimistic about long-term growth from these investments, the market may react negatively in the short term to reduced profitability and margin compression.
