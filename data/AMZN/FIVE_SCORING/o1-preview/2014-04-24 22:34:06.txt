Amazon's Q1 2014 earnings showed strong revenue growth of 23%, but operating income decreased by 19% due to heavy investments in areas like AWS, international expansion, and content acquisition. The guidance for Q2 anticipates an operating loss, raising concerns about profitability in the short term. This, coupled with deceleration in unit growth and increased expenses, suggests a negative short-term impact on the stock price.
