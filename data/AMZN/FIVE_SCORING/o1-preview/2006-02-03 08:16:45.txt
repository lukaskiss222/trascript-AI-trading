Amazon's Q4 results demonstrated strong revenue growth but highlighted declining operating margins due to significant investments in technology, content, and initiatives like Amazon Prime. The company's guidance indicates lower operating income for the upcoming quarter and potential declines for the full year, which may concern investors focused on short-term profitability. As a result, the stock is likely to experience negative pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
