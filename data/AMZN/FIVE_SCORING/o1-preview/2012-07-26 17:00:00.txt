Amazon reported strong revenue growth in Q2, with sales up 29%, but operating income decreased by 47%, and net income dropped significantly due to increased investments and higher operating expenses. The guidance for Q3 projects an operating loss, which may raise concerns among investors about profitability in the short term. While long-term growth prospects remain positive due to investments in fulfillment and technology, the immediate impact on the stock price is likely negative because of the expected operating loss and reduced earnings.
