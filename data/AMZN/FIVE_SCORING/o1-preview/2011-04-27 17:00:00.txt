Despite Amazon's strong revenue and unit growth, the company reported decreased operating income and provided guidance indicating potential declines in profitability for the next quarter due to increased investments in fulfillment and technology. The higher expenses and lower margins may raise short-term concerns among investors, potentially overshadowing the robust sales growth. As a result, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to profitability concerns.
