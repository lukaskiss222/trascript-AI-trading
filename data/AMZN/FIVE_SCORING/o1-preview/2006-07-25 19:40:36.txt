Amazon’s earnings call indicates strong revenue growth but declining profitability due to heavy investments in technology, content, and aggressive pricing strategies. The lowered operating income guidance and concerns over margin compression, particularly from the termination of the Toys R Us contract and entry into low-margin categories like groceries and toys, may lead to short-term negative sentiment among investors. Therefore, the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the next 1–2 weeks.
