Amazon's Q2 2008 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth but raised concerns about future profitability. The cautious operating income guidance for Q3, due to increased fulfillment costs and potential margin pressures, suggests challenges ahead. Additionally, a significant portion of GAAP operating income was attributed to a one-time gain from asset sales, indicating that earnings may not be as robust in subsequent quarters. These factors may lead to a short-term negative impact on the stock price.
