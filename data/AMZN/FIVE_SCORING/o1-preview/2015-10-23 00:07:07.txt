Amazon reported strong Q3 results with a return to profitability, posting GAAP net income of $79 million compared to a loss in the prior-year period. Revenue grew 23% (30% excluding FX), driven by robust growth in AWS (revenue up 78%) and solid performance in North America. Improved margins and positive guidance for Q4 suggest strong momentum. The stock is likely to rally in the short term.
