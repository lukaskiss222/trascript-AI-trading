Amazon reported strong revenue growth, particularly in its Electronics and General Merchandise (EGM) segment and international markets, with EGM now comprising a larger portion of sales. Despite some challenges in media revenues due to industry slowdowns, Kindle sales exceeded expectations, and the acquisition of Zappos reflects confidence in future growth. Adjusted for one-time items, operating income was solid, and positive guidance suggests a favorable short-term impact on the stock.
