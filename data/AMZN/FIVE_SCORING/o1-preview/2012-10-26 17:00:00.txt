Amazon's Q3 2012 results showed robust revenue growth but a significant decline in profitability, culminating in a GAAP net loss due to investments like LivingSocial and heavy spending on expansion. The guidance for Q4 includes the possibility of an operating loss, which may raise concerns among investors about short-term earnings. Consequently, the stock is likely to experience negative pressure in the next couple of weeks.
