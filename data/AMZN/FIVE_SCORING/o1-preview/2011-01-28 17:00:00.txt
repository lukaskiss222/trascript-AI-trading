Amazon reported strong revenue growth, with worldwide revenue up 36% and unit growth at 43%. However, despite the impressive top-line figures, the company provided guidance indicating that operating income could decline by up to 34% in the next quarter due to increased investments in fulfillment centers and technology infrastructure. The potential decline in operating income and margin compression may lead to short-term negative sentiment among investors.
