Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Positives:
- Multiple major projects progressing well (Agbami, Tengiz, Blind Faith)
- Strong focus on portfolio optimization and cost management
- Solid balance sheet with low debt ratio (7.5%)
- $2B in share repurchases completed

Key Negatives:
- Significant decline in downstream profits (-$1B vs prior year)
- Major refinery outage at Pascagoula impacting volumes
- Delays in Tahiti project by ~12 months 
- Rising costs across upstream projects
- Several one-time charges impacting results

Overall, while Chevron maintains strong long-term fundamentals, the combination of weaker downstream margins, refinery outages, project delays and cost pressures is likely to weigh on sentiment in the very near-term. The stock price will likely see modest downward pressure over the next 1-2 weeks as the market digests these challenges.

Rating: [-1] Negative impact expected over next 1-2 weeks
