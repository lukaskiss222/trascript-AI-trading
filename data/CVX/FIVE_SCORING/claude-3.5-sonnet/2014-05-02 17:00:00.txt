Based on the earnings call transcript, I predict a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on Chevron's stock price.

Key points supporting this assessment:
1. Mixed operational performance:
- Production was flat to slightly down year-over-year
- Unplanned downtime at Angola LNG facility
- Weather-related disruptions impacted Q1 production
- Some delays in key growth projects

2. Financial metrics:
- Earnings declined year-over-year by $1.7B
- Cash flow was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter
- Net debt increased by $3.2B in the quarter
- Multiple asset impairment charges taken

3. Positive factors:
- Major projects (Gorgon, Jack/St. Malo) remain on track for planned startups
- Strong progress in Permian Basin development
- Maintained strong balance sheet and dividend growth

While long-term prospects remain solid with major projects coming online in 2015-2016, near-term headwinds from operational issues and higher costs are likely to weigh on investor sentiment over the next 1-2 weeks.
