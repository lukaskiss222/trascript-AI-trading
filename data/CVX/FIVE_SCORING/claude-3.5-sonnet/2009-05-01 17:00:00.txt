Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Positive Points:
- Major projects (Agbami, Blind Faith, Tahiti) ramping up on schedule
- Strong operational execution with 94% refinery utilization
- Aggressive cost reduction efforts showing early results ($500M lower OpEx vs Q1 2008)
- Maintained financial strength and dividend

Key Negative Points:
- Earnings down 64% YoY on lower commodity prices
- Net debt increased by $3.5B in Q1
- Suspended share buybacks
- Conservative guidance and outlook for remainder of 2009

The overall tone was cautiously optimistic but realistic about near-term challenges. While management emphasized cost control and project execution, the significant earnings decline and increased debt levels will likely pressure the stock in the very short term. The suspension of buybacks also removes a key support.

Rating: [-1] Negative impact expected over next 1-2 weeks as market digests weaker financials, though longer-term outlook remains solid.
