Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Chevron's stock:

Positive factors:
- Strong operational execution on major capital projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone
- Healthy balance sheet with $14B cash position
- Solid progress in high-return Permian Basin operations
- Maintained share buyback program at $1.25B per quarter

Negative/concerning factors:
- Production declined by 43,000 barrels/day QoQ and 37,000 barrels/day YoY
- Capital spending outpacing operating cash flow 
- Some delays and challenges with LNG projects (Angola LNG shutdown until 2015)
- Management avoiding specific 2015 production guidance

Overall, while the long-term growth story remains intact, the near-term headwinds around production declines and capital spending could pressure the stock in the coming weeks. The market may need more clarity on 2015 production before becoming more constructive.
