Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on Chevron's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key concerning factors include:

1. The delay in Big Foot platform installation and lost production through 2017
2. Potential further delays in Gorgon LNG startup to early 2016
3. Large asset impairments ($1.96B) due to reduced long-term oil price outlook
4. No dividend increase this quarter and cautious commentary around future increases

While management highlighted cost reduction efforts and maintained confidence in growth targets, the operational setbacks and conservative outlook on prices are likely to weigh on investor sentiment in the near term.
