Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on Chevron's stock price for the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

1. The company reported a quarterly loss of $588 million and significantly lower annual earnings compared to the previous year due to low oil prices.

2. Management indicated continued uncertainty around oil prices and acknowledged they will likely use their balance sheet (take on debt) in 2016 regardless of price levels.

3. While the company is aggressively cutting costs and capital expenditure, they face continued pressure from low commodity prices with no clear near-term catalyst for improvement.

However, there are some mitigating factors like strong downstream performance, successful cost reduction initiatives, and progress on major projects like Gorgon LNG. The company also maintained its dividend commitment. These factors prevent me from expecting a severe negative reaction.
