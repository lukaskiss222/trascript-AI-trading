Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess the short-term (1-2 week) stock price impact as modestly negative. Here's my reasoning:

1. The company announced a 13% cut to capital expenditure ($35B vs $40B previously) and suspended share buybacks due to low oil prices, signaling reduced financial flexibility.

2. While management maintained its 2017 production target of 3.1M barrels/day, there was notable uncertainty around near-term production guidance (flat to 3% growth) due to market conditions.

3. The company faces reduced cash flow and potential coverage issues for its dividend in the near term, though management emphasized dividend preservation as top priority.

However, some positives include:
- Strong balance sheet with 15% debt ratio providing financial flexibility
- Progress on major projects like Gorgon LNG
- Active cost reduction initiatives underway

Overall, while long-term prospects remain solid, near-term headwinds from low oil prices and reduced spending will likely pressure the stock in the coming weeks.
