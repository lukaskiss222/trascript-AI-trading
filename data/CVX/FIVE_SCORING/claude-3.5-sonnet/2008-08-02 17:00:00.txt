Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Chevron's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Record quarterly earnings of $6 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by strong upstream performance and high oil prices.

2. Major projects like Agbami starting production and others (Tengiz, Blind Faith, etc.) on track, pointing to significant production growth ahead.

3. Management expressed confidence in meeting/exceeding their 2.65M bbl/day production target for 2008 (adjusted for price effects).

While there were some negatives like downstream timing losses and higher costs, the overall tone was positive with strong fundamentals and growth projects progressing well. The company appears well-positioned to benefit from the high oil price environment.
