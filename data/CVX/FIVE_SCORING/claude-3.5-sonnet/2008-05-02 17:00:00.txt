Based on the Q1 2008 earnings call transcript, Chevron reported very strong results driven by higher oil and gas prices, though partially offset by weaker downstream performance. Key positives include:

1. Earnings up 10% YoY to $5.2B with strong upstream performance
2. Major projects on track (Tengiz expansion, Agbami, Moho Bilondo)
3. Healthy 12% dividend increase and continued $2B quarterly share buybacks
4. Strong balance sheet with only 8% debt ratio
5. Positive outlook on production guidance for 2008

The only notable negatives were some weakness in downstream margins and slight production declines, but these were overshadowed by the strong pricing environment and project execution. Management's confident tone and continued return of cash to shareholders suggests strong near-term momentum.
