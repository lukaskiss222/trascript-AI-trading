Chevron's Q3 2012 earnings call depicted solid financial performance but with several concerns that might impact the stock negatively in the short term. Earnings were down 30% from the previous quarters, despite being solid, due to factors like unfavorable foreign exchange movements, lower production volumes due to weather and maintenance, and inventory effect timing. Downstream operations face headwinds in California with high-specification fuel costs and regulatory uncertainties. However, strategic investments in premium base oils and LNG suggest a positive potential long-term, but the immediate focus will likely be on these short-term pressures.
