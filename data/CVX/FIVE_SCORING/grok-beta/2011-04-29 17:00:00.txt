Chevron's Q1 2011 performance reflects several bullish signals for the stock. The company achieved record cash flows, increased its shareholder return strategy with an 8% dividend hike and a boost in share repurchases, and reported strong upstream earnings due to higher crude prices. However, the positive stock reaction could be tempered by concerns over potential changes to tax benefits and increased regulatory scrutiny in the Gulf of Mexico, which might slightly offset these positive aspects in the short term.
