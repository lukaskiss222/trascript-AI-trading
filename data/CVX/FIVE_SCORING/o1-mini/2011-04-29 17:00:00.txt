Chevron reported a robust first quarter with a 36% increase in earnings year-over-year, driven by higher crude prices and strong upstream performance. The company's commitment to increasing dividends and share repurchases, along with strategic acquisitions and positive guidance, underscores investor confidence. These positive fundamentals are likely to bolster the stock in the short term.
