Chevron reported a robust first quarter 2010 with earnings increasing 150% year-over-year, driven by higher crude prices and increased production. Despite some downstream challenges and ongoing cost-cutting measures, management's optimistic outlook and dividend increase signal confidence in continued performance. These positive factors are likely to support the stock in the short term.
