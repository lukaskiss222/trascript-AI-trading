Chevron reported strong third-quarter earnings with a 40% increase year-over-year and robust guidance for 2008. Management's positive tone on strategic projects and share repurchases outweighs concerns about potential tax impacts from Proposition 87, which remains uncertain. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a positive short-term impact.
