Chevron reported lower net income due to significant impairments and project suspensions, which may weigh on investor sentiment in the short term. However, the companyâ€™s ongoing cost-saving measures and improved core earnings could mitigate some negative effects. Overall, the stock is likely to face a negative impact in the next 1-2 weeks.
