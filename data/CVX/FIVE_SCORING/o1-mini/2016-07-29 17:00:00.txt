Chevron reported a significant second-quarter loss driven by $2.8 billion in impairments related to reservoir performance and price declines, which may weigh on investor sentiment. While the company highlighted cost-cutting measures and maintained its dividend, the immediate reaction is likely overshadowed by the negative earnings. Consequently, the stock is expected to face short-term downward pressure.
