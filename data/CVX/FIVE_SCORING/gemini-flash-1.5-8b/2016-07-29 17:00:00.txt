Chevron's Q2 2016 earnings call highlighted a significant loss, primarily due to asset impairments, particularly at the Papa-Terra field in Brazil.

Despite cost-cutting measures and focus on high-return projects like the Permian, the company faces challenges that could negatively impact the stock in the coming weeks.
