Chevron's Q1 2012 earnings exceeded expectations, driven by higher crude prices and improved downstream results.  Management highlighted strong financial performance, share repurchases, and dividend increases, all suggesting confidence in future cash flow.  However, production was down slightly due to asset sales and external constraints, an issue noted by management. The short-term impact is likely positive, with the stock poised to rally on the strong earnings and dividend increase, but potential headwinds from some external constraints should be considered.
