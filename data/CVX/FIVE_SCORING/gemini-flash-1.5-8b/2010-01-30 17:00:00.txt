Chevron's Q4 2009 earnings call highlights a mixed bag. While strong upstream performance, driven by higher crude oil prices and increased production, offset some struggles in the downstream sector, management expresses concern about the continuing challenging economic conditions in the refining sector.  The call emphasizes cost-cutting measures and portfolio rationalization, but the company maintains a focused growth strategy in upstream operations, with plans for new projects and major capital investments.  This suggests potential short-term pressure on the stock reflecting the downstream challenges, but sustained long-term investor value in Chevron's focus on upstream growth, major capital investments, and cost-management.
