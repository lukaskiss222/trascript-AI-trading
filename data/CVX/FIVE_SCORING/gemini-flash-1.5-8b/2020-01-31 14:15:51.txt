Chevron's earnings call highlighted sustained strong financial performance, record production, and a commitment to shareholder returns.  Management emphasized capital discipline, a resilient portfolio, and continued share buybacks despite a lower-than-expected fourth quarter cash flow due to tax implications and lower affiliate dividends.  The company maintains a strong balance sheet enabling continued dividend growth and buybacks, projecting flat capital budgets and production increases in 2020.
