Chevron's earnings call highlights a challenging but resilient company navigating lower oil prices.  While Q4 earnings were lower year-over-year and Q4 2014 earnings were lower than Q3 2014, management emphasizes cost-cutting measures and a strong balance sheet, projecting flat to 3% production growth in 2015.  The projected 2017 production target of 3.1 million barrels per day, despite reduced capex, suggests management believes the long-term outlook remains robust, though dependent on price recovery.
