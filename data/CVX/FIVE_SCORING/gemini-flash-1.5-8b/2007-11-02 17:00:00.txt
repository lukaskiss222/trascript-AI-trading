Chevron's Q3 2007 earnings call revealed a drop in profitability primarily driven by lower downstream margins, especially in the US West Coast.  Escalating crude oil costs weren't fully recovered in the market, and lower refining volumes due to the Pascagoula refinery fire and maintenance impacted earnings. While upstream realizations increased, lower international liftings and tax adjustments offset some of the gains.  The company repurchased $2 billion in shares and announced a new $15 billion buyback program, signaling confidence in long-term prospects despite short-term challenges.  The stock might see slight negative pressure over the next few weeks due to the declining margins and uncertainty around longer-term crude oil pricing.
