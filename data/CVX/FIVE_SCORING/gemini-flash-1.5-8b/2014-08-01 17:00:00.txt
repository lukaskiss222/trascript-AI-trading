Chevron's earnings call highlighted continued strength in upstream operations, notably from the Permian and Vaca Muerta.  Management stressed the strong cash flow projection driven by major capital projects, particularly Gorgon and Wheatstone. However, there's  uncertainty over the final resolution of the Apache partnership for the Kitimat LNG project and the potential impact on the timeline to FID.  This uncertainty, along with some downstream performance nuances, suggests a shorter-term neutral to slightly positive trend.
