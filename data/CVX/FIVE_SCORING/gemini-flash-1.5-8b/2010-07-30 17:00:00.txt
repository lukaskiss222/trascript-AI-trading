Chevron's Q2 2010 earnings call highlighted strong downstream performance and a continuation of robust upstream margins, exceeding expectations for the quarter.  The call also underscored continued efforts in capital projects and exploration, albeit with some delays in the Gulf of Mexico due to the drilling moratorium's impact on specific projects and exploration work, likely leading to delays to some FIDs and potential impacts on production output.  Management emphasized the belief that disciplined capital intensity and quality project selection will allow future growth and profitability.
