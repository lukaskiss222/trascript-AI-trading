Chevron's Q2 2012 earnings show a mixed picture, with upstream earnings down due to lower crude prices and volumes, but downstream benefiting from improved margins.  Management highlighted strong cash generation and share buybacks, positioning the company for future growth.  The positive tone and continued focus on major capital projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone suggest potential for short-term price stability, but uncertainty around Gorgon's costs and potential production timelines could create some volatility.
