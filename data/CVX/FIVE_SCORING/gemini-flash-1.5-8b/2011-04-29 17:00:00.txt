Chevron's Q1 2011 earnings exceeded expectations, driven by higher crude oil prices benefiting upstream operations.  Management highlighted strong cash generation, share buybacks, and dividend increases, signaling confidence in the company's financial health.  However, short-term impacts are present as inventory valuation effects and the absence of asset sales impacted downstream earnings. This suggests possible stock price volatility in the near term (1-2 weeks) due to shifting expectations relative to the reported results and the ongoing regulatory environment.
