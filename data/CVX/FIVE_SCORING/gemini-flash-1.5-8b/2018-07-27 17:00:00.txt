Chevron's Q2 2018 earnings call indicated strong financial performance, with earnings significantly higher than the previous year and a positive outlook for the second half.  Management highlighted a successful ramp-up of new production projects (Wheatstone Train 2, Gorgon, and Permian), offsetting some concerns about planned turnarounds.  Higher oil prices and operational efficiency are expected to continue driving strong cash flow, enabling the initiation of share repurchases.
