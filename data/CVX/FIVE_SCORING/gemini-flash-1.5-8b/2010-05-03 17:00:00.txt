Chevron's Q1 2010 earnings call highlights strong upstream performance driven by higher crude oil and natural gas prices.  Management highlights significant cost optimization, a 5% increase in net oil equivalent production, and a substantial increase in earnings compared to Q1 2009 and Q4 2009.  Lower downstream earnings, reflecting the absence of asset sales gains from 2009 and related charges, are somewhat offset by the strong upstream results.  The call suggests continued strong performance in the short-term, especially if crude oil prices remain elevated or increase.
