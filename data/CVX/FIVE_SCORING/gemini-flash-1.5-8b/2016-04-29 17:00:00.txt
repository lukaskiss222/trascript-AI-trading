Chevron's Q1 2016 earnings call highlights a continuation of cost-cutting measures and a focus on short-cycle projects.  Management emphasizes the need to balance the dividend with a strong balance sheet, which is potentially impacting capital expenditures.  Despite lower crude realizations, the call indicates a proactive approach to optimizing production and cost reduction measures, all of which suggest a potential moderate positive impact on stock price in the short term given this strategy.
