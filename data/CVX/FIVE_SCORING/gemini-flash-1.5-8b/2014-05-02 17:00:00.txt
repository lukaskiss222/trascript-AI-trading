Chevron's Q1 2014 earnings call highlights a strong financial performance, exceeding guidance despite foreign exchange headwinds and asset impairments.  Management emphasizes a commitment to shareholder distributions and balance sheet strength, indicating the potential for continued share repurchases and dividend increases. However, the call also reveals production challenges, notably the unplanned downtime at the Angola LNG facility and lower crude oil production impacting upstream earnings.  These factors, coupled with continuing project delays, suggest some near-term volatility in the stock price.
