Chevron's Q3 2011 earnings call highlights strong financial performance, driven by higher crude oil prices, asset sales, and improved margins.  Management is optimistic about the future, with record cash generation and a dividend increase.  However, there are hints of market headwinds, with lower volumes and realizations in some areas. The stock price is likely to remain positive moving forward, as strong cash-flow generation and dividend growth signal strong investor confidence.
