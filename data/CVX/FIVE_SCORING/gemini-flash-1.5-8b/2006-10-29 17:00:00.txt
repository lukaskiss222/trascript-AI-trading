Chevron's Q3 2006 earnings call highlights strong financial performance, driven by higher upstream volumes and improved margins, particularly in the US.  Management is optimistic about future production, with the upcoming Tengiz sour gas project and continued expansion in the Gulf of Mexico.  However, the call also addresses potential headwinds, such as Proposition 87 in California, which could negatively impact future activity, and the potential for reduced refining margins in the future.
