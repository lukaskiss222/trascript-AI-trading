Chevron's earnings call highlighted strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by higher oil prices and sales volumes, improved downstream margins, and asset sales.  Management expressed confidence in their long-term strategies, with a focus on disciplined growth and shareholder rewards, while maintaining financial strength.  The potential impact on production from the Gulf of Mexico moratorium in the United States raises a short-term uncertainty but overall, the call points to a positive outlook for the short-term (1-2 weeks), though uncertainty remains regarding regulatory issues that affect current and future production.
