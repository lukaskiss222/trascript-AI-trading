Chevron's Q1 2013 earnings were strong, exceeding expectations with $6.2 billion in earnings.  Management highlighted high returns on capital employed, share repurchases, and dividend increases.  However, lower cash flow generation from operations, primarily due to higher working capital requirements in the Downstream segment, is a potential short-term concern. The stock is likely to maintain positive momentum given the strong financial performance and management outlook, but investors should monitor the working capital situation closely in coming weeks.
