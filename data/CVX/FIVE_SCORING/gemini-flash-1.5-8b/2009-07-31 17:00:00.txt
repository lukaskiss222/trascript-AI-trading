Chevron's Q2 earnings, while down significantly from Q2 2008, show a moderate improvement from Q1 2009 driven by higher crude oil realizations.  However, significant foreign currency headwinds and lower downstream margins suggest a cautious outlook.  Management's emphasis on cost-cutting and strong project execution in upstream, coupled with a dividend increase, could potentially support the stock in the short term.
