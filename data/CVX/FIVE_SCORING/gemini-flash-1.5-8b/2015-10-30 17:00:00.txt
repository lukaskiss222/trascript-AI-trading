Chevron's earnings call highlights a shift in strategy due to low oil prices.  Management emphasizes balancing cash flow to maintain the dividend while reducing capital expenditures and operating costs.  They project lower base business spending and accept lower production growth rates in the short-term.  The anticipated production increase in 2017 largely comes from ramping up existing projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone.
