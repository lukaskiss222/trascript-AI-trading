Chevron's Q3 2021 earnings call highlighted record earnings driven by high commodity prices, strong margins, and increased volumes.  Management stressed capital efficiency and cost-cutting measures, but also pointed to planned turnarounds and repairs in Q4, which will lessen production.  Positive guidance for share repurchases and a lowered full-year CapEx outlook suggests a favorable short-term outlook for the stock.
