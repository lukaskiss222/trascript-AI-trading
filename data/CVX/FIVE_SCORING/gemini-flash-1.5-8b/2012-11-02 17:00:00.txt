Chevron's Q3 2012 earnings call highlighted significant foreign exchange headwinds, particularly impacting upstream and downstream segments.  While the company maintained strong cash flow and repurchased shares, the significant declines in earnings compared to prior quarters, driven in part by inventory revaluations and lower realized margins, suggest a short-term cautious outlook. Management's cautious projections and concerns about global economic factors such as weakening Chinese demand add to the short-term negative outlook.
