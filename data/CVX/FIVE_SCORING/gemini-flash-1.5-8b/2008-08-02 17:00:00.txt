Chevron's Q2 2008 earnings transcript shows a strong upstream performance supported by record-high crude oil prices, but downstream results were significantly impacted by the same price increases.  Management highlighted numerous ongoing major projects, and while acknowledging short-term production impacts due to price effects, confirmed their target for the year will be met or exceeded. The cautious tone around downstream results suggests short-term volatility and the need for strategic adjustments in the face of unpredictable markets.
