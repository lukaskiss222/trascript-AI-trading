Chevron's Q1 2007 earnings show a strong performance, exceeding expectations, primarily due to the gain from the Nerefco sale and improved refining margins in several regions.  Management highlighted ongoing exploration success, such as the start-up of the Bibiyana field, and indicated a potential increase in share buybacks, suggesting continued confidence in the company's financial health. Positive guidance and a renewed focus on reliability in downstream operations point towards continued positive momentum in the near future.
