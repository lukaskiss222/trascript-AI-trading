 Chevron's Q2 earnings impress with robust Upstream margins and robust cash generation. However, the focus for investors should be on the modest full-year production outlook reduction and the conservative share repurchase program. The decompression in share price in the short term is warranted due to uncertainty around production growth and spending discipline.
