Chevron's earnings transcript reveals a mixed bag for investors. While upstream earnings were boosted by higher oil prices, substantial forex losses and lower downstream profits dusked the overall performance. Notably, production and new projects perform well, with some ahead of schedule. Cost-cutting measures are also progressing. However, the focus on U.S. gas drilling reduction and risks surrounding Nigeria operations are concerns. The stock is likely to remain stable in the short term, enduring pressures from elevated CapEx and uncertain global markets.
