Though Chevron's Q3 earnings remained flat YoY, produced solid results amidst market challenges. Downstream's restructuring, focused on cost reduction and portfolio high-grading, is on track. The sale of non-core assets, along with share repurchases, indicates financial flexibility. While upstream faces headwinds due to foreign exchange losses and exploration expenses, major projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone, along with new discoveries in Australia, bode well for future growth. The recent lifting of the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium is positive, though the impact of delayed permits remains uncertain. With a strong cash position, Chevron is well-placed to navigate the current environment, but the stock is likely to experience a modest negative impact in the short term due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties in the Gulf of Mexico [-1].
