Despite meaningful downstream losses and higher capital expenditures, Chevron's earnings call revealed promising upstream projects and robust production growth prospects. The delay in major projects like Gorgon is concerning, but the management remains focused on operational efficiency and empowering sharebuyers through accelerated repurchase programs. The stock is likely to experience a short-term dip due to subdued downstream performance but could rally in the longer term on the back of expansive upstream projects.
