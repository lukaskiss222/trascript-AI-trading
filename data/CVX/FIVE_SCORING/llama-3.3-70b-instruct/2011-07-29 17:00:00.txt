Chevron's Q2 2011 earnings call revealed strong financial performance, with earnings up 43% year-over-year, driven by higher crude oil prices and improved margins in both Upstream and Downstream segments. The company's return on capital employed was over 19%, and its debt ratio was 9.1% at the end of June. Chevron increased its share repurchase target to $2 billion for the third quarter, reflecting its confidence in its cash flow generation. The company's production outlook for 2011 was revised downward to 2.73 million barrels per day, primarily due to a recent incident in Thailand and a slower-than-planned ramp-up of the Perdido project in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
