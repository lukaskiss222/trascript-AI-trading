Chevron's earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with strong underlying operating results but significantly lower financial performance due to low oil prices. The company is responding to the low-price environment by reducing investment, cutting costs, and divesting assets. Management's tone was cautious, with a focus on maintaining the dividend and living within their means. Despite the challenges, Chevron's strong balance sheet and growing flexibility in spend position it well for when the market balances and prices rebound.
