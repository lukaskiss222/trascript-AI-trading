Chevron's Q3 earnings were $3.8 billion, or $1.92 per diluted share, with a 51% decrease from Q3 2008 but a 120% increase from Q2 2009. The company's strategic progress, including the Gorgon LNG project and Wheatstone LNG project, is on track, with a focus on cost management and a 13% decline in recurring expenses. Management expects the refining and marketing segment to face a weak period due to oversupply, but sees growth opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.
