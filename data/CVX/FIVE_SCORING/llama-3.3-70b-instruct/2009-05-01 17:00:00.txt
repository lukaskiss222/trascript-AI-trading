Chevron's Q1 2009 earnings report revealed a 64% decline in earnings compared to Q1 2008, primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices. However, the company's production volumes increased, and its major capital projects are on track to meet growth targets. Chevron's management emphasized cost-cutting efforts, with an 8% reduction in SG&A and operating expenses compared to Q1 2008. The company also highlighted its progress in strategic growth initiatives, including the development of its major capital projects and exploration program. Despite the challenging commodity price environment, Chevron's financial position remains strong, with a debt ratio of 12% and a return on capital employed of 22%.
