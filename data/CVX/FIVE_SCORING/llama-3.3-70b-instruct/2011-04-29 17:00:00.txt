Chevron's Q1 2021 earnings call revealed a strong financial performance, with earnings up 36% year-over-year, driven by higher crude prices and improved margins. The company's Upstream segment benefited from increased oil and natural gas realizations, while the Downstream segment saw improved refining margins. Chevron also announced a 8.3% increase in its quarterly dividend and plans to increase its share repurchase rate to $1 billion in the second quarter. However, the company faces short-term headwinds, including delays in drilling permits in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced production forecasts due to higher prices.
