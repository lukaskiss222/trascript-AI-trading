**Analysis:**

Chevron's Q3 2015 earnings call highlighted a challenging market environment with low oil prices and cost-cutting measures. The company's management emphasized the importance of maintaining the dividend and growing it as earnings and cash flow permit. Key points include:

- **Financial Performance:** Q3 earnings were $2 billion, or $1.09 per diluted share, with cash from operations at $5.4 billion. Downstream cash generation was strong, while upstream cash flow fell due to a 20% drop in global oil prices.

- **Cost-Saving Measures:** The company is working on reducing costs across the organization, with enterprise operating costs down 12% year-over-year. They aim to achieve annual spend reductions of approximately $4 billion.
- **Asset Sales:** The company continues to divest assets, with proceeds from asset sales totaling $11 billion over the last seven quarters. They expect to generate another $10 billion in sales proceeds from 2014 to 2017.
