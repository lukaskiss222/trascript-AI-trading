### Analysis:

Chevron's Q3 2018 earnings call highlighted strong financial performance, with earnings per share (EPS) of $2.11, up from $1.06 in the same period last year. The company reported a significant increase in cash flow from operations, driven by higher realizations and growing volumes in both the U.S. and international upstream sectors. The company also announced plans to pay $2.1 billion in dividends and repurchase $750 million of shares during the quarter. Additionally, Chevron reported positive production trends in the Permian, with production growth of 80% year-over-year, driven by high-density fracs and efficient well placement. The company also announced plans to expand its refining presence in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which could provide additional synergies with its Permian operations.

### Conclusion:

Chevron's strong Q3 2018 financial performance and positive production trends in the Permian should have a positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. The company's commitment to capital discipline and shareholder returns, as well as its plans to expand its refining presence in the U.S. Gulf Coast, should provide additional upside potential for the stock. However, the stock may face some short-term pressure due to concerns about potential fiscal tightening in certain regions and the risk of lower oil prices in the future.
