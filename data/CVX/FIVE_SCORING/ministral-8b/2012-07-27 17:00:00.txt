### Analysis:
The earnings call for Chevron Corporation in the second quarter of 2012 revealed several key points that could influence the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks. The company reported strong financial performance with earnings of $7.2 billion, but there were some concerns regarding production and cost management, particularly related to the Gorgon LNG project. The update on the Gorgon project highlighted cost overruns and uncertainties, which could impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the delay in the start-up of the Frade field in Brazil and the turnaround at Tengiz SGI/SGP in Kazakhstan could affect production. However, Chevron's robust cash position and strong portfolio of projects provide a foundation for long-term growth.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on Chevron's stock price is likely to be negative due to the uncertainty surrounding the Gorgon project and production delays. The stock may experience volatility as investors digest the details of the earnings call and assess the potential for cost overruns and production disruptions. The stock is expected to face downward pressure in the near term.
