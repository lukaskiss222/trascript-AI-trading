**Analysis:**

Chevron's Q3 2006 earnings call provided a mixed bag of news. The company reported strong financial performance, with earnings up 40% compared to Q3 2005 and 15% from Q2 2006. However, there were some concerns about Proposition 87 in California, which could potentially impact Chevron's producing assets. Additionally, the company faced challenges with the UK tax changes and the Empresas Mixtas conversion in Venezuela. Despite these challenges, Chevron's management remained optimistic about the company's prospects, highlighting the progress of key projects and the strong balance sheet.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Chevron's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the uncertainties surrounding Proposition 87 and the UK tax changes. However, the company's strong financial performance and progress on key projects may provide some support to the stock price. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure but has the potential for a rebound in the coming weeks.
