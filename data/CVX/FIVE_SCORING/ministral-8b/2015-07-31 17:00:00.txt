1. **Financial Performance:**
   - The company reported a net income of $571 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, which was lower than expected due to impairments and other charges.

2. **Operating Costs and Capital Expenditures:**
   - Chevron is actively working to reduce operating costs and capital expenditures, aiming to lower its cost structure and improve efficiency.
   - The company has identified more than $3 billion of spend reductions, with about half coming from organizational reviews and half from supply chain negotiations.

   - The company has committed to covering its dividend from free cash flow in 2017, and management indicated that they are committed to maintaining the annual dividend payment history.
   - However, management also noted that they will not be raising the dividend in the current quarter due to the challenging financial environment.

4. **Project Delays and Cost Overruns:**
   - The company reported delays in projects such as Big Foot and the Partitioned Zone, which could impact future cash flows and earnings.
   - Management indicated that they are working to mitigate these issues and are optimistic about the long-term prospects of these projects.

5. **Market Conditions:**
   - The company is facing a challenging market environment with low oil prices, which has led to reduced cash flows and earnings.
   - Management indicated that they are working to adapt to these conditions and are committed to maintaining their dividend and reducing costs.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on Chevron's stock price is likely to be negative due to the lower-than-expected earnings, significant impairments, and cost overruns.

Overall, the short-term outlook for Chevron's stock price is negative.
