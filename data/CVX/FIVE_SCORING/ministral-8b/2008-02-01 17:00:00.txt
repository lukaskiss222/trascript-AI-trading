**Analysis:**

Chevron Corporation's earnings call revealed mixed signals. The company reported record earnings and strong performance in the upstream segment, driven by higher crude oil prices. However, downstream operations faced challenges, including lower margins and higher operating expenses. The company also highlighted delays in major projects like Tahiti, which contributed to a lower-than-expected production outlook for 2008. Despite these challenges, management remains optimistic about future growth and strategic initiatives. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and concerns around major project delays.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Chevron's stock price is likely to be negative due to the mixed earnings report, tempered guidance, and concerns around major project delays. The rating is:
