### Analysis:

Chevron's Q1 2011 earnings call indicates strong financial performance, with earnings up 36% compared to the same quarter last year. The company's cash from operations was nearly $10 billion, and the cash balance at the end of the quarter was nearly $17 billion. The company also announced an 8% increase in its quarterly dividend and a $1 billion share repurchase program starting in the second quarter.

However, there are concerns about the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium and the Atlas acquisition. The company expects to drill 70 wells in the Marcellus this year, but the pace of permitting and overall activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico remain uncertain. Additionally, the company is not yet ready to provide specific growth rates or return expectations for the Atlas acquisition.

### Conclusion:

Given the strong earnings and cash flow performance, as well as the company's efforts to manage costs and optimize its portfolio, Chevron's stock is likely to remain stable or experience a slight positive impact in the short term. However, the uncertainty surrounding the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium and the Atlas acquisition could lead to some volatility.
