**Analysis:**

Chevron's Q4 and full-year results call revealed a mixed picture. The company reported strong financial performance, with earnings of $19.2 billion, but faced challenges due to lower commodity prices and reduced capital spending. Management highlighted the company's progress on key projects, such as Gorgon and Wheatstone, and its efforts to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. However, the company's guidance for 2015 was more conservative, with a capital budget of $35 billion, reflecting the current market conditions. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Conclusion:**

The stock price is expected to experience a negative impact in the short term (1â€“2 weeks) due to the reduced capital spending and lower commodity prices. The company's efforts to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency may help mitigate the impact, but the overall outlook remains uncertain.

**Rating:**
