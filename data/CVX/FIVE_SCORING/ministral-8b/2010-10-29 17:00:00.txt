**Analysis:**

Chevron's Q3 2010 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported earnings of $3.8 billion, down 30% from Q2 2010, largely due to foreign exchange losses and higher exploration expenses. The outlook for 2011 remains positive, with a focus on major capital projects and restructuring efforts in the downstream business. However, the company's stance on Prop 23 and the potential impact of the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium could pose risks. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the mixed earnings and the uncertain regulatory environment, but the long-term prospects remain positive.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Chevron's stock price is likely to be negative due to the mixed earnings and the uncertainty around the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium and Prop 23. The company's long-term prospects remain positive, but the near-term outlook is uncertain.

**Rating:**
