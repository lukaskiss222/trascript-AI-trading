### Analysis

The earnings call for Chevron Corporation highlighted a significant decline in downstream profits, primarily due to escalating crude oil feedstock costs. The company reported a 22% return on capital employed for the trailing four quarters and retired around $2 billion of debt, reducing the debt ratio to about 7.5%. However, the stock market's challenging conditions and the company's reduced 2008 body armor forecast suggest potential short-term headwinds. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
