Chevron reported strong Q1 2023 financials with $6.6 billion in earnings, though adjusted earnings were down slightly from the previous quarter due to lower oil prices. Management emphasized consistent cash returns to shareholders, with a recent dividend increase and share buybacks at the top end of guidance, despite market uncertainties. The company continues to focus on growth in both traditional and new energy sectors with projects like TCO in Kazakhstan progressing on schedule. Short-term, the positive financial results and ongoing capital discipline are likely to support a modestly positive sentiment towards the stock.
