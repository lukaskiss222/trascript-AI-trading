Chevron's first quarter 2018 earnings call presented several positive indicators that are likely to have a short-term positive impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Earnings and Cash Flow**: Chevron reported earnings of $3.6 billion, a significant increase from the first quarter of 2017, driven by higher crude oil and natural gas prices, and improved cash flow from operations of $7.1 billion, excluding working capital effects[3|.
- **Production Growth**: The company achieved an all-time quarterly high in production, with a 4.5% increase over 2017 levels, and expects continued growth in 2018, particularly from major capital projects like Wheatstone and Gorgon[3|.
- **Disciplined Capital Expenditure**: Chevron is maintaining capital discipline, with cash capital expenditures $300 million below the first quarter of 2017, and a commitment to high-return projects[3|.
- **Permian Performance**: The Permian Basin operations showed significant growth, with a 65% increase in shale and tight production, and the company is well-positioned to manage Permian takeaway capacity and gas handling[3|.
- **Dividend Increase**: Chevron increased its dividend by 4%, reinforcing its commitment to shareholder returns[3].

Given these strong financial and operational results, the positive guidance, and the company's disciplined approach to capital management, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
