The transcript of Chevron's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call reveals several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Lower Earnings and Impairments**: Chevron reported earnings of $4.5 billion, which is $1.7 billion lower than the first quarter of 2013. This decline was partly due to adverse foreign exchange movements, lower crude oil production, and higher impairments and exploration expenses[4].

2. **Operational Challenges**: The company faced operational issues, including weather-related downtime in Kazakhstan, unplanned interruptions at Angola LNG, and higher maintenance activities in the second and third quarters. These factors could continue to impact production and cash flow in the short term[4].

3. **Positive Downstream Performance**: Despite the upstream challenges, Chevron's downstream segment showed improvements, driven by higher margins on refined product sales, lower operating expenses, and stronger chemicals results. This could provide some stability to the company's overall performance[4].

4. **Dividend and Share Repurchases**: Chevron maintained its commitment to shareholder distributions, announcing an 8% annualized dividend increase and plans to continue share repurchases. This demonstrates the company's confidence in its financial strength and cash generation potential[4].

5. **Major Projects Progress**: The company is making progress on major capital projects such as Jack/St. Malo, Tubular Bells, Gorgon, and Wheatstone, which are critical for future growth. However, these projects also come with risks, including weather and labor productivity issues[4].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Chevron's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the following reasons:

- Lower earnings and operational challenges could weigh on investor sentiment.
- However, the strong downstream performance and commitment to shareholder distributions provide some positive offsets.
- The progress on major capital projects, while risky, is a long-term positive but may not immediately impact the stock price.
