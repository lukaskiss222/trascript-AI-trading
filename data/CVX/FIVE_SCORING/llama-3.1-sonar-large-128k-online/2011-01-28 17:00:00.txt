Chevron's fourth-quarter 2010 earnings call highlighted several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Chevron reported a significant increase in earnings, with fourth-quarter net income rising to $5.3 billion, up 72% from the same quarter in 2009. Full-year earnings were also robust, at $19 billion, a 81% increase from 2009[1][2].
- **Operational Success**: The company achieved its safest year ever, exceeded production growth guidance, and made progress on several major capital projects, including those in the Gulf of Mexico, Australia, and Kazakhstan[1].
- **Financial Strength**: Chevron’s cash balances exceeded debt by $5.6 billion, and cash from operations was a record $31 billion for the full year. The company also resumed its common stock repurchase program[1].
- **Dividend and Share Buyback**: Chevron increased its dividend for the 23rd consecutive year and repurchased $750 million of its shares in the fourth quarter, with plans to repurchase another $750 million in the first quarter of 2011[1].

### Challenges and Uncertainties
- **Gulf of Mexico Moratorium**: The ongoing moratorium and regulatory delays in the Gulf of Mexico impacted Chevron’s ability to drill new wells, which could affect future production and project timelines. Although the company is optimistic about getting back to work, the timing remains uncertain[1].
- **Cost Pressures and Project Delays**: There are cost pressures and potential delays in projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone due to labor issues and market conditions, although these are being closely managed[1].
- **Reserve Booking**: The reserve replacement rate was lower than expected due to SEC rules and the timing of major capital projects, which could lead to some short-term investor concerns about future production growth[1].

Given these points, here is the likely short-term impact on Chevron's stock:

- The strong financial performance, operational successes, and financial strength are likely to support the stock.
- However, uncertainties related to the Gulf of Mexico moratorium and potential cost pressures in major projects might introduce some volatility.

### Conclusion
The overall positive financial and operational results, coupled with the company's strong financial position, are likely to have a positive impact on the stock. However, the uncertainties and challenges mentioned could temper this positivity slightly.
