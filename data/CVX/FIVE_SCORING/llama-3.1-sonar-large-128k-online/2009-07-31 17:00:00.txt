The transcript of Chevron's second quarter 2009 earnings call reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

## Financial Performance
- Chevron's second quarter earnings were $1.7 billion, down 71% from the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices and adverse foreign currency effects[5].

## Operational Highlights
- Despite the challenging economic environment, Chevron's major capital projects, such as Tahiti, Agbami, and Blind Faith, are performing well and contributing to production growth. The company expects a 5% increase in full-year production over 2008 levels[5].

## Cost Management
- Chevron is ahead of its target to reduce operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses by $2.5 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. This cost-cutting effort is expected to continue and support the company's financial health[5].

## Guidance and Outlook
- The company has revised its full-year production outlook upward and expects strong project execution and cost management to drive future growth. However, the outlook is sensitive to oil prices, with an average oil price assumption of $50 per barrel[5].

## Capital Expenditures and Projects
- Significant progress has been made on major projects, including the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects, which are critical for long-term growth. However, the timing and financial details of these projects are still being finalized[5].

Given these points:

- The short-term impact on the stock price might be mixed. On one hand, the company's strong operational performance, successful project execution, and aggressive cost-cutting efforts are positive indicators.
- On the other hand, the significant impact of foreign currency effects, lower commodity prices, and reduced downstream margins could weigh on the stock in the short term.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact due to the mixed signals from the earnings report, particularly the adverse foreign currency effects and lower commodity prices.
