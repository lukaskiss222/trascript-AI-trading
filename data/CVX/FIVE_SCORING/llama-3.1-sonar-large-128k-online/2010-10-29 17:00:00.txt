The third quarter 2010 earnings call for Chevron Corporation revealed several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Earnings and Cash Flow**: Chevron's third quarter earnings were $3.8 billion, flat compared to the third quarter of 2009 but down 30% from the second quarter of 2010. Despite this, the company had strong cash generation, with the third quarter being the strongest since 2008[4].

2. **Foreign Exchange and Other Items**: The earnings were negatively impacted by significant foreign exchange losses and other non-cash items, which do not affect cash flow but can influence earnings perception[4].

3. **Downstream Performance**: Downstream earnings were lower due to adverse foreign currency effects, timing variances, and softer refining margins. However, the company is progressing well with its restructuring efforts, including cost reductions and portfolio high-grading[4].

4. **Upstream Challenges**: Upstream earnings were affected by the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium, higher exploration expenses, and foreign exchange losses. The moratorium is expected to have ongoing impacts, although the company is working to resume activities as quickly as possible[4].

5. **Capital Projects and Growth**: Chevron is advancing several major capital projects, including the Jack/St. Malo and Wheatstone developments, which are expected to contribute to long-term production growth. The company also highlighted its exploration successes and new resource acquisitions[4].

6. **Share Repurchase and Dividends**: Chevron announced a new share repurchase program, targeting $500 million to $1 billion per quarter, which could positively impact shareholder value[4].

Given these points:

- The short-term impact might be slightly negative due to the lower-than-expected earnings in the third quarter and the ongoing challenges in the upstream segment.
- However, the company's strong cash generation, ongoing restructuring efforts, and significant capital projects suggest a robust long-term outlook.
- The share repurchase program and steady dividend stream could also support the stock price.

**Rating: -1**

This rating reflects the short-term pressure from lower earnings and upstream challenges, balanced against the company's strong cash position and long-term growth prospects.
