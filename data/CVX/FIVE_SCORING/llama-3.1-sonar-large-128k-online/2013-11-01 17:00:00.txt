The Chevron Corporation's third quarter 2013 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Cash Generation**: Chevron reported $10 billion in cash generated from operations in the third quarter, with year-to-date cash generation of approximately $25 billion, which is a strong indicator of financial health[4].
- **Upstream Performance**: Despite some challenges, the company saw higher realizations and increased production in certain areas, such as the Delaware Basin and the Permian, contributing to upstream earnings[4].
- **LNG Projects**: Progress on major LNG projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone, along with strong demand outlook for LNG, suggests long-term growth potential[4].
- **Dividend and Share Buybacks**: Chevron continued its share buyback program, repurchasing $1.25 billion in shares during the third quarter, and maintained a strong dividend payout, which is attractive to investors[4].

### Negative Factors:
- **Earnings Decline**: The company's earnings were down from the same quarter a year ago, largely due to foreign exchange effects and lower margins in the downstream segment[4].
- **Operational Challenges**: Delays and challenges in projects like Gorgon, including logistics, labor productivity, and weather issues, could impact short-term performance[4].
- **Higher Costs**: Increased DD&A charges and higher operating expenses, particularly in the downstream segment, are expected to continue, which could pressure earnings margins[4].

### Conclusion:
Given these points, the short-term impact on Chevron's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the earnings decline and operational challenges, despite the positive cash generation and long-term growth prospects.
