The transcript of Chevron's second quarter 2013 earnings call presents a mixed outlook that could influence the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Earnings and Revenue**: Chevron reported $5.4 billion in earnings for the second quarter, which is lower than the first quarter and the same period in the previous year. This could lead to short-term disappointment[5].
  
- **Operational Updates**: The company highlighted several positive operational updates, including the startup of the Angola LNG project, progress on Gorgon and Wheatstone, and increased activity in the Permian Basin. These developments suggest long-term growth potential but may not immediately impact the stock price[5].

- **Capital Expenditures and Debt**: Chevron is in a period of high capital expenditures due to large projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone. While these projects are expected to contribute significantly to future production and cash flow, the current high spend could raise concerns about near-term financial metrics[5].

- **Share Buyback and Dividends**: The company continues to repurchase shares and maintain a growing dividend, which can support the stock price by indicating confidence in future cash flows and commitment to shareholder returns[5].

- **Guidance and Outlook**: The production guidance remains unchanged, and the company is confident about meeting its 2017 targets. However, the timing of some projects and the impact of working capital effects could introduce some short-term volatility[5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the lower-than-expected earnings and high capital expenditures, but the long-term prospects and operational updates suggest stability.
