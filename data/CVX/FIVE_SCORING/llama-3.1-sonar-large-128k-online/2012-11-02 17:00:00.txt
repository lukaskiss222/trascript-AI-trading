Chevron's third-quarter 2012 earnings call revealed several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Earnings Decline**: Chevron's third-quarter earnings were down about 30% compared to both the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange effects, lower production, and weaker downstream margins[4].

2. **Production and Maintenance**: Significant production impacts from planned turnarounds and weather-related disruptions, such as Hurricane Isaac, were noted. However, production is expected to increase in the fourth quarter as these disruptions are resolved[4].

3. **Downstream Challenges**: Downstream earnings were negatively affected by lower margins, inventory valuation effects, and lower volumes, particularly at the Richmond Refinery due to a crude unit shutdown[4].

4. **Capital Expenditure and Cash Flow**: Despite the earnings decline, Chevron maintained strong cash generation, with operating cash flow of over $26 billion year-to-date. The company also indicated that capital expenditures would be back-end loaded, which is consistent with historical patterns[4].

5. **Dividend Commitment**: Chevron reiterated its commitment to a competitive dividend policy, with a strong focus on maintaining and growing the dividend stream for investors[4].

6. **Regulatory and Market Uncertainties**: The call highlighted significant regulatory challenges in California, which could increase costs and impact future profitability in the downstream segment. Additionally, there were concerns about global economic trends and their impact on refining margins[4].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the earnings decline, production disruptions, and downstream challenges. However, the company's strong cash generation, commitment to dividends, and ongoing strategic investments could mitigate some of this pressure.
