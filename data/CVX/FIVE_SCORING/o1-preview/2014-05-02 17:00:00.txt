Chevron's first-quarter earnings showed a significant decline compared to both the previous quarter and the same period last year, largely due to lower production volumes, higher costs, and asset impairments. While management emphasized progress on major projects and increased dividends, the immediate concerns over decreased earnings, operational setbacks like the Angola LNG shutdown, and higher DD&A expenses may lead to short-term negative sentiment among investors. Consequently, the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
