Chevron's Q4 earnings showed resilience amid falling oil and gas prices, with downstream gains offsetting upstream weaknesses. However, the company announced it will not repurchase shares in Q1 2009 and expects higher production decline rates, indicating it won't meet previous growth targets. These factors, along with a challenging economic environment, suggest short-term headwinds for the stock.
