Chevron's earnings call revealed concerns over potential cost overruns at the Gorgon LNG project due to currency fluctuations and higher labor costs, which may weigh on investor sentiment. Additionally, delays in production from key projects like Frade and Angola LNG, along with lower upstream earnings, could negatively impact the stock in the short term. Despite strong downstream performance and a solid financial position, the uncertainties may lead to short-term pressure on the stock price.
