Chevron's earnings call revealed lower earnings due to significant declines in downstream margins, especially on the US West Coast, and operational issues like refinery fires impacting production. Additionally, delays in major upstream projects such as the Tahiti project raise concerns about future output growth. These factors are likely to exert short-term pressure on the stock price.
