Chevron reported record earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year 2007, driven by higher crude prices and strong upstream performance. However, the company revealed a low reserves replacement ratio of 10â€“15%, significantly below expectations, and lowered its 2008 production guidance due to project delays and higher prices impacting production-sharing agreements. Additionally, continued losses in the downstream segment could raise concerns among investors. These factors are likely to exert short-term pressure on the stock.
