Chevron's Q1 earnings call revealed a quarterly loss and ongoing challenges from low oil prices. Despite management's efforts to reduce costs and maintain the dividend, delays in major projects like Gorgon LNG and cautious guidance may lead to short-term investor concern. As a result, the stock may face negative pressure over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
