Chevron reported strong first-quarter earnings, exceeding expectations with their highest earnings since 2014, driven by increased production and strong cash flow. Management highlighted production growth, particularly in the Permian Basin, increased dividends, and maintained capital discipline. The positive results and confident outlook are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
