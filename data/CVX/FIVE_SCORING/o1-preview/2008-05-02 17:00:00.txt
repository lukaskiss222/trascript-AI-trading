Chevron reported strong first-quarter earnings, with profits up nearly 10% from the prior year, driven by higher crude oil and natural gas prices. The company increased its quarterly dividend by 12.1% and continued share buybacks, reflecting confidence in its financial position. Progress on key projects and positive management tone suggest a favorable outlook, likely boosting the stock price in the short term.
