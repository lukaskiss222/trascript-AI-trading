Chevron reported strong second-quarter earnings with net income up 43% year-over-year and record cash flow of nearly $11 billion. The company increased its share repurchase program and maintained confidence in long-term production growth despite a slight reduction in 2011 guidance due to temporary operational issues. The robust financial performance and shareholder returns are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
