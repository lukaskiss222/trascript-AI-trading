{"2007": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2006, "date": "2006-10-29 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Matt, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter 2006 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Steve Crowe. Please go ahead, sir.\nStephen Crowe: Thank you, Matt. And welcome everyone to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call. Today, on the call, I am joined by Paul Siegele, the Vice President of our Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Exploration, and Irene Melitas, our Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2006. We'll refer to the slides that are available on the web. Before we get started, please be reminded that today's presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the \"Safe Harbor\" statements on slide two. I'll begin with slide three, which provides an overview of our financial performance. The Company reported results of $5 billion or $2.29 per diluted share for the quarter. Our earnings were up 40% compared to the third quarter 2005, as noted in the earnings press release. Third quarter results were up 15% from the second quarter 2006, which Irene will discuss shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing four quarters was 23%. Our balance sheet continues to show financial strength and flexibility. The debt ratio remained at 13% at quarter-end. Our capital and exploratory spending was $4.1 billion for the quarter. Stock repurchases were $1.4 billion for the quarter. With cumulative purchases totaling $3.8 billion, we expect to complete the current $5 billion program by yearend. And finally, our year-to-date total shareholder return is running about 22%. Irene will now take us through the quarterly comparisons. Irene?\nIrene Melitas: Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. My remarks compare results of the third quarter 2006 to the second quarter. As a reminder, our earnings release compared third quarter 2006 to the same quarter a year ago. Turning to slide four. Net income was about $660 million higher in the third quarter. Starting with the left side of the chart, higher realizations benefited upstream results in the US, but were largely offset by the effects of lower commodity prices internationally. The positive margin variance in downstream reflects stronger marketing margins, particularly in the US. Third quarter earnings benefited from higher upstream volumes, mostly due to higher international upstream lifting. The variance in the residual other bar is the net of everything else, and reflects the absence of last quarter's $250 million abandonment charge in associated with last year's Gulf of Mexico storms as well as higher chemicals results. Offsetting these favorable variances are an increase in environmental reserve, a negative swing in tax-related items, and other miscellaneous items. Slide five summarizes the results of our US upstream earnings, which were roughly $370 million higher between quarters. Higher realizations, particularly for liquids, benefited earnings by $65 million. The $1.92 per barrel increase for liquids between quarters was more favorable than the change in industry benchmark prices, and contributed to a favorable $60 million variance between quarters. While the average quarterly price for WTI was about flat between quarters, the Gulf of Mexico benchmark trade month price, which is on a lag basis, rose by $5.60 per barrel. Slightly higher natural gas realizations resulted in a positive $5 million profit effect. Though Henry Hub bid week prices declined, our average realizations improved by $0.04 per thousand cubic feet, reflecting our regional production mix. The effects of storm recovery volumes in the Gulf of Mexico and one additional producing day benefited earnings by $30 million. The positive variance in the abandonment bar represents the absence of last quarter's charge of about $250 million for higher abandonment costs associated with structures and wells damaged from last year's hurricanes. The variance in other is the net of everything else and includes a favorable swing in FAS 133 effect of about $20 million. Turning to slide six. International upstream earnings for the quarter were about $140 million lower than the second quarter's earnings. Lower realizations reduced earnings by about $45 million. While spot brand prices rose $0.33 per barrel, unit realizations on liquids declined by $0.34 per barrel, reflecting country mix effects. Higher liftings during the quarter, particularly in Australia and Azerbaijan, resulted in a positive earnings variance of $250 million. At the end of the quarter, liftings were essentially in balance with production. The variance in tax related items reduced earnings by $240 million between quarters. As highlighted in our interim update for the quarter, the negative swing primarily reflects the effects of recently enacted UK tax increases on North Sea oil and gas producers as well as the net of other tax related items. The variance in other is the net of everything else and includes higher exploration and operating expenses. Slide summarizes our worldwide oil equivalent production volumes during the last three quarters. The figures include volumes produced from oilsands in Canada and production under an operating service agreement in Venezuela. Production has trended up this year, with the second quarter volumes being 25,000 barrels per day higher than the first, and the third quarter about 30,000 barrels above the second. The steady increase has occurred in both our US and international operations. During the third quarter, the volume increase in the US of 4,000 oil equivalent barrels per day was attributable to the restoration of volumes shut-in due to last year's storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting this increase were the effects of maintenance activities and normal field declines. Outside the US, oil and gas production increased by 27,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter. The improvement was driven by production in Eurasia, following an annual turnaround at Tengiz, and the full-quarter effects of the BTC pipeline in Azerbaijan; in Canada, following planned turnaround at Athabasca during the second quarter; and in Angola, due to the continued ramp-up of the Benguela, Belize, Lobito fields. These increases were partially offset by lower production elsewhere, particularly in Denmark, due to seasonal requirements and a plant shutdown. During last quarter's conference call, we discussed the estimated effects on production volumes for the second half of the year arising from the anticipated conversions from Empresas Mixtas in Venezuela. The actual conversion took effect during the first half of October and is expected to reduce fourth quarter production levels on the order of 90,000 barrels per day. Turning to slide eight. US downstream net income rose by about $275 million between quarters led by stronger marketing margins, lower crude costs, and improved refinery operations. Our realized margin effects of $260 million contributed favorably to earnings relative to the second quarter, reflecting more robust marketing margins, particularly in the West, and the lower cost of supplying crude oil to the US refineries, including a favorable swing in final pricing adjustments for long-haul crudes. Lower refining margins partially offset the results. In the West, the ANS refining indicator margin declined by $9.70 per barrel between periods, and in the East, the Gulf Coast light-heavy differential indicator declined by $2.94 per barrel. In the West, the Los Angeles Dealer Tank Wagon to spot motor gasoline indicator improved $9.43, as the decline in spot prices outpaced the decline in dealer tank wagon prices. In the East, the Houston Rack to Spot indicator margin rose $2.35. Improved margins for aviation fuels, asphalt and lubricants also contributed to marketing results. The other variance reflects higher earnings in pipeline, partially offset by higher fuel price effects and other miscellaneous items. Turning to slide nine. International downstream earnings of $610 million were higher than the second quarter by about $165 million. The realized downstream margins increased earnings between quarters by about $100 million, and was driven by improved marketing margins in most regions and beneficial inventory effects that were partially offset by weaker refining margins. Sales volumes resulted in a positive variance between quarters of $15 million, on higher seasonal demand and less refinery downtime relative to the second quarter. Finally, the variance in other includes higher shipping results, improved petrochemical margins in Korea, and other miscellaneous items. Slide 10 shows chemicals results were $168 million in the third quarter compared to $94 million in the second quarter. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company's stronger performance for the quarter was primarily due to higher ethylene and benzene margins. The other bar includes our Oronite additives business, whose earnings were higher in the third quarter due to improved margins and lower non-manufacturing expenses, and a favorable swing in foreign exchange results. Slide 11 covers all other. The third quarter variance was largely due to the absence of a second quarter gain from the redemption of the Company's investment in Dynegy's preferred stocks, reflected in the P&L businesses bar. The variance in other is the aggregate of all other items and includes an $80 million increase in environmental reserves as mentioned in our interim update guidance for the quarter. The effects were partially offset by several discrete items, including various beneficial tax related adjustments, favorable changes in interest income and interest expense, and other miscellaneous items. Our third quarter interim update guidance for this segment calls for net quarterly charges in the range of $160 million to $200 million, excluding Dynegy. Actual net charges for the quarter were lower. That completes our brief analysis for the quarter. Back over to you, Steve.\nStephen Crowe: Thanks Irene. Just yesterday Chevron announced its decision to participate in the first phase of Shell Canada's planned expansion of the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Alberta, Canada and a sanctioning of the Perdido regional project in the US Gulf of Mexico's ultradeep water to develop the Great White, Tobago, and Silvertip fields. Earlier in the quarter, we also announced the results of the Jack well test in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. As mentioned at the start of our call here with us today is Paul Siegele, Vice President of our Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Exploration, who will discuss this prospect and put it in a context of our overall Gulf of Mexico portfolio. Paul?\nPaul Siegele: Thanks Steve. Let me start by saying a few words about our broader Gulf of Mexico activities, which are shown on slide 12. The Gulf of Mexico is a core producing asset for Chevron and produce 223,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as Chevron share. This position in existing infrastructure will be an important enabler in bringing on our future deepwater production. Chevron is the largest leaseholder in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, is currently developing Tahiti and Blind Faith discoveries, and as just mentioned by Steve, has recently sanctioned the Perdido project operated by Shell. Tahiti and Blind Faith have expected first oil deliveries in 2008, and Perdido is expected to startup around the turn of the decade. In addition to our capital projects, we are actively engaged in appraising other discoveries and we have key exploratory wells to be drilled over the next several years. Our position in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico will be an important contributor to the Company's future growth. On the next slide, turning to Jack, Chevron announced the original discovery in September 2004. The appraisal well Jack 2 was drilled a year later in 2005. An extended well test was conducted on the appraisal well. This test was critical because the rocks in this part of the lower tertiary have low permeability and there was uncertainty about the flow rate. The test was conducted during the second quarter of 2006, and was designed to evaluate a portion of the total pay interval. During the test, the well sustained a flow rate of more than 6,000 barrels of crude oil per day. This is encouraging new because at that flow rate, a prospect of a commercial discovery is improved. There is a lot of oil in place in the Jack structure, and Chevron has a leading exploratory position in the trend. More than a half a dozen world records for test equipment pressure, depth, and duration were set during the Jack test. For example, the perforating guns were fired at world-record depths and pressures. Additionally, the test tree and other drill stem test tools set world records. The team achieved these records with no days away from work and no spills. Our next steps are to incorporate the flow test data into our reservoir simulations and optimize development scenarios. This work will take the better part of next year and we also will have to decide if we will need additional appraisal drilling to move the project forward. It is too early to set first production dates until we complete our appraisal assessment and our simulation work. The capital required is likely to exceed $3 billion, consistent with other Gulf of Mexico deepwater projects. Jack is located close to the St. Malo discovery, and synergistic development of both fields is a possibility. Turning to slide 14, Chevron is the number one operator of Lower Tertiary Wilcox discoveries, with interest in 6 of 12 discoveries in the trend. The Jack well test results and evaluations are key to unlocking the potential of this trend, and Chevron is in the position to utilize these advantages in our expansion of this emerging trend. In our estimates, the lower tertiary trend could contain 3 to 15 billion barrels estimated ultimate reserves. The lower end of that range is probably already been discovered leaving an upside here of over 10 billion barrels. Again, these rocks are tight; they are buried very deeply, and located at a long way from existing infrastructure. The Jack well test results combined with Chevron's technical capabilities will be a key to unlocking the potential of this trend. With participation in 6 of the 12 discoveries, Chevron has built a knowledge base and a lease base that is a leader in the industry. It is still early days with lots of work ahead of us, but this is a very exciting and promising prospective trend. Back over to you, Steve.\nStephen Crowe: Thanks Paul. Well, that concludes our prepared remarks. Paul will join us for the Q&A if you have additional questions about the Jack Well test or the lower tertiary. We'll now take your questions. One question per caller, please and we'll try to wrap-up at or before the top of the hour. So, Matt, will you please open the lines.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Bruce Lanni of AG Edwards. Your question, please.\nBruce Lanni: Yes, good morning, Steve, Paul, Irene.\nStephen Crowe: Good morning, Bruce.\nIrene Melitas: Good morning, Bruce.\nBruce Lanni: Good quarter. I have actually -- well, I have more than one question, but I will just ask my one question. Any thoughts about what the potential financial impact could be if Proposition 87 is passed in California as far as on the producing assets? Have you --\nStephen Crowe: Well, thanks, Bruce. As another Californian, I hope you will vote appropriately come Election Day. For those of you who may not be familiar with it, here in the State of California, there is a proposition, Number 87, that would impose up to a 6% severance tax on production here in the state. As the largest producer in the state of California, while it's -- a lot of the particulars concerning the actual application of this proposition have yet to be finalized, you know, we could see at current prices and current production levels a penalty on Chevron on the order of $200 million. The last we've seen of the external assessments as to the status of this proposition is that it's essentially in a dead heat. So it's been moving back and forth between the proponents and the opponents. But right now, statistically, it's too close to call. So that's one proposition that could have a bearing on Chevron. Clearly there have been other tax effects in this high price environment over the last year that have affected us and other companies in differentially sort of ways. There was an increased tax in the state of Alaska that had a fairly minimal impact on Chevron. It was effective the first of April, as I recall, and there are other things that are occurring. So just to reiterate, the impact on us for the state of California if this proposition were to pass is about $200 million. That's a before-tax number. And so we will see how it plays out.\nIrene Melitas: Thanks, Bruce, for your question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, Steve, and a real nice good morning to you. I'm trying to work out how to mix my series of questions into one question, but I will give it a go.\nStephen Crowe: Paul, I have every confidence that you'll be able to achieve that.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. It's a question for Paul really, and it starts firstly with more on the Great White project. I don't think you gave a CapEx number. If you could give us that and confirm that you said that Jack was 3 billion in your expectations, if you could go on to talk a little bit about the returns that you expect relative to conventional deepwater, if you will, as opposed to the ultra-deepwater that we are talking about here, and if you could then address why Trident has not been mentioned in the development plan for Great White, that would be interesting. And finally, if you could talk about relinquishments and the potential loss of acreage from what seems to be a lower level of exploration activity for you guys, that would be great. Thanks a lot.\nPaul Siegele: Paul. You managed to succeed in getting as many items as you possibly\u2026\nPaul Sankey: I think it ended up not being a question after all.\nPaul Siegele: I'll tell you what I'm going to go drill through what I remember\u2026\nStephen Crowe: Before turning it over to Paul, as I recall, I don't believe any development cost has been quoted with respect to Great White, and any such specifics probably should be addressed by the operator rather than ourselves. But as to some of the other parts of your question, I'll ask Paul to respond.\nPaul Siegele: Yes. So that's right. I think anything specifically about the Perdido ought to go to Shell. The 3 billion figure -- and I think it's important to state that at this point everything is still on the table in terms of development options at Jack. And so that could be something as low capital as an FPSO early production system. The $3 billion would be kind of a standard spar, which is close to what it's costing us at Tahiti. Returns in the ultra-deep, you know, they can still be pretty robust, although we're seeing cost increases continuing to rise even though crude oil prices have stabilized. So typically, they are still north of 20%, 25% even in the ultra-deep. As to Trident, we have two discoveries in the Perdido, Trident and Tiger, both were not committed to the regional host. And that was partially due to optimization for the facility size. And that's to say that the incremental costs to bring them on in the first phase, you know, weren't economic. So we are planning to bring them on later on. And in fact, there is a kind of key exploratory well to be drilled just north of Tiger that might serve as a separate outlet for that discovery. Did I catch everything, Paul, or was there something else?\nPaul Sankey: The final thoughts of that single question was, well, firstly, if you could just clarify the north of 20% that you are talking about for returns, is that off a $50 oil or --?\nPaul Siegele: Yes, $55.\nPaul Sankey: $55. Great. And the final part was that we've got the significant relinquishments issue in the Gulf of Mexico and the tightness of rigs and, you know, the potential for you to lose acreage I guess if you don't explore in the context of a very tight rig market. It would be very interesting to hear what you have to say about that. Thanks.\nPaul Siegele: Yes. So we will be faced with quite a turnover in the next three years. We have three rigs under long-term contract, and we have contracted for two additional new builds. So while we will see a lot of churn in our acreage, I'm not concerned at this point about letting good prospects go. We will see smaller things or things that were picked up for different trends. For instance, in the Walker Ridge/Keithley Canyon area, a lot of that acreage was picked up for a Miocene play 10 years ago prior to the emergence of this lower tertiary play. So a lot of it's going to go back into release. But it's not -- we are not concerned at this time that we will not get to the key prospects in time.\nPaul Sankey: Thanks. Just any observations on rig markets and then I will leave. I promise. That's it. Thanks.\nPaul Siegele: Well, they are tight as you know. And particularly for this play, there is probably only half a dozen to a dozen in the world that can drill to these depths in these water depths. So that is part of what led us to committing to the two new builds. But I guess what I would say, though it' a tight market, we feel like we've got adequate rig needs. What we really have is kind of a short-term crunch in the next year or so as we've got our rigs tied up with developing Tahiti and Blind Faith. We are having to go out and do deals for the exploratory portion of our program. But we think it's really more of a year or so, year-and-a-half tight market for Chevron in particular.\nStephen Crowe: Thanks, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: Thanks you.\nStephen Crowe: Thanks, Paul. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Leggate, Citigroup. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you, and good morning. Hi, Irene, Paul and Steve.\nIrene Melitas: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: Steve, I'm going to try and bolt a couple together as well, and it's basically on production guidance. Clearly, your guidance in the second quarter was 2.6 for the second half, and Venezuela obviously has helped you in the third quarter. With seasonal recovery in the back end of the year, would we be right to think in the range of 2.7 for the second half? And the bolt-on is to just bring us up to date with the key drivers for 2008. And if we could talk specifically about how you see incremental margins changing as, let's say, we see the Tengiz sour gas project come on versus some of the declines that you have? Thanks.\nStephen Crowe: As was the case in the second quarter call, we advised that for the second half of the year, production would run about 2.6 million barrels a day working on the premise that the Empresas Mixtas would take effect in the early part of the third quarter. As Irene had mentioned in her remarks, the Empresas Mixtas has taken effect during the first half of October. And that's part of the reason or main reason why the production levels in the third quarter were 2.7. The impact of the Empresas Mixtas on our OSAs at LLC 652 and Boscan would be about 90,000 barrels per day. So Doug, I would expect for the fourth quarter the production to be something north of 2.6. We are seeing additional production coming on BBLL portion of the BBLT large project. But, as close as we can measure it, that would be a reasonable estimate. In essence, I'm taking the third-quarter volumes and adjusting it for Empresas Mixta. You pointed out as to next year, I think the volume projections that we see would probably still after allowing for the Empresas Mixta be not dissimilar to what we had talked about at our analyst meeting in March. We will be -- we are in the throes of reassessing the production guidance that we will be giving for 2007. And you also had alluded to the fact that we have new production coming on for the TCO expansion. Current indications are that that would start up for the combined two phases of that project in the middle of 2007, and that will be a very profitable prospect. So we're looking forward to increasing production, and as we look forward, each of these large projects that we have been talking about for the last couple of years are progressing as expected and coming on stream.\nStephen Crowe: Thanks for your question. Next one, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Jennifer Rowland of JP Morgan. Your question please.\nJennifer Rowland: I have a follow-up question on the Lower Tertiary. Can you give us a sense of how active you plan to be there in '07, and maybe you can tell us the number of exploration wells that you're targeting in '07? That would be helpful.\nPaul Siegele: Let's see exploration wells in '07. You know, I don't have the rig queue in front of me. I know that there is at least one or two. I mentioned before '06 and '07 we've got our three rigs tied up with the developing -- excuse me, Tahiti and Blind Faith. So we're planning to do additional drilling at Saint Malo and Jack, although we still have to decide if that is going to be required. But for '07, I'm guessing we'll have one or two in the Lower Tertiary exploration wells.\nStephen Crowe: Thanks Paul. Next question, please?\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers. Your question please.\nPaul Cheng: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nStephen Crowe: Good morning, Paul.\nIrene Melitas: Hi.\nPaul Cheng: I'm wondering, Steve, can you comment that any progress in the neutral zone was an expansion? And since you guys have already mentioned the pilot project there, without an official expansion, will you be able to book any research?\nStephen Crowe: Thank you, Paul. Well, we are in the throes of negotiating with the Kingdom an extension of the project of our concession. No reserves would be booked until that concession has been agreed to and the extension agreed upon. But you're quite right. We are moving forward with the pilot projects to demonstrate our capacity to increase production in the area.\nPaul Cheng: Steve, can I just ask one quick follow-up -- a quick question\u2026\nStephen Crowe: Sure.\nPaul Cheng: \u2026on a different subject? You're talking about refining and marketing. Versus the second quarter, can you break down for us that how much is the increase in marketing, and how much is the decrease in the refining margin between US and non-US?\nStephen Crowe: Thanks, Paul. Chevron has one business segment that covers refining, marketing and transportation, and we geographically split it between the US and international. We don't have separate segments for refining and marketing, but certainly using indicative margins if you want to arrive at prices at the refinery gate, you can directionally get some flavor as to how the refining side of the house is performing relative to the marketing side. Looking at the US, for example, the refining margins as we showed in the interim update narrowed during the third quarter. Simply the product prices at the refinery gate, their decline outpaced crude costs. On the flip side, marketing margins would have widened in the third quarter as the product price at the refinery gate decline -- outpaced the decline of the prices to our customers. That shouldn't be terribly surprising as you would expect in a falling crude price environment, some stickiness with the price change to our customers. In Chevron's case, a couple of other things to keep in mind as you look at our performance at least in the US. We have a fair amount of long-haul provisionally priced crudes, which in a rising market penalizes results and in a declining market benefits them. We also, as mentioned on the call last quarter, we're long in marketing relative to refining in the Eastern part of the United States. But the key thing I really want to leave you with is the excellent operating performance that we had at our refineries here around the system. In our earnings release, we commented on the fact that for the fuel refineries in the United States we were running at near design capacity for crude input. And looking at a few other indicators in terms of the downstream units within the refinery, we've seen that our refinery utilization in the third quarter of '06 has been as high as it has ever been in darn near four years. So operating performance was a key portion to our profitability. I think by analogy you can make some similar comments looking at some of the indicator margins overseas, but clearly there are more dispersed markets, and it's harder to make a single generalization. There are, as we pointed out in the last conference call, problems of being -- looking at what the industry indicator margins call for and what any one company may ultimately realized. I hope that helps for you, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nStephen Crowe: Next question.\nOperator: Next question is from Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse. Your question please.\nMark Flannery: Yeah, hi. My question is about the UK tax changes. And I'm sorry if you covered this in the prepared remarks. I missed some of them. But other companies have broken that number out into two or three pieces, one being the in quarter impact of the higher taxes, the impact on the deferred tax items and the prior period, i.e. the catch-up back to 2006 at the beginning of the year. Can you do that for us so we can get better comparability between your results and others?\nStephen Crowe: Sure. Irene, do you want to cover that one?\nIrene Melitas: Sure. Hi, Mark. This is Irene.\nMark Flannery: Hi, Irene.\nIrene Melitas: Yes. What we booked in the third quarter was roughly $230 million, and that was consistent with the guidance that we had provided in our interim update. You are right, that is comprised of several deferred components. We did have a onetime deferred tax adjustment which was in the order of magnitude of about $130 million, and then we had a catch-up adjustment, if you will, for the first six months of roughly $75 million, and then the balance is the current tax.\nMark Flannery: Great. Thank you very much.\nIrene Melitas: Sure.\nStephen Crowe: Thanks Mark. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Gilman of Benchmark. Your question please\nStephen Crowe: Good morning, Mark.\nMark Gilman: Good morning, Steve, Paul and Irene. A Lower Tertiary question, and then further rules allowing, I want to sneak one other quick one in. There has been no drill stem test or extended production test at all to my knowledge in the Perdido. And I am wondering on what basis given that, Paul, that you're comfortable that the permeability in that portion of the trend will be comparable to that that you have observed in the Jack test?\nPaul Siegele: Yeah. That's a great question, Mark. I'm glad you asked it because I think there is a confusion about the Perdido. The whole trend is the same age. It's Lower Tertiary. But in the Great White area, there is a 100-foot interval or so that has excellent porosity and permeability, unlike the rest of the trend. So Jack and Saint Malo and really the greater Lower Tertiary trend is pretty much tight everywhere it has been penetrated. But in that Great White area, there is a good porous and permeable zone, and that is serving as kind of the anchor for that development. And we've had several penetrations there, and none of the partners felt that a flow test was required.\nMark Gilman: If I can follow that for just a second, my recollection, Paul, is that there were significant permeability-oriented concerns in and around the time Unocal was drilling and appraising Trident. So I guess one could assume that is outside that sweet spot you alluded to.\nPaul Siegele: It is interesting because Trident is -- I forget if it is slightly older or slightly younger -- it is a different rock, and it is again still in that Lower Tertiary. But the difference in Trident is it is a channelized sand, which means it kind of comes and goes over the structure, whereas the rocks at Tiger and at Great White and Tobago and the others are all kind of a blanket sheet sand. And there really is not the same kind of problem. That's one of the reasons why Trident did not get into the original commitment into the host.\nMark Gilman: Thanks, Paul. Just one other quick one. Tengiz, it appears there has been difficulties with sanctioning and approving the CPC expansion. And my understanding is that is running 80%, 85% full. What does that mean in terms of the sour gas expansion at Tengiz when it comes on? Is there going to be room in CPC to move it, or do we go to a trains, boats, planes, cars and whatever else transportation alternative to move that to market?\nStephen Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Mark. When the expansion comes on in the third quarter, as I mentioned middle to third quarter of next year, clearly the pipeline will not have been expanded at that juncture. We have been in continuing negotiations for quite some time to achieve that. So we have arranged and will be in a position to move the incremental crude out of Tengiz much as we had done in the early days before the pipeline came on, and as you described, we have got lots of railcars lined up and facilities to move it to market. Thanks very much, Mark.\nMark Gilman: Thank you, Steve.\nStephen Crowe: May I have the next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from John Herrlin of Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.\nJohn Herrlin: Yes. Thanks. Like other financial analysts, it will be multipart because I cannot count.\nStephen Crowe: John, that's all because of Paul at the beginning. Fire away.\nJohn Herrlin: With the Lower Tertiary for the tight portion, Paul, clearly it has got less permeability. Do you have one interstitial cement? Can you say that? And then, looking at kind of a subservice development, not a topside development, how many more wells would you have in that kind of play versus a Miocene play just to give us a sense of development?\nPaul Siegele: Yes. Another good question. Let me make sure I understood. Did you say, does it have one interstitial cement?\nJohn Herrlin: Well, I was wondering if you have interstitial cements whether -- do you have any cement at all in the sands or you know viable?\nPaul Siegele: No, the sands are well cemented. They are very fine grained. And they are also very uniform over long, long distances. So I guess the answer to your question is we need more wells than a typical Miocene play. One of the blessings of this play is the very thick oil column. So all you have to do is slant the wells at a high angle, and you sort of get the same benefit of the amount of surface area exposed to the rock as a horizontal well. So part of what is able to overcome this lower permeability is the tremendous volume of oil there and the tremendous rock that you have to work with. But yes, there will be -- we will need to have more wells than a Miocene development. And just how many wells is kind of the key work that we are doing now with the reservoir model. In other words, do you do a fuel wells in the center as a sweet spot, or do you try to get the entire fringe, do you use horizontals, do you use multilaterals? There are lots of different kinds of development options to consider.\nJohn Herrlin: Is it too early to determine the drive mechanisms of water driver depletion?\nPaul Siegele: I don't know the answer to that.\nJohn Herrlin: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.\nStephen Crowe: Thanks, John. May we have the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Daniel Barcelo of Banc of America. Your question, please.\nDaniel Barcelo: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. A question if I could on California operations. Firstly, maybe just to expand a little on Prop 87. I don't know if you could quickly review for us your capital spending now in California, what we should think about in terms of decline rates? And then, what impact, if any, you would think that royalties could have on some future activity or production? And the second thing, if you will permit me just on California, on downstream earnings, this quarter is clearly about marketing, particularly obviously the West Coast. In the past, a lot of California dealers when they had some high pricing was often followed by some longer periods of very low margins. Sometimes I think if I recall it even prices inverted to spot. I don't know if you saw a similar situation coming up and basically what you're seeing now in terms of dealer margins in the fourth quarter. Thank you.\nStephen Crowe: Well, with respect to your Prop 87 related question, we -- I don't have the information that is specific to our capital spending here in the state of California. But if you want to follow-up with Irene off-line, we can see what information we can provide. But typically we don't provide on them from a financial disclosure point of view that level of specificity. In the West here in California, we really do have, at least for Chevron very much integrated R&M margins, and with that arbitrariness that I had described earlier in response to Paul Cheng's question of establishing spot values at the refinery gate, from time-to-time we have seen inversions on the marketing side. They usually don't last very long as you compare, say, in the face of motor gasoline dealer tank wagon prices to spot load gas prices, but they have occurred from time-to-time. Obviously in the recent past here, we have seen integrated margins go south as we have progressed during the course of the third quarter and here into the early fourth quarter. And that is about as far as I'm going to take you at this point.\nDaniel Barcelo: Thanks very much.\nStephen Crowe: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is a follow-up from Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers. Your question, please.\nPaul Cheng: Steve, can Irene maybe give us talking about the international inventory benefit and also the price finalization benefit, any current number that you can share? And also I think for Paul, if you can talk about the deep shelf, the Gulf of Mexico is an area that you guys are interested.\nStephen Crowe: Well, I'm not sure I fully understood your inventory question, but in the context of provisionally priced foreign crude, as I had mentioned to you, Chevron acquires crude. It runs in the 12 million to 15 million barrels as I recall of on the water at any point in time. And some of the conditions call for the price to be finalized a month and a half or so after or a little more after lifting. So initially it is provisionally priced. Then in a rising market, those cargoes that are provisionally priced will be revalued, and you will have a higher cost. The converse happens in a falling market, and those are some of the benefits that I had alluded to in comparing the second quarter and the third quarter. So with that rule of thumb that I gave you and with your taking an estimate of what market prices might have been at the beginning of the second, the beginning of the third and now the beginning of the fourth, you can get a rough approximation.\nPaul Cheng: Steve, is most of the benefit showing up in the US, or it is going to be split evenly between US and international?\nStephen Crowe: Well, the situation that I described to you, Paul, is all a US item. It's for the cost of goods for crude right here in the US.\nPaul Cheng: Right. And how about the international? I thought Irene saying that there would be some -- was also benefit from some inventory effect?\nStephen Crowe: We saw some short-term inventory swings that benefited the comparisons between the second and the third quarter where they were adverse in the second quarter and favorable in the third. Again, it\u2019s a function of our inventory methodology where we value inventories on a year-to-date average acquisition cost.\nPaul Cheng: No. That I totally understand. But do you have a number, a -- how much did you say, 50 million benefit, 100 million you can share?\nIrene Melitas: It\u2019s about $100 million, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nIrene Melitas: The variance.\nIrene Melitas: Yeah.\nStephen Crowe: Okay. Then we have the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeffrey Jacobe of Fayez Sarofim. Your question, please,\nJeffrey Jacobe: Steve, I had a quick question on the balance sheet. As of, I guess September 30, if you've got close to $2 billion in net cash. Any update on looking at that going forward in terms of how you get your balance sheet more efficient?\nStephen Crowe: Thanks, Jeff. Over the last couple of years, as Chevron and the rest of our industry has enjoyed high commodity prices and generated strong cash flows, we first and foremost use those cash balances to fund this very attractive queue of projects that we have in front of us. We have been talking about a couple of them in the Gulf of Mexico. We have also used those strong cash balances to increase the dividend in the last three years. Earlier this year it was for about 15.5%. A year earlier it was about 12.5% as I recall, and the year before that it was about 10%. We\u2019ve also had a first $5 billion share repurchase program that was completed in 20 months and now a second $5 billion share repurchase program that we expect will be completed in about 12 months. Nonetheless, we still have a very strong balance sheet with 13% debt, ratio and from a net debt perspective, we are actually negative net debt. But during these periods of strong commodity prices, we\u2019ve taken advantage of the opportunity to husband our cash and keep our powder dry in the event of needing to weather any downturns in the market or avail ourselves of any opportunity. In that regard, I point out that an opportunity which has proved to be extraordinarily successful was our acquisition of Unocal about a year ago. And in effecting that transaction, we issued 169 million shares of Chevron stock. By the time, we complete the current program and looking back to the first program, we will have issued a repurchase to like amount of stock as a result of these two programs that total about $10 billion. So we are comfortable with our current financial structure at this point. We expect that the Board of Directors will consider an expansion of the current share repurchase program, which should be completed by year-end. And that we will continue moving forward to make share repurchases as the conditions warrant. Thanks very much for your question. Maybe we will take one more question and then wrap it up.\nOperator: Our final question is a follow-up from Mark Gilman of The Benchmark. Your question, please.\nMark Gilman: Steve, would I be correct if I estimated as a result of the conversion to Empresa Mixta in Venezuela that your non-Boscan volumes as a result of this would go up about 28 KBD, and are you still of the belief that from a profitability standpoint this conversion is a push?\nStephen Crowe: Thanks, Mark. When we looked at the conversion to Empresa Mixta for Boscan and LL-652, we felt that from an economic point of view, we were able to maintain value for the Company and its shareholders. The OSAs were to run another 10 years, if memory serves me right, and the Empresa Mixta have a contractual term of 20. So we doubled the term. We have converted profitability on a larger number of barrels in an OSA to more profitable barrels, but a smaller number of them as an equity owner. So we should see in the short-term lower profits as a result of that, but an extension in terms of their duration. Overall, we think we have maintained value. Thanks very much, Mark.\nMark Gilman: Thank you, Steve.\nStephen Crowe: Just in wrapping up, as I sit back and I take a look at the third quarter, I have got a few takeaways from my perspective. I think we have seen some very solid and climbing production during the course of the year. As a second item, I would say that we have got -- we have seen some excellent performance, some high utilization at our refineries, and that contributed greatly to our financial performance as well. Finally, I had mentioned that the Unocal acquisition that I have alluded to, which was about a year ago, has proved to be a resounding success. And then finally, we are progressing this terrific queue of high-quality projects as has been mentioned a couple of times during the call and as we have discussed previously. So, in closing, let me say to everyone I appreciate your participation on today's call. I especially want to thank the analysts who on behalf of all the participants had asked questions during this morning's session. So Matt, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's third-quarter 2006 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect. Good day."}], "2008": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2007, "date": "2008-02-01 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Dave O'Reilly. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid O'Reilly: Thank you, Matt, and welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. I am joined by today Steve Crowe, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Aleveras, General Manager, Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and will refer to the slides that are available on the web. Turning to slide 2, before we start, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. I ask you to review the cautionary statement on this slide. I'll begin with slide 3, which provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter earnings were $4.9 billion or $2.32 per diluted share. Full year results of $18.7 billion mark the fourth consecutive year of record earnings. Our fourth quarter earnings were 29% higher than the fourth quarter of 2006, reflecting higher crude prices, which more than offset weaker downstream results. Fourth quarter earnings rose 31% compared to the third quarter of 2007, which Steve will discuss in detail shortly. Return on capital employed for the year was 23% and our debt ratio at yearend was 8.6%. Stock buybacks during the quarter were $2 billion and $7 billion for the year in total. Total shareholder return for the year was over 30%. Turning to slide 4, our total capital spending for 2007 was $20 billion. Upstream spending accounted for $15.5 billion or 78% of the total. Our cash C&E, which excludes our share of equity share of affiliate outlets totaled $17.7 billion for the year. Our announced capital program for 2008 of $22.9 billion represents an increase of $2.9 billion over 2007 expenditures. About $2 billion of the increase is earmarked for upstream, reflecting the capital-intensive phase of some of our long-term growth projects. The change in downstream spending is due to a number of investments to operate our refining network. Steve will now take us through the quarterly comparisons. Steve?\nSteve Crowe: Thanks, Dave. My remarks compare results of the fourth quarter 2007 to the third quarter. As a reminder, our earnings release compared fourth quarter 2007 to the same quarter a year ago. Turning to slide 5. Fourth quarter net income was almost $1.2 billion higher than the third quarter. Starting with the left side of this chart, significantly higher oil prices and slightly higher natural gas prices benefited the company's upstream results worldwide. Higher international liftings were also a factor. Downstream results fell from the prior quarter. The third quarter included a $265 million gain on the sale of our fuels marketing assets in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The variance in the residual \"Other\" bar is the net of everything else. Slide 6 summarizes the results of our US upstream earnings, which improved by about $240 million between quarters. Higher realizations, primarily for liquids, benefited earnings by $400 million. Chevron's US crude oil realizations were up roughly $13 per barrel. While the average quarterly price of WTI increased more than $15 per barrel between quarters, much of our Gulf of Mexico crude oil production is priced on a lagged basis and rose about $11 per barrel. Production volumes fell 1.5% between quarters largely due to operational downtime and field declines in the Gulf of Mexico. The $90 million DD&A benefit primarily reflects the absence of the third quarter's provision for asset retirement obligations. Exploration and operating expense increased about $165 million between quarters. Exploration expense was up about $90 million mostly on higher well write-offs. Operating expense was $75 million higher due to higher production taxes and maintenance costs. \"Other\" primarily reflects lower gas marketing margins. Turning to slide 7. International upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were almost $1.2 billion higher than the third quarters' results. Higher oil and gas prices increased earnings by about $700 million. Unit realizations for liquids rose by $13 per barrel, in line with the percentage change in Brent spot prices. Higher liftings during the quarter, particularly in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Australia and Nigeria, improved earnings by $280 million. Tax items benefited earnings by $210 million between quarters. This mainly reflects the absence of adverse tax adjustments last quarter along with net favorable adjustments spread across a number of countries in the current period. The variance in \"Other\" reflects the absence of asset impairment charges recorded in the third quarter, which were offset by higher operating expenses. Slide 8 summarizes the change in worldwide oil equivalent production, including volumes produced from oilsands in Canada. Production rose by 22,000 barrels per day between quarters. During the fourth quarter, US production decreased 11,000 barrels per day compared to the prior period, mainly due to operational downtime and field declines in the Gulf of Mexico. Outside of the US, oil and gas production increased 33,000 barrels per day between quarters. The increase reflected the absence of third quarter shutdowns in the UK and Azerbaijan. The Tengiz expansion project in Kazakhstan came on stream late in the fourth quarter and was gradually ramping up. Partially offsetting was a drop in Canadian volumes due to the November fire at the Athabasca upgrader and lower Hibernia production. Turning to slide 9, we'll now briefly discuss our 2008 production outlook. As a reminder, during our fourth quarter 2006 conference call a year ago, we estimated that total 2007 production would be about 2.6 million barrels a day. That estimate assumed an oil price of about $60 per barrel. Despite the impact of higher crude oil prices on net production, we were able to exceed our estimate by 19,000 barrels a day. The increased volumes came from major capital projects, fewer storm-related shut-ins and lower base business decline rates. As we look to 2008 production in a $70 per barrel price environment, we are estimating a production increase of a little more than 1%. If prices were to remain at the current $90 level, production would be on the order of 50,000 to 60,000 barrels a day lower. As noted in the slide, the 2008 production reflects an overall base business decline rate of 4.5%, which is consistent with our historical experience. We anticipate that the start-up of major capital projects in 2008 and the ramp-up of volumes from projects begun in earlier years will had about 150,000 barrels a day. These projects include the Tengiz expansion in Kazakhstan, Agbami in Nigeria and Blind Faith in the Gulf of Mexico. We also anticipate continued production growth from our Bibiana field in Bangladesh. Looking beyond 2008 production, we reaffirm our objective to grow production volumes from 2005 to 2010 by an annual rate of 3%. Before moving on to the downstream, I'd like to briefly address our reserves replacement for 2007. At the end of February, we'll file our Form 10-K with the SEC, which will have considerable detail on our oil and gas reserves. We haven't yet completed all of our governance reviews, but I can tell you today that we anticipate the 2007 reserves replacement ratio on an oil equivalent basis will be in the 10% to 15% range. This low replacement rate was affected by three primary factors. First, SEC rules require that reserves be calculated using yearend prices. The price of WTI increased $35 per barrel from the end of 2006 to the end of 2007. This large rise in commodity prices reduced our reported reserves under production sharing contracts and variable royalty arrangements that are common in international operations. We estimate the impact of higher prices reduced our replacement ratio by about 30%. Second, sales and acquisitions during the year reduced the replacement ratio by about 10%. And third, although we made a great deal of progress on our major development projects, the timing and circumstances were such that we were unable to book large reserves additions for these projects or for contract extensions in 2007. The timing of reserve recognition for these types of events vary significantly from year-to-year. Given the number of major projects in development, we anticipate a meaningful impact on reserve additions in the years ahead. Besides the information that will be presented on reserves in the 10-K, George Kirkland will discuss this topic and our outlook in more depth at the meeting with security analysts and it's webcast on March 11. He will discuss not only reserves, but also the success we've had in adding resources last year. Moving to the downstream on slide 10. US downstream operations posted a loss for the second consecutive quarter. Refining and marketing indicator margins on the West Coast improved slightly in the fourth quarter, while there was small declines on the Gulf Coast. On balance, this effect was a favorable $35 million between quarters. Higher volumes on like product for refinery production benefited the fourth quarter earnings by $50 million compared to the prior quarter. In our conference call last quarter, we mentioned the adverse impact of timing effects, such as provisionally priced foreign crude as crude prices increased $11 per barrel during the third quarter. Over the fourth quarter, the average price of WTI increased by $15 per barrel, adding to the adverse impact of this timing effects as shown on the chart. The other variance reflects higher operating expenses partly stemming from shutdowns of the Pascagoula and El Segundo refineries. Also included in this amount are the costs for provisions for litigation offset by a gain on the sale of our proprietary credit card businesses. While this slide accounts for the change in earnings between quarters, the fact remains that our US downstream business operations lost money in the fourth quarter. On an absolute basis, two major factors cause this. First, our Pascagoula refinery's crude unit was down and our El Segundo refinery was undergoing a coker upgrade to process heavier crude. This raised our feedstock costs, so our actual margins were less than the indicator margins. It also increased our operating expenses. The second factor was the sharp rise in crude oil prices. This caused us to incur loses on provisionally priced crude and to have derivative loses under mark-to-market accounting along with inventory effects in the period. These combined effects amounted to roughly $400 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 11. International downstream earnings fell $228 million from the third quarter's results. Refining indicator margins were generally higher, while marketing margins were mixed across our internationally geographic areas. On balance, higher overall fourth quarter margins offset a small adverse volume effect to produce the $40 million favorable variance shown on the chart. Most of the timing effects, which reduced earnings by $80 million, were associated with inventory accounting. The third quarter included a $265 million gain on the sale of our Benelux fuels marketing operations. The $77 million benefit shown in the \"Other\" bar includes favorable variances in foreign exchange as well as other items that were mostly offsetting. Slide 12 shows earnings from chemical operations were $69 million in the fourth quarter compared with $103 million in the third quarter. Results for olefins declined during the quarter primarily due to lower ethylene and polyethylene sales volumes and margins. The decline in aromatics was also largely due to lower volumes and margins. Included in the \"Other\" bar are tax benefits and the absence of the third quarter environmental provision, partly offset by lower additive earnings. Slide 13 covers all other. Fourth quarter results were net charges of $237 million compared to net charges of $193 million in the third quarter. The absence of third quarter environmental provisions was largely offset by a decrease in net interest income. The \"Other\" bar includes the impact of tax benefits offset by higher yearend corporate expenses. Fourth quarter net charges for this segment fell above our standard guidance range of $160 million to $200 million as we had indicated in our interim update. That concludes our brief analysis of the quarter. So Dave, back to you.\nDave O'Reilly: Okay. Thank you, Steve. And before I get to your questions, let's have a brief recap of our strategic progress in recent months. So please turn to slide 14. With our partners, we made the final investment decision to construct a $.2 million metric ton LNG plant in Angola, in which Chevron holds a 36% interest. We signed a 30-year production sharing contract with China National Petroleum Corporation to assume operatorship and hold a 49% interest in the development of the Chuandongbei natural gas area in Central China. As Steve mentioned, we initiated production from the first phase of expansion at our 50% owned Tengiz field. And although this phase did not add significantly to fourth quarter production, earlier this week we announced the milestone of increasing daily crude oil production capacity by 90,000 barrels to about 400,000 barrels per day. The addition of full facilities in the second half of 2008 is expected to further increase daily crude production capacity to 540,000 barrels per day. We signed an agreement to increase daily sales of natural gas in Thailand by 500 million cubic feet to 1.2 billion cubic feet by 2012 from company-operated offshore blocks 10 through 13, and in late October we had received 10-year extensions for these concessions to the year 2022. Our 50% owned Yosu refinery in South Korea completed its major upgrade to process heavier crude into light products. And in December we completed the second phase of modifications at our refinery in El Segundo, California, also enabling the processing of heavier crude oils into light products. In summary, 2007 was a very successful year for Chevron and our shareholders. We achieved record earnings, investors are in excellent queue of capital projects, increased our annual dividend payment for the 20th consecutive year, and repurchased $7 billion of shares, and our total shareholders return was the best among our peer group. As we enter 2008, we look forward to the completion of several major growth projects and further progress on our strategic goal. So that concludes my prepared remarks and Steve's as well, and we'll now take your questions. One question and one follow-up per caller please, and Matt, please open the lines for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers. Your question please.\nPaul Cheng: Hi, good morning guys.\nSteve Crowe: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: This is either for Steve or Dave. You talked briefly on the reserve replacement, and you're saying that you have not been able to book any reserve from the major project. Just your sense on the Angola LNG, and you have a contract extension in Thailand, Gulf. You also started with Tengiz, none of those that has been able to allow you to book any reserve in 2007?\nDave O'Reilly: Thank you, Paul. That's a good question and a fair question to ask. For the Angola LNG, we are very confident in the resource base as the plant owners have the rights to virtually all the associated gas in offshore Angola. However, before booking reserves from properties owned by others, we are securing third-party certifications. We anticipate those reserve adds in 2008 and in future years as the offshore Angola properties are developed. With respect to Thailand, we're also very confident of 1 billion barrel probable reserve base. We'll move into the P1 reserves as we delineate the field and the projects mature. But at this point at the time of signing the concessions, we don't meet the requirements for P1 for the SEC definition. Do you have a follow-up question Paul?\nPaul Cheng: How about the Tengiz that the solid gas [re-injection] presume that that would improve the recoverable rate?\nDave O'Reilly: I think where you see our 10-K, you'll find that we have a lot more detail, Paul, on increased recoveries where they are appropriate. But I think getting back to the year, I would like to emphasize the point that the reserves are there, the resources are there, but because of the fact that we have to go through a certification process because of the complexity of the Angola situation as well, technical reasons. We booked reserves in Thailand on an incremental basis because these are multiple small fields and small compartmentalized resources that you must actually develop a plan to drill and have the drillbit involved before you book the reserves. So we're confident that the resources are there. But it's a matter of timing for booking these reserves. Thank you.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nSteve Crowe: Paul, I'd also mentioned that in about five weeks when we have our Analyst Meeting and webcast in New York, George Kirkland, our EVP of Upstream, will talk more about the reserves booking, but he will also talk a good deal about the success we've had with the drillbit and the resource adds that we've had in 2007. So, you and others will be able to get a lot more detail on this subject at that point. Thanks very much for your question though, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nArjun Murti: Thank you. I had another question on the reserves. I think we certainly appreciate that Chevron does have a sizeable resource base that we call 3P reserves, and in any one year there can be volatility and one of these get booked to crude reserves. We understand the SEC pricing effects and we appreciate those disclosure, we appreciate the asset sales. But I guess it's now four years we're decently below 100%, and Chevron especially, both as a merged company or legacy, had such a long track record of exceeding 100% that something has meaningfully changed here in the last four years, despite you all actually having very good exploration success in signing a number of contracts. Is it just that, in the old days the legacy assets, North Sea, US and so forth, Indonesia, you were more predictably able to book the reserves in crude year-in, year-out, and we're in a transition to these new reserves, were the timings is more extended or has something else changed that's just causing now so many years of sub 100% even if we make some of the pricing adjustments in the asset sale adjustments?\nDave O'Reilly: Arjun, this is Dave. I'll take that question. First of all, I think, well, your observations are good one, but I think that if you go back, say, to the '90s, back over the last 20 years or so, the configuration of our portfolio has changed quite a bit. In those days, we were adding multiple, multiple small amounts of reserves over a multiple, multiple smaller fields when we get thousands of fields and thousands of developments. Our portfolio has deliberately shifted, of course, over the last 10 years or more, and now we are looking at significantly bigger projects that are much more lumpy. So you will see choppiness here in the reserves bookings. Now having said that even over the transition period over the last 10 years, our reserve replacement has been in excess of 100%. But, you're right. In the last few years, it has been much more choppy. So I expect you are going to see years when we are significantly above 100% on a one-year basis as things come together, but you're also going to find years when we're below it. And of course, all of that has been exacerbated by the pricing effects that you've talked about. I think if we look over the last few years alone, 600 million or 700 million barrels of oil have just disappeared. Actually it's a result of a fairly good thing and that is higher prices, higher earnings and higher cash flow. So you are going to see a more choppy period ahead some years when we're below, some years when we're substantially above, and it's a matter of timing. But we are adding the resources. And the examples that we cited in our response to Paul Cheng's question, I think are very good examples of projects that are complicated, particularly in the case of Angola. That required third-party certification because we don't actually, in the case of Angola, own all of those reserves. But we are entitled to them and we are entitled to book them as we are certified and following SEC rules. So thank you for the question.\nSteve Crowe: Did you have any follow-up you'd like?\nArjun Murti: That's a very full answer, I appreciate it.\nDave O'Reilly: You're very welcome. Thanks very much for your question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robert Kessler of Simmons & Company. Your question, please.\nRobert Kessler: Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to see if we could look a little bit more closely at your 2008 updated production outlook. If I go back to what you were expecting in the March 2007 Analyst Meeting, I want to say the number was closer to 2.8 million barrels a day, so roughly 150,000 barrels a day higher than what you've got in your slide today. I know a lot has changed since then. Prices have certainly increased, Tahiti has slipped, but I wanted to see if you could provide some sort of reconciliation between those two figures?\nSteve Crowe: Thank you, Robert. In our Analyst Meeting back in March of last year, you could interpolate from the bar chart that our anticipated production for 2008 would be on the order of 2.8. And as we had mentioned today at a $70 price environment, we were guiding you folks that it's 2.65. So your math, Robert, is about right. It looks to be about 150,000 barrels a day difference. We describe in the neighborhood of 95,000 to 100,000 barrels of that to a major capital project delays. As you pointed out, it's Tahiti slipping out of 2008, and it's a little slower ramp-up particularly for our TCO expansion this year. The other big component that's on the order of about 40,000 barrels a day or thereabouts would be attributable to higher prices that we're basing our production profile on this year versus the information that we showed at the Analyst Meeting. So that accounts for the lions share. But I would tell you that, as we go forward, we still expect that between 2005 and 2010, our standing guidance of increasing our production by an annual rate of 3% still holds. This timeframe will have that production more backend loaded, but we're very confident that over the next couple of years we're going be able to increase production and achieve that production growth rate. I hope that helps you, Robert. Do you have follow up on that?\nRobert Kessler: That helps. Thank you very much.\nSteve Crowe: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Citigroup. Your question, please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen.\nDave O'Reilly: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: If I could just get some clarity on that last answer, Steve, if you don't mind, because the implication of the original target was about 400,000 barrel per day increase over the five-year period. The price tag has obviously moved up. So, just to be clear, is this your consistency with that guidance even though we've had a substantially higher move in the oil price?\nSteve Crowe: That is correct. The guidance that we're giving still pins off now a $70 price tag. You recall though, Doug, back at the time that we first gave the guidance, we said our production profile from '05 to '10 would be in excess of 3%. So we think we still have some ability to accommodate the higher prices.\nDave O'Reilly: But I think, Doug, just following up on Steve's point, if prices were to go to $90 or $100 and stay there then we have to reevaluate, I think, at least at the margins some of those assumptions. But our assumption here is we're just using $70 at the moment. The reason we pick $70 on this chart that you're seeing is that it was about $70 in 2007. So we're trying to take out the impact of prices in this analysis.\nSteve Crowe: Doug, I also mentioned when I also mentioned when I was talking about our outlook for 2008, I kind of gave you some manner by which you could adjust when I commented that if prices for 2008 would be, say, in the $90 per barrel level that the production would be on the order of $50,000 to $60,000 barrels a day lower. So I have to tell you though that the price effect associated with our various contracts overseas is it varies with the price range and which those changes occur. So it's not totally linear. So the guidance that I gave you was moving, say, from a $70 per barrel environment to that of, say, a $90 per barrel environment.\nDoug Leggate: Great.\nSteve Crowe: Doug, did you have another question?\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. I've got just a short follow-up, it's on the decline rate guidance or I think you've kind of declared that for everyone to see. A lot of the projects you have, however, are coming on are arguably quite long life. Would you expect that decline rate to moderate as these new barrels come on stream?\nSteve Crowe: Yes, we would, Doug. Now, we actually did better than 4.5% during 2007, and while we're not confident enough yet in the certainty of what we're accomplishing to forecast that that's a permanent shift. But you're correct. As you move forward with longer life projects, we expect that that will make a transition at some point in the future. And that's something we'll address when we feel confident that we can forecast something that's better than 4.5%. So, at the moment we're sticking with our 4.5% guidance. Thank you.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you very much.\nSteve Crowe: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Gilman of Benchmark. Your question, please.\nMark Gilman: Dave, Steve and Jim, good morning.\nSteve Crowe: Good morning.\nDoug O'Reilly: Good morning, Mark.\nMark Gilman: I want to see if I could just try to get a better understanding of the economic structure of the Angola LNG project. I mean I think I hear what you're just saying that because you have \"rights to the gas\" it allows you to book the reserves. But it's my understanding that you are still buying the gas from Sonangol, and therefore this is not a typical integrated West African LNG project. Can you share any light on this issue at all?\nDave O'Reilly: Let me just put it this way. The plant owners are entitled to this gas under Angolan legislation. So this is legislated, but it's not all coming from one field. There are multiple fields involved. So, there is legislation in place. All of it has been fully vetted through the government. So there are other rights to this gas, and under SEC rules, we will be able to book those gases. But because not all of them fall into our gas fields, if you will, our gas production, these have to be certified, and that's what underway right now. Other than that, that's about as far as I can go in answering your question, Mark.\nMark Gilman: But Dave, aren't you buying the gas from Sonangol even in those fields where you have a working interest and an applicable production sharing timeframe?\nDave O'Reilly: It's not a purchase arrangement. It's a dedication to the plan arrangement. And that's about as far as I can go.\nMark Gilman: Thank you very much.\nDave O'Reilly: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Our next question is from William Ferrer of WH Reeves. Your question, please.\nWilliam Ferrer: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen.\nSteve Crowe: Good morning, Bill.\nWilliam Ferrer: Couple of questions for Steve -- excuse me -- a question and a follow-up on the general issue of accounting. You mentioned that the US downstream, if I got this correctly, was burdened by $400 million in the fourth quarter roughly of inventory and derivative effects. Is that related to, say, foreign oil pricing effects, or is this different and would that go away in the first quarter, for example, or how permanent might that be? And my follow-up is also an accounting question. Without getting into the nuance of timing of reserve adds, does the formality of what you will have to report at yearend influence your book DD&A as we go forward? Thank you.\nSteve Crowe: Thank you, Bill. Let me start off with the comments regarding the US downstream. As I had mentioned, in an absolute sense, we estimate that the fourth quarter US downstream results were adversely affected by about $400 million in the quarter, and there are main areas that account for this. Firstly is the downtime at our refineries. Order of magnitude, that's about $250 million impact. That reflects both planned downtime, as was the case in our El Segundo refinery when we have the coker down, as well as unplanned downtime that we had at Pascagoula as a result of the crude unit fire that occurred back in August. The components of those are both sort of a lost opportunity profit in the margin because we had to acquire more expensive feedstocks such as light, sweet crudes to input to the refineries. It also reflects that we have higher operating expense while those refineries were down. Roughly speaking, that impact of the refineries being down was about split equally between planned downtime and unplanned downtime. Now the balance of that $400 million or roughly $150 we would ascribe to, say, call timing differences, really driven by the rapid escalation in the price of crude oil from the beginning to the end of the fourth quarter. And as you pointed out, Bill, that affects both our contractual arrangements for the purchase of provisionally priced foreign crude, but also some of our derivatives that we have, which are mark-to-market at the end of each period whereas the physicals associated with that would be recognized in a different period. The inventory impacts for the fourth quarter in the US weren't all that great. There was a bigger impact overseas. So I hope that gives you and the another analysts a fix on trying to adjust to normalize, if you will, our fourth quarter US results, which are attributable, one, to the rapid rise in crude prices, and two, to the downtime that we have in our refineries. Now the second question I think you had was with respect to the impact on our DD&A rates as a result of reserve additions. And of course, that gets into the calculation for determining the DD&A rates. So it depends on where the reserve additions occur and where the decrements might occur, but it certainly influences the rate. The other item, Bill, that I'd mentioned to you is that, as we go forward, we'll be providing information in our 10-K that will address changes in our abandonment as well, and that will have impact prospectively on our DD&A rates going forward. So I don't want to go into a full accounting lesson on all of that. But your question is a good one and it will impact future years. Thanks very much for your question and your follow-up.\nOperator: Our next question is from Neil McMahon of Sanford Bernstein. Your question, please.\nNeil McMahon: I have a got an umbrella question on Nigeria, I guess it's the best way to put it. First of all, just after Shell's comments, about what's happening on the delta, obviously you've got a big position there as well and you have been affected by the outages. They suggested that potentially Olokola LNG will be significantly delayed. I just wanted to get an update from yourselves and also your Escravos GTL plant and how things are going there. Thanks.\nDave O'Reilly: First of all, our total performance in the delta has not been that significantly affected on a current basis. I think my recollection is that the impacts of disturbances there in the swamp areas onshore is less than 20,000 barrels a day net to Chevron. And we've made some significant progress over the last few years in steadily improving our situation there from two or three years ago. Secondly, I think it's too early to predict the schedule for Olokola. We have a new administration. There is a new government. There is a restructuring going on in the petroleum sector to separate NNPC and make it a commercial entity, and put the regulatory function back on the government with a number of distinct compartments, kind of an upstream sector of the government regulatory sector and a downstream sector, and then there is whole new look being given to the gas business. So in light of all of the changes in the government and the policies around how this whole area is going to be managed, I think it would be unrealistic. I haven't heard what Shell has said, but I think anyone associated with something that's brand new there would take the same position that we've got to reassess the timing of this. And wait until we understand how these policies and regulations are going to impact the business before we move forward, and I think we're in that zone right now. Hopefully, some clarity will come this as we more through 2008. Now, having said that, our main focus in 2008 will be brining the Agbami on stream. And Agbami, the FPSO is now on-site, it's been hooked up. We're continuing to complete wells, and we expect that sometime in the middle of the year or so that Agbami will be coming on stream. So, that's a kind of a long winded answer to your question, Neil, but it's probably, I think, a realistic assessment of the situation there.\nNeil McMahon: Maybe just a follow-up on that, I'm just wondering if your comments are the same for the GTL plant. And just also on Agbami, I'm surprised that when yourself and Steve mentioned about reserve replacement rate, you didn't have a bit more to add on Agbami. Have you effectively booked all of the Agbami volumes already because one presumes it's going to be on in the next few months?\nDave O'Reilly: First of all, absolutely not, but let me remind you that that the regulations there. We've booked an initial quantity but the regulations there are very specific. You have to book the most conservative end of the range on a project like that until you actually have demonstrated oil flowing and production, and that, of course, you can't do until you start it up. So there will be more bookings on Agbami. It's an enormous resource base. But we've only booked the initial quantities there so far. Now on EGTL, it's under construction. It is still progressing and we'll give you an update on the timing for that in the March meeting. But it's still actively under construction.\nNeil McMahon: Thank you.\nDave O'Reilly: Thank you, Neil. Operator Our next question is from [Eric Wilke] of Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.\nEric Wilke: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. My question relates to TCO. It's good to see that you're making progress on the expansion. You mentioned the second phase of the expansion. Can you give us some guidance on the ramp-up profile, perhaps the average contribution to second half or the anticipated exit for 2008?\nDave O'Reilly: Eric, I'd like to hold that back until March. We are making progress month-by-month there. The SGI plant, the first phase of that is up and running and has been ramping up. So, we'll have a much better handle on this as we come out of the winter month. Winter months are difficult months from a construction perspective. The temperatures there went 30 below in recent weeks. So, if you'll hang on to that question until March, we'll have, I think, a better handle on where we think we will be on the second phase of expansion there.\nEric Wilke: Okay. Fair enough. Can I ask the second expansion though on the back evacuation route, I think you made progress on CPC expansion?\nDave O'Reilly: Absolutely. Let me just, first of all, tell we have restructured the CPC arrangements to put the pipeline on a much more financially sound footing. And we're now in the phase of negotiating the terms for expansion of the pipeline. However, we're not depending on that expansion to move oil out of Tengiz. Then if you will recall that we had a long history of being able to move oil from Tengiz before there ever was a CPC pipeline from 1993 until about the year 2000. So, we have multiple options for movement of Tengiz oil. We have a very skilled and accomplished group that are capable of doing that by a number of different routes. While we obviously desire to expand CPC and believe it will be expanded, we are confident in our ability to continue to move the crude, even the additional crude from Tengiz even without the CPC expansion being in place. Thank you.\nSteve Crowe: Thank you. Can we have the next caller or question please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Gilman of Benchmark. Your question, please.\nMark Gilman: Dave and Steve, I'm wondering if I can possibly get a little bit better handle on the base US capital spending '08 versus '07. If we take out of each year the major project elements, in other words, Tahiti and Blind Faith, what would that comparison look like?\nDave O'Reilly: I think it would be rather flat, Mark, and in round numbers. It's a subtlety that isn't right at my fingertips right now, but I think it would be rather flat and it reflects the fact that we have a big resource base. We are continuing to see a lot of progress in other areas, which tend to skate on to the radar screen, for example, San Joaquin Valley, where we are continuing to make great gains in expanding our production there or at least moderating the decline. The Mid Continent area where we are beginning, of course, we've got plans to grow in the Piceance and expect to have production starting there around the end of the year. As to the specific numbers, let me call in Steve to kind of give you a little bit of a highlight.\nSteve Crowe: Mark, I think Dave's response is right on, but let me give you kind of directionally on some of the big projects. If I take a look at, say, 2007 and compare it to 2008, the spending for Blind Faith will actually be lower in '08 than it was in '07. A little bit more money will be spent for say the Great White, Silvertip, Tobago area. In the case of Tahiti, our spending in '08 will be somewhat less than it was in '07. But as Dave pointed out in the Piceance area, we see spending ramping up there in ''08 versus ''07. And while I haven't racked up all the pieces, I think the underline comment that Dave made was right. If you pulled out the big projects that are sort of identifiable in both years, the underlying spending is probably fairly flat.\nMark Gilman: So Dave and Steve, if we allow for inflation, it's actually down a little bit.\nDave O'Reilly: Well, we're not seeing as much inflation there as you say. I mean the inflation in things like deepwater and that type of thing. But land rigs and some of the other things we're doing onshore, we're not seeing quite the same rate of inflation. So I don't think you can draw that conclusion that easily. We'll try to put more depth behind that in our March meeting, Mark, and see if we can get a better handle on it for you, okay.\nMark Gilman: Dave, one more quasi-related follow-up if I could. Without regard to the timing of the ramp-up on the Tengiz expansion, are you in a position yet to be able to assess reservoir response to the injections? I noticed, Dave, when you characterize the project in your summary comments that instead of using the range of potential increase in production, you really focused on numbers at the high end with your 540,000 a day comment.\nDave O'Reilly: Well, the high end of the range, Mark, has to do with our belief in the capacity of the plant and the facilities. The reservoir response I think we're already demonstrating, because remember we've had a experience now with sweet gas injection dating over a year before we ever gone to injecting sour gas, which we've been doing now for a numbers of months. So we've already demonstrated that the reservoir is performing and we're confident that that part of it is well underway. And with time and with further expansion of facilities, we would probably be able to add further to our reserves. But the 540 is a reflection of our belief that that capacity is now demonstrably within reach. I think that's probably the best way to put it.\nMark Gilman: Okay, Dave. Thanks a lot.\nDave O'Reilly: Thank you. Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Gammel of Macquarie. Your question, please.\nJason Gammel: Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to inquire about what you're seeing for refined product demand right now in the United States, maybe particularly in California, in light of the weak refining margin conditions that we've been seeing recently.\nDave O'Reilly: Jason, let me take that. If I look back on the year, I think we're seeing a year-over-year gasoline demand actually '06 to '07 is slightly up and distillate demand up by about more than a 0.5%. Now having said that, there has been a downward year-over-year trend quarter-by-quarter during the year 2007. In the first quarter, we had year-over-year gains, in the second quarter they were somewhat less, in the third quarter -- and I am talking about nationwide -- we were seeing flat, and in the fourth quarter nationwide there was a decline in the demand, I think in the order of 0.5% to 1% with the comparable period the year before. And the West Coast [Pet 5] is no exception to that. We're seeing those same trends occur in the West as we're seeing throughout the nation. So there is no question there's been a softening industry-wide throughout '07. And I think as we start '08, its early days here, but we are probably experiencing a similar softness as we saw in the fourth quarter.\nJason Gammel: Okay. Thanks, Dave. And then, maybe as a follow-up, would you mind commenting on what you're seeing in the Asian markets that you're currently marketing in?\nDave O'Reilly: The Asian markets are still doing very well. I was in 14 developing countries during the second half of '07, and I couldn't find any one of them that was growing at less than 7% GDP. So the markets, overall, there have been performing well. They may become off a little bit at these higher prices, but many of them have subsidized oil and gas prices, and you are not seeing the sort of demand impacts there that we have seen in the rest. If I take a macro view now and bring you right back up to 40,000 feet, if you look over the last few years, I think you'll see that aggregate demand in OECD has been relatively flat and the global growth that we're seeing has been driven essentially by the developing world. Developing Asia is a big, big engine here, and the Middle East itself, where a lot of the oil and gas demand is heavily subsidized, and there doesn't seem to be any real significant slowdown occurring there. So, that's it in a nutshell.\nJason Gammel: Thank you.\nSteve Crowe: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Wilke of Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.\nEric Wilke: Thank you. Mine is just a quick follow-up on the fourth quarter US exploration expense. You mentioned that these remaining will write-off, if you can bit a more color on that that would be great.\nDave O'Reilly: There were a few in the Gulf of Mexico. And I don't have all of the specifics at hand, but they were generally in the Gulf of Mexico. I just don't have all of that at my fingertips.\nSteve Crowe: Eric, you can, after the call, give a Jim a call and he'll give you a little color commentary on that to the extent that we can talk about.\nEric Wilke: Okay, thanks.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks very much.\nDave O'Reilly: Okay. Well, I think it's coming up to the top of the hour. So I think it's a good time for us to wrap-up. I want to thank you all for participating in the call today, and I'll look forward to seeing many of you at our March Security Analyst Meeting in New York. So, thank you all again, and thank you, Matt, for hosting the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-11-02 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Chevron\u2019s third quarter 2007 earnings conferencecall.  (Operator Instructions)  I will now turn the conference over to theVice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. SteveCrowe.  Please go ahead, sir.\nStephen J. Crowe: Thank you, Matt. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call.  Today on the call I\u2019m joined by GeorgeKirkland, EVP, Upstream and Gas; Mike Worth, EVP, Global Downstream, and JimAleveras, General Manager, Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron\u2019sfinancial and operating results for the third quarter of 2007.  We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are availableon the web. I remind you that today\u2019s presentation contains estimates,projections and other forward-looking statements and ask that you review the Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Turning to slide 3, the company reported earnings of $3.7billion in the third quarter compared with $5 billion in the third quarter2006.  Earnings of $1.75 per dilutedshare were down from $2.29 per share reported for the same quarter last year. Both periods reflected about $400 million or approximately$0.19  per share of net chargesassociated with non-recurring items.  Themain driver for the earnings change was a decline of over $1 billion indownstream profits.  Escalating costs forcrude oil feedstocks could not be fully recovered in the market.  This impact was global, but it was especiallysignificant on the USwest coast. Overall, third quarter results were $1.7 billion lower than ourrecord second quarter 2007, which Jim will discuss shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing four quarterswas 22%.  During the quarter, we retiredabout $2 billion of debt, reducing the debt ratio to about 7.5% at quarter end. Third quarter share repurchases totaled $2 billion,reflecting an accelerated buyback pace. As we projected in last quarter\u2019s conference call, we completed theDecember 2006 buyback program during the third quarter.  In September, we announced and initiated anew repurchase program of up to $15 billion over a period of up to three years. Jim will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.\nJim Aleveras: Thanks, Steve.  Myremarks compare third quarter results to those of the second quarter 2007.  As a reminder, our earnings press releasecompared third quarter 2007 with the same quarter a year ago. Turning to slide 4, third quarter net income was $1.7billion lower than the record level of the second quarter.  Lower downstream margins were the mostsignificant component of the change. Upstream realizations increased, but the benefit was partly offset bylower international liftings due to the timing of cargoes. Additionally, the second quarter included the $680 milliongain on the sale of Chevron\u2019s investment in Dynegy, while the third quarterreflects a smaller, $265 million gain on the sale of the company\u2019s BeneluxFuels marketing assets. Separate from these major asset sales, there was a further$300 million adverse effect between the sequential quarters due to netnon-recurring charges.  The mostsignificant factor was the difference in tax items, contributing to a $230million variance between quarters. Addition non-recurring items, along with other factors in the aggregate,were responsible for a negative variance of about $130 million as shown on thisslide. Except for large discrete items, it has not been ourpractice to identify smaller non-recurring charges and credits.  We did so this quarter because of the largeswing in these smaller items between the second and third quarters. Just to recap, the third quarter included $415 million lessin gains on major asset sales and $300 million more in smaller, non-recurringnet charges than did the second quarter. This amounts to an adverse swing of more than $700 million betweensequential quarters of more than $0.33 per share. Turning to slide 5. Slide 5 summarizes the results of our USupstream earnings which fell by about $90 million between quarters.  Higher realizations benefited earnings byabout $135 million between quarters. Higher liquids prices contributed $250 million to earnings, but lowernatural gas realization had a $115 million offsetting impact. Chevron\u2019s domestic crude oil realizations were up about$9.80 per barrel between quarters, around $0.50 per barrel less than theincrease in average WTI spot prices. This partly reflects Gulf of Mexico productionthat is priced on a lagged basis.  This isa benefit when prices are falling, but a headwind when prices are rising. Our natural gas realization fell by a little over $1.10 perthousand cubic feet, which is in line with the average changes in bid weekpricing at Henry Hub in Californiaand in the Rockies. Our volumes were slightly lower due to storm-related shutdownsin the Gulf, maintenance work and natural field declines.  These were partly offset by one moreproducing day in the third quarter. Asset retirement obligations were higher by $60 millionmainly due to an adjustment to the abandonment provision for offshore Californiaproperties that were previously sold. The other bar on this slide reflects higher exploration expense, assetimpairment and the absence of gains on some small operations we sold in thesecond quarter. Turning to slide 6, this slide compares upstreaminternational earnings, which fell about $120 million between the second andthird quarters.  Stronger liquidsrealizations benefited earnings by almost all of the $285 million impact shownon this slide.  Natural gas effects,while positive, were essentially negligible. Liquids realizations improved by about $5.80 per barrel, in line withthe rise in spot BRENT prices. Lower liftings spread across multiple countries reflectedthe timing of cargos and reduced earnings by $240 million.  We were in a net under-lifted position in thethird quarter, which brings the year 2007 to a balance liftings position. Tax adjustments reduced earnings by about $80 millionbetween periods.  The variance in theother bar includes asset impairment charges. Turning to slide 7, slide 7 summarizes the change inworldwide oil equivalent production including volumes produced from oil sandsin Canada.  Daily volumes were down by 39,000 barrelsbetween quarters.  Maintenance-relatedshutdowns in the UK North Sea were the largest factor in this change.  George Kirkland will discuss productionvolumes in more detail in a moment. Turning to slide 8, our USdownstream results in the third quarter fell nearly $900 million from the priorquarter.  Margins were down $680million.  Both refining and marketingmargins fell, but the decline was particularly large for west coast refiningmargins.  Breaking out the $680 million,over 90% of that amount was refining margins, and over two-thirds of thatamount, in turn, was related to the west coast. Crude prices rose more rapidly than product prices during a period whenproduct inventories were ample. West coast margins also include an unfavorable variance infinal pricing adjustments for long haul crude. Lower refining volumes reduced third quarter earnings by $90 million,primarily due to a fire at our Pascagoula, Mississippirefinery in mid-August as well as other planned maintenance there. The unfavorablevariance in the other bar on this chart includes employee termination benefitsand provisions for litigation.  Both thesecond quarter and third quarter included environmental remediation charges inthis segment. Turning to slide 9, international downstream earnings of $487million were $30 million lower than the second quarter.  Released downstream margins dropped by about$275 million, in line with the change in indicator margins.  Asian refining margin indicators fell byone-third and indicator margins were sharply lower in Europeas well. As was the case in the US;the price of crude rose more rapidly than the price of refined products duringthe quarter.  These lower margins fullyoffset the gain on the sale of our fuels marketing business in the Beneluxcountries. The other bar on this slide includes asset impairment charges, lowershipping earnings and employee termination benefits. Looking at slide 10, this slide shows the chemicaloperations earnings in the quarter were $103 million, essentially unchangedfrom the prior quarter.  The results foroil sands improved due to higher ethylene margins and reduced utilitycosts.  Aromatics benefited from improvedstyrene earnings reflecting higher margins and increased volumes.  Aromatics also benefited from the absence ofan asset writedown we mentioned in the second quarter. The other bar includesan environment reserve provision in the third quarter. Slide 11 covers all other. Second quarter results included the $680 million gain on the sale of ourinterest in Dynegy, which was partly offset by $160 million of charges relatedto the early redemption of Texaco capital bonds. Similar to the second quarterthis segment includes about $70 million of environmental remediation expensesfor legacy Texaco and Unocal sites that have been closed or sold.  Third quarter net charges for this segmentfell at the high end of our standard guidance range of $160 million to $200million as we advised in our interim update. That completes a brief analysis of the quarter.  Back over to you Steve.\nStephen J. Crowe: Thanks, Jim.  Wewanted to use a portion of today\u2019s teleconference to give George Kirkland andMike Worth and opportunity to update you on our upstream and downstreambusiness developments respectively. We\u2019ll start with George.  He\u2019llturn things over to Mike and then we\u2019ll open it up for your questions.\nGeorge Kirkland: Thank you, Steve. I\u2019ll start on slide 13.  Before Iprovide you with an update of our major capital projects, I would like to reviewour 2007 production results.  This slidecompares our net OEG production through the first nine months of 2007 versusthe first nine months of last year. Although we are down 50,000 barrels a day this year, we can point out90,000 barrels of losses in 2007 that are attributable to our contractualchange in OPEC curtailments in Venezuela. Our production efforts this year have been focused onmanaging our base business declines and capturing gains from major capitalprojects that have recently come online. The low base business decline is a positive indicator of our basebusiness efforts. However, there are many moving parts in the base business --workovers, development wells, reliability and so on  -- and it\u2019s too early to say that our typical4% to 5% base decline rate has changed. Now I\u2019ll update you on some of our key projects.  Please turn to slide 14.  Let\u2019s start in the Gulf of Mexicodeepwater with our Tahiti project, where we have a 58%net working interest.  As a reminder, Tahitiis designed to have a production capacity of 125,000 barrels of oil per day and70 million cubic feet of gas per day. We have continued to progress this project by completinginstallation of export pipelines, completing five of the six development wells,and installing a significant portion of the sub sea production system and flowlines.  The spar hole is complete and thetop sides are near completion.  The holeand top sides will be ready for offshore installation once replacement mooringshackles and components are delivered and the rescheduling of the installationis finalized. A metallurgical problem with the original shackles wasidentified in June and installation activities were deferred in order to insurethat the facilities would be put in a safe and reliable operation. Installation of the truss spar is now scheduled to begin inthe first quarter of 2008.  The top sideinstallation, the mating with the spar, is targeted for the third quarter of2008.  First production is now expectedby the third quarter of 2009, approximately 12 months later than originallyplanned due to the shackle replacement and the installation rescheduling. Now let\u2019s turn to slide 15. We also continue to progress our Blind Faith project, located in the deepwaterGulf of Mexico. In July we purchased an additional 12.5% working interest in thisproject, bringing our total interest up to a 75% share.  The top sides have been lifted onto the holeand all three development wells have been drilled.  Positive results from the developmentdrilling supports the future drilling of a fourth well by 2009. Off shore installation and well completions are scheduled tocommence in November of this year, with first production expected by the secondquarter of 2008.  Blind Faith has aproduction capacity of 45,000 barrels of oil per day and 45 million cubic feetof gas per day. Now onto slide 16 where I will update the status of theAgbami Deepwater Nigeria project.  It\u2019sfloating production, storage and off-loading vessel has left the fabricationyard in South Koreaand is being towed to the offshore Nigerialocation.  This FPSO is the largest ofits type in the world and will be moored and ready for hook-up in the firstquarter of 2008.  It has a processingcapacity of 250,000 barrels of oil per day and a storage capacity of 2.1million barrels of oil. We have already drilled 11 producers and seven injectors.  We have two rigs working on the completionsof these wells.  We are on-track forfirst oil by the third quarter of 2008. We expect to be at full capacity within one year of start up.  As a reminder, Chevron has a 68% interest inthis project. Now turning to slide 17, I\u2019ll cover the Tengiz SGI/SGPproject.  We anticipate that sour gasinjection and the first production will begin in the fourth quarter of2007.  As a reminder, Chevron has a 50%working interest in TCO and the expansion start up, which we call Staged Oil,will enable us to increase production by about 90,000 barrels a day gross.  The second generation plant which is picturedhere should be fully operational by the second half of 2008.  This will add another 160,000 barrels ofproduction per day. The labor disruption of 2006 extended the constructionperiod but we have made great strides in keeping this project moving forward.  The combined SGI/SGP project has been one ofthe most complex and challenging, multi-billion dollar projects that Chevronhas ever led, and we are glad to see this project nearing its completion andstart-up. In the interim period between project start-up and theCaspian pipeline expansion, alternative rail export routes ensure we can exportthe full plant output. Now let\u2019s turn to slide 18. Production growth in the near term is all about the start-up and ramp-upof these highlighted major capital projects. Before I finish this morning, I wanted to cover other key milestonesthat occurred during the third quarter. The first two bullets further illustrate that our largequeue of opportunities are moving forward. Gorgon has passed a couple of very important milestones recently.  We received environmental approval from theWestern Australian Minister for the Environment in September, and FederalMinister for the Environment in October. Our engineering efforts are focusing on the permit conditions,modularization opportunities and execution planning. In Indonesiawe started up the DarajatIII geothermal project in July. This facility adds 110 megawatts to the West Javapower grid.  The Darajat facility now hasa total capacity of 260 megawatts. The next two items are examples of how we replenish ourdevelopment queue.  In August weannounced the Malange  oil discovery in block 14 deepwater offshore Angola.This well encountered more than 200 net feet of oil sands.  The well was tested at a rate of over 7,500barrels of oil per day of high quality crude. Future drilling is planned to assess potential reserves and assist inthe development design. In July, we reported the successful prevention test of theRosebank appraisal well, located some 100 miles Northwest of the Shetland Islands.  This well, in approximately 3,700 feet of water, flow-tested37 degree API light oil at restricted rates of 6,000 barrels of oil perday.  The appraisal and evaluationprogram should be completed by November of this year and will allow us todetermine the future work program and development of this discovery. We also recently announced our extension of the productionperiod for Thailandblocks 10 through 13.  By securing thisproduction extension we will now be able to move major investments forward onthe Platong II project.  Platong II isthe planned expansion of the existing Platong assets, which are currentlyproducing 250 million cubic feet a day and 40,000 barrels a day of hydrocarbideliquids.  Platong II will add gasprocessing capacity and enable our oil and gas projects to beaccelerating. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Worth: Thanks, George. Moving to slide 19, I would now like to update you on key downstreaminitiatives beginning with operational excellence. Improved reliabilitycontinues to be our top priority. We have resolved many high-risk conditionswhich have caused unplanned downtime. Despite these improvements, weexperienced significant crude unit fires this year at Richmondand Pascagoula. These incidentsremind us that we still have work to do, and have further strengthened ourresolve to improve reliability to enhance capabilities, processes andequipment. While the fire at Pascagoula was unfortunate, our incidentresponse was swift and effective, limiting the impact and preventing anyinjuries. We expect to complete repairs during the first quarter 2008. Thedemolition phase is proceeding safely. Critical equipment orders have beenplaced, and delivery is scheduled. We\u2019re taking steps to optimize conversionunit utilization while the crude unit is offline. As the left chart shows, lost utilization from unplanneddowntime this year has been slightly greater than in 2006, due to the two fires.However, we continue to drive down the number of unplanned outages, as shown onthe right. Incidents per quarter at our largest operated refineries have fallenmore than 50% since 2005. Since the first quarter turnaround, crude unit utilizationat Richmond has been consistentlystrong, averaging 101%. Our UK refinery has also operated very well the entireyear, also averaging 100% crude utilization. Conversion unit utilization atthese facilities has also been very strong. Turning to capital projects on slide 20, we are progressingwell in terms of achieving the major milestones we committed to earlier thisyear. During the quarter, our South Korean joint venture refinery completedconstruction of its [reside] upgrade project ahead of schedule and on budget.We expect the upgrade to lower crude costs by about $1 per barrel, increaselight product yield by 33,000 barrels per day, and add 15,000 barrels per dayof new lubricant base oil production. A new vacuum column, among the largest inthe world, and a new hydrocracker, lubricants base oil plant, and otherconversion units have begun commercial operations. On the west coast, we are currently modifying our El Segundocoker during a planned turnaround, to enable a shift to heavier and highersulfur crudes and to improve coker reliability. We expect to meet our productsupply commitments during the turnaround and to have the heavy crudeenhancements online by year end. We completed the Caspian blend integration product at our UKrefinery ahead of schedule and on budget. We now have the ability to feedCaspian blend crude at rates up to 40% of total feed.  This will provide an economic outlet forgrowing equity production. Finally, we announced sanctioning of the ContinuousCatalytic Reforming project at Pascagoula.  The new CCR will improve utilization andoptimize product yields.  Gasolineproduction at the refinery is expected to increases about 10% with completionanticipated by mid-2010.  In summary, weare ahead of schedule, or on track to complete the significant capital projectswe committed to bringing online this year. Moving to slide 21, we are also making significant progressin high grading our portfolio.  As youcan see from the map, we have made a number of divestments in the past twoyears on top of ongoing efforts to reduce the capital intensity of our brandedretail network. As you recall, back in March we announced our intent topursue divestments in Europe and Latin America.  We have followedthrough and succeeded in monetizing assets in businesses we no longer consideredstrategic.  In March, we sold our 31%interest in the Nerefco Refinery in the Netherlandsand other assets there, generating $1.1 billion in after-tax proceeds. Duringthe third quarter, we closed the sale of our fuels marketing business in Belgium,the Netherlandsand Luxembourgfor about $500 million in proceeds excluding a final adjustment expected byyear end. We also reached agreements to sell our proprietary, consumerand commercial credit card businesses. We believe these arrangements will enhance the payment products we offerour customers, while enabling us to maintain the strong brand loyaltyassociated with our cards. More portfolio improvement opportunities are being evaluatedand we\u2019ll share progress on these in the future.  We are working to create a more focusedfootprint for our marketing businesses. Fewer markets, but stronger positions in those markets will help usreduce costs and further improve returns on divested capital. Now I will turn it back over to Steve.\nStephen J. Crowe: Thanks, Mike.  Thatconcludes our prepared remarks.  We\u2019llnow take your questions, one question per caller, please.  Matt, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Dan Barcelo - Banc Of AmericaSecurities.\nDan Barcelo: Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for the update,particularly on the projects, it was quite useful. I wonder if you could spenda little bit on Gorgon. Having received a lot of the environmental approvals,could you talk a little bit about maybe the costs you are looking at now? Iknow it may be premature as you\u2019re still trying to cost and phase that, but anythoughts about how you\u2019d phase the development, and particularly on the costs forGorgon? Thank you.\nGeorge Kirkland: Dan, let me start off. I think you\u2019ve highlighted a lot ofthe points that we\u2019ve still got to address. In my comments I mentioned that weneed to go back and look at the permit conditions. We have a significant numberof permit conditions that we\u2019ve got to have mitigations fully vetted andunderstood how we would handle where we don\u2019t get into a cost issue during theconstruction stage. So we are presently back looking at all those conditions,and I would add one other area that we\u2019re really spending a lot of time on is themodularization. Remember we\u2019re building this on Barrow Island. We\u2019ve got theability to do a lot of modules and bring them in to minimize the actual work onthe island. That in many ways helps us, because the situation at the island,the constraints we have about moving equipment in there. We need to have areally good plan, and modularization will really help us there. Those are the items that we\u2019re really focusing on at thispoint in time. I expect I\u2019ll be able to talk quite a bit more about scheduleand where we are at our March analyst meeting, and at that point in time I willtry to really give a lot more details around the plan forward on Gorgon.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Leggate - Citigroup.\nDoug Leggate -Citigroup: Steve, the one-off items this quarter, I guess I\u2019m thinkingspecifically about refining marketing. You\u2019ve given us some breakdown on thelarger items, environmental mediation and so on, but it seems that there were quitea number of fairly significant items, particularly on the USdownstream. Could you go into a little bit more detail if you can on just toquantify that?\nStephen J. Crowe: Sure, I\u2019ll ask Jim to handle that. We anticipated that mightbe a question, since we kind of foreshadowed on our October 9th interim updatethat there would be a fair number of non-recurring items that affected theresults this quarter. So Jim?\nJim Aleveras: Doug, your question was with respect to the USdownstream?\nDoug Leggate -Citigroup: Well clearly across the businesses would be useful, but thatwas the one specifically where we saw a bit of a gap.\nJim Aleveras: Well in the USdownstream again, the effects were primarily margin-related.  If we look at the non-recurring chargesbetween the second and third quarter, there was not a significant difference inthat particular segment, in the US downstream segment.\nDoug Leggate -Citigroup: Then the absolute number this quarter is what I\u2019m trying toget, the absolute impact.\nJim Aleveras: The absolute number in the third quarter was about $50million negative.\nDoug Leggate -Citigroup: Okay.  Do you havethat for the other divisions?\nJim Aleveras: In terms of our segments?\nDoug Leggate -Citigroup: Yes.\nJim Aleveras: For the third quarter the USupstream, the non-recurring charges in aggregate were about $100 millionnegative.  For the internationaldownstream, the net non-recurring charges were about $250 millionnegative.  As I mentioned, for USdownstream it was about $50 million negative. For the international downstream, because of the gain on theBenelux assets, the change or the impact was a favorable$165 million.  I should point out that\u2019s$100 million less than the gain on the Beneluxassets.  So there was the gain on the Beneluxassets of plus $265 million and there were net non-recurring charges ofnegative $100 million. In the chemical segment, the impact was negative $40 million;and in the all other segment, the impact was about $100 million for a total of$400 million that we quoted in our earnings press release.\nDoug Leggate -Citigroup: The 121 employee termination and litigation, you\u2019re notterming that a one-off item in the U.S.?\nStephen J. Crowe: Yes we are, Doug, and it\u2019s not a large item but theseverances that were recognized in third quarter results were both in the United  States as well as international. Thanks very much for your question.  May we have the next question please?\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank.  Your question, please?\nPaul Sankey -Deutsche Bank: I want to ask a question about Indiabut if I could just make an observation further to Doug\u2019s point  -- I\u2019ll not phrase it as a question -- youhave in the earnings supplement a table of special items and other adjustmentsby quarter with nothing in it; but you\u2019re identifying $400 million ofspecials. Again, I don\u2019t want to use up my question on that but I dofind it slightly odd that there\u2019s zero reported within that table and I waswondering why that is, but if we could just...\nJim Aleveras: We won\u2019t count that as a question. So in the post Reg Gworld we live in, which goes back a few years now about making pro formaadjustments to GAAP earnings, these items were properly recognized in the thirdquarter.  They\u2019re event-driven as in thecase of sales or the recognition of impairments or severances and thelike. We don\u2019t view them, these happen for all large companies invarying degrees from period to period. We just felt there were enough of them that occurred in the quarter thatwe should highlight it for the analyst community in the interim update and inthe press release. It\u2019s really, then, left up to the individual analyst todetermine whether or not those should be taken out in order to get more of aclean earnings from your perspective. So, it\u2019s only that, Paul.\nPaul Sankey -Deutsche Bank: I just found it strange that.  In terms of India, could you just update usplease, in that you haven\u2019t mentioned it here amongst your major initiatives,could you just talk a little bit about the status of the expansion that you\u2019vegot going on there, firstly? Secondly, the timing and potential for you to expand yourposition.  Finally, a progress update onhow you\u2019re getting on with the upstream elements of that whole move that youmade there.  Thanks.\nStephen J. Crowe: Thank you, Paul.  Ithink I\u2019ll ask Mike to talk a little bit about the progress that we\u2019re seeingon the downstream side.\nMike Worth: I think there were three parts.  I\u2019ll take the first two and I\u2019ll hand theupstream one off to George.  The refineryconstruction is progressing very well. Over 97% of the engineering work is done and the construction is wellunderway.  I think the announced startdate for that refinery is 2008, and I fully expect that start-up to occur nextyear. Relative to our investment position, as you know we have a5% stake and subject to a number of other agreements being negotiated, theopportunity to increase that to 29%.  Wehave not concluded those other agreements and no decisions have been made as tothe ultimate decision relative to our equity share in that refinery. I\u2019ll ask George to comment on the upstream.\nPaul Sankey -Deutsche Bank: Could I just ask you the timing next year  -- you mentioned \u201808 obviously for therefinery --  that\u2019s presumably afirst-half event.  Secondly the timing,if you could just remind us on the increase on the stake when we\u2019ll get ananswer on that would also be interesting. Sorry to interrupt.  Thanks.\nMike Worth: I think the announced start date for the refinery isactually second half \u201808.  The timing forour final decision on our investment position is subsequent to the refinerystart-up.\nPaul Sankey -Deutsche Bank: Thanks.\nGeorge Kirkland: On the upstream issue, I would say we still have interest inthe KG Basin.  But, Paul, there\u2019s reallynot been much progress in really developing that opportunity.  So really it\u2019s nothing really to report atthis point in time.\nPaul Sankey -Deutsche Bank: Are there any initiatives that there might be something,George, that you could talk about?  Or wecan have more of an idea?  Thanks.\nGeorge Kirkland: Really nothing to talk about at this point in time.  Paul, it\u2019s just not ready and there\u2019s a lotof other people besides us that are interested in that.  So I really don\u2019t have anything to report.\nOperator: Ournext question is from Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse.\nMark Flannery: Yes.  My question isto George, and it concerns the decline rates. You said that it\u2019s too early to say whether or not the base decline of 4%to 5% is to be changed.  Could you justexpand a little on that, and tell us what kind of things specifically you\u2019redoing presumably to get that rate down obviously?  When do you think it would be appropriate totalk about a new decline rate in the upstream?\nGeorge Kirkland: I\u2019ll answer the last part of that question first.  I want some run time to see exactly how weare influencing it.  Specifically we\u2019vegot I think great processes where we in effect do base business audits aroundthe world and we audit from the reservoir through all the facilities.  We look at reliability.  We look at reservoir performance.  We look at the interactions between thesurface facilities and the subsurface facilities to make sure we don\u2019t have anybottlenecks.  We\u2019ve been on that process,for now about three years. It continues to turn up opportunities for us to optimize ourproduction around the world.  We areseeing some influence.  This first ninemonths of this year we\u2019ve had some great successes in South Texas with somedevelopment wells, which we used good seismic technology there, and had somegood results there.  We\u2019ve got some otherplaces where we\u2019ve focused on our water floods and we\u2019ve seen some declinerates shallow out. We\u2019ve got a lot of history of multiple years where this 4%to 5% decline rate is what we\u2019ve been typically seeing.  So I\u2019m encouraged by the first nine months,but I want a lot more run time and I am confident that the processes that we\u2019veput in place are going to help us for the long period improve our recovery andreduce our decline rates in greatest sense, but I think it\u2019s a little bit tooearly and that\u2019s why I made those comments that way.\nMark Flannery: George, would you characterize this as mostly EOR typestuff, or I mean are you spending more money on enhanced oil recovery or is asort of mix of things?\nGeorge Kirkland: It\u2019s a mix of things. It is not one focus.  We have fourto five areas that we really focus on; and in some places, we get it out ofjust system reliability, raising the reliability, the run times.  Some places it\u2019s hey, we find a facility thatwe can push more barrels through and we see that we\u2019ve got reservoir capabilityto match to it and not have to spend a lot of monies on facilities. So we\u2019re doing all those type things like, once again, fromthe reservoir through the sales point to try to optimize the system in all ourbusiness units around the world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Gilman - Benchmark.\nMark Gilman -Benchmark: Relating to Pascagoula,could you give an idea as to the size of the crude unit that is down? More generally, I guess I was a little surprised to see thesanctioning of the CCR project, and I\u2019m assuming that in having done so thedistillation expansion at Pascagoula which had been under evaluation is now nolonger on the table.  Could you commenton the validity of that observation?\nMike Worth: Yes, on the crude unit it\u2019s about 160,000 barrels per dayand on the CCR, that is an independent project. We\u2019ve got old fixed-bed reformers that need to have the catalystregenerated so we\u2019ve got to pull reformers offline for catalyst regeneration,and it significantly impacts our ability to get the utilization at the facilityup.  So this is a reliability projectthat has a very strong economic pay out, and frankly, there are not many ofthese fixed-bed reformers still in operation in the industry.  So it\u2019s really upgrading the technology tothe current state-of-the-art. The evaluation of other alternatives for Pascagoulacontinues.  I think I\u2019ve indicated thatwe would reach a final decision on that next year.  Certainly, you\u2019re seeing project economicschallenged in the refining sector on the Gulf Coast as well as the rest of theworld by the cost environment, by the questions about the margin environment,uncertainty about biofuels penetration and future demand, etcetera.  So we\u2019re factoring all those into our evaluationof alternatives, and we\u2019ll have more to say about that next year as that workis complete.\nMark Gilman -Benchmark: Mike, if I could just follow up on that. If you\u2019reconsidering an expansion, I don\u2019t know how you go about properly sizing whatthe replacement reforming capacity ought to be.\nMike Worth: Well on the reforming, it fits into a refinery that isconfigured with a number of other facilities that has streams that create feedfor the reformer. What we\u2019re doing is taking existing intermediate streams andwe are installing facilities that essentially you can look at as ade-bottleneck or a capacity creep kind of a project that enables us to morefully utilize the streams available within the refinery and increase theutilization.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Neil McMahon - SanfordBernstein.\nNeil McMahon: Maybe this is a quick one you don\u2019t have many answers for,but most of the impact on the refining in the US,the negative impact as you said was on the west coast. Just wanted to go intomaybe walking through some reasons for that, and did you have hedges in placesthere that could have caused some of those losses?\nMike Worth: As Jim showed earlier, when you compare the third quarter tothe second quarter, our USearnings were down nearly $900 million. More than two-thirds of that declinewas due to industry margins, and really the balance for the USwas due to lower volumes, and that is  primarilyPascagoula. So I think the quarter-to-quarter comparison is prettystraightforward on those two pieces. We have some pricing effects on our crudeoil into the refining system that we see most acutely at times of rapid changein crude prices, and our foreign crude that we purchase that is long-haul crudegets provisionally price while it\u2019s on the water, and so we\u2019ll see the effectof those increases before we actually capture the margin for running thatcrude. So we do have some paper effects that you see in anenvironment like this that are exacerbated by the amount of long-haul crudethat we run and the way that we price crude into our system.\nNeil McMahon: So you don\u2019t really do hedge accounting then on thoselong-haul crudes or in the west coast?\nMike Worth: We mark the pricing to current period pricing, and we runour refineries to capture the margin of the day, so we convert the pricing torun-month pricing, and so what that does result in is some open paper that is priceconversion off the feed stock to the run month.\nJim Aleveras: Let me just add on that point, again, as Mike said, thoseare part of the contractual provisions. They\u2019re not hedging, per se, so when a cargo is lifted it has acontractual term as to when it\u2019ll be priced so many days after lifting.  In a rising market, as we\u2019ve seen here in thethird quarter, that works adversely against us. Thank you very much for the question and the follow-up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Cheng - LehmanBrothers.\nPaul Cheng: Mike, if I look at the third quarter market conditions, GulfCoast 3 to 1 crack spread is roughly in the $11 to $12 per barrel and the Californiacrack is probably about $13, $14.  Whilethey advanced sharply from the second quarter, but they are really not that badfrom a historical standards standpoint. If you look at your earnings, I meanadjusting for the $50 million in environmental remediation charges and also the$90 million loss related to Pascagoula,you earned $30 million.  Is there astructural problem with your asset there then that your hardware just needs tobe revised sharply in order for them to be more sustainable in a more normalpricing environment?\nMike Worth: No, I don\u2019t think there is a structural problem in themarket or in the refinery.  I think theindicator margins did decline more sharply on the west coast than on the Gulf coastand with a skew to our downstream where we have more than half of our USrefining capacity on the west coast, that sharper decline will affect us to agreater degree.\nPaul Cheng: Mike, I\u2019m talking about on an absolute level that the crackis still topping out in the $10 to $15, which is not really that bad.\nMike Worth: Let me take another shot at building on the question thatNeil was asking.  We have these non-ratablepricing effects related to the change in crude prices which are most significantbecause the amount of long-haul crude that we bring into the west coast.  And so if you look at 3Q07 versus 3Q06 youwould see that the margin declines are not especially severe and the absolutelevel of margins, as you say, are not as extreme as the earnings delta mightindicate; but if you look at 3Q06, we saw crude prices drop by about $11 abarrel over the quarter. In 3Q07 we saw crude prices increase by $11 per barrelin the quarter, and so those non-ratable pricing effects have significantknock-on accounting effects that get unwound subsequently as we actually runthe crude, but in the quarter they create pronounced effects on our west coastdownstream performance.\nPaul Cheng: Mike can you quantify it for us?\nMike Worth: I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me to quantify that,Paul.\nJim Aleveras: You know, Paul, you\u2019re talking on average maybe 15 millionbarrels of long-haul crude on the water, and as Mike said in the earlier perioda year ago, we saw crude prices from beginning to end of the quarter drop by$11 a barrel, and just the reverse effect that occurred here in the thirdquarter. That is going to be a material impact on the comparison betweenadjacent years on a variance. it\u2019s one of the reasons why sometimes theindicative margin doesn\u2019t become realized for our company. Thanks for yourquestion.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch.\nJohn Herrlin: With Thailandyou said that you extended the contract. Are the terms still similar, or arethey higher for the country?\nStephen J. Crowe: Do we have similar terms? It\u2019s still the Taiwanterms. We do have some issues with related to how we extended it, but overallthe terms are basically the same.\nJohn Herrlin -Merrill Lynch: You were pretty active at the last Central Gulf sale. Could you give us asense on how many of the leases were Miocene versus, say Paleocene?\nStephen J. Crowe: I think my memory of the major targeted prospects, I believeit was nine or 11 intotal that we really captured major new prospects. All of them but one was thelower tertiary.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Gilman - Benchmark.\nMark Gilman: George, if you could, on Block 14 in Angola,could you tell me whether or not there are separate PSCs for each of thefields, and the extent to which there are rate of return thresholds built intothose production-sharing contracts, pursuant to which profit barrels and profitpercentages would step down once the threshold was reached?\nGeorge Kirkland: Mark, I\u2019m going to limit my comments a little bit, I willtell you that we have different development areas around each field.  Our development areas have typically in block14, been larger than what we had seen in the past and in some cases, they havebeen more or less brought together to allow cost recovery to be moved from onedevelopment to another.  So we have hadlarger development areas than in the past. I\u2019m not going to speak about the contractual pieces beyond that.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan.\nMichael LaMotte: A question related to upstream cost pressures, as yourspending is shifting more towards completion and production, are you seeing anychanges in the rate of change of cost there? I would think that completion inflation is probably not as high asdrilling in rigs, offshore rigs in particular.\nGeorge Kirkland: Let me take a shot at this one in a couple of ways.  First off, remember we are operating in 25 to30 countries around the world, we\u2019ve got a whole portfolio of projects that arein anything from the early phase, engineering to just about to start up andactually a lot of them in start up. The ones that are late in phase, we know contractual costsvery, very well.  Those projects are notseeing and have not seen the same movement in costs as projects in the earlyphases. I would tell you whether a project is an onshore project in North America or if it is an offshore project or a deepwater project,all of those in effect, change the outcome of the cost increases. I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples of what we\u2019ve seen andmaybe that will help you get a little bit of context.  We had a project in Angola, we brought onlinein deepwater project in Angola that we brought online a little over a year ago,we\u2019re doing a very similar project that\u2019s in the fabrication stage at thispoint, so we understand contractually what the cost is going to be fordrilling, for building of all the facilities, the installation, so we have gotthe contracts really nailed down. There\u2019s a five to seven-year difference in the life cycle ofthe two projects and when you compare project A to project B, we see almost a100% increase in the cost of doing the similar work.  So that\u2019s very typical in the deepwater whereyou\u2019ve seen rig rates go up.  Deepwaterrig rates have gone up two to threetimes over a five-year period. Other areas we are not seeing the same, and once again everyproject we look at individually because you\u2019ve got a different mix of contractsthat are either in place, and we have some period at a different rate than whatwe see in the future so we look at everything on a specific project-by-projectbasis. I would tell you one of the best areas to look at, maybe togive you a view of what the cost in the general industry what\u2019s happened therein the last probably five to seven years, is to look at the CERA, the CambridgeEnergy Research report that was published, I believe in the last year.  What it basically shows is over the periodfrom early 2000 to late \u201806, about 180% to 190% increase in their index.  So they\u2019ve shown a significant move in thatindex, and I think it\u2019s very indicative of the general industry.\nMichael LaMotte: Is there anything in the component cost that is leading youto think about redirecting capital on the margin?  Anything inflationary in the components sidethat would lead you to rethink project or redirect capital to better return?\nGeorge Kirkland: We do that.  I wouldtell you the one that\u2019s probably been impacted the most is shelf Gulf of Mexicowhere we made some decisions on changing how much capital we were spending onsome of our delineation and development wells there.  Rig rates had moved way, way up veryquickly.  If you look at the pricing sideof Henry Hub gas and you see the gas price has not moved; as a matter of fact,gas has moved down and oil has moved up. So we would have a bias there at this point in time to be oilier if wehave a choice.  We\u2019ve got some projectsbecause of the cost run-up on the services and the downturn on the gas price,that they are not really projects that are viable.  So they are put back on the shelf.\nJim Aleveras: In closing, let me say that we appreciate everyone\u2019sparticipation on today\u2019s call.   I especially want to thank each of theanalysts on behalf of all the participants for their questions during thismorning\u2019s session.  Matt, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s third quarter2007 earnings conference call."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-07-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Chevron\u2019s second quarter 2007 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Dave O\u2019Reilly. Please go ahead sir.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Welcome to Chevron\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. Today I\u2019m joined by Steve Crowe, Chief Financial Officer and Irene Melitas, Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron\u2019s financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2007 and I\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on the web. I\u2019ll remind you that today\u2019s presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements and ask that you review the Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Turning to slide 3. The company reported earnings of $5.4 billion in the second quarter, up 24% from the second quarter of 2006. Earnings of $2.52 per diluted share were up 28% from a year ago. The main drivers for the increase were first, a $680 million after-tax gain on the sale of our interest in Dynegy, partially offset by costs of $160 million from retiring on economic debt. Second, the absence of hurricane related charges for uninsured costs incurred in the second quarter of 2006; and thirdly, higher margins for refined products. Second quarter results were 14% higher than the first quarter, which Steve will discuss shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing four quarters was 24% and the debt ratio was about 10% at quarter end. Share repurchases totaled $1.75 billion, reflecting a higher buy back pace, which Steve foreshadowed at last quarters conference call. We now expect to complete the current buy back program in the third quarter. Steve will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks, Dave. My remarks compare second quarter results to those of the first quarter 2007. As a reminder, our earnings release compared second quarter 2007 to the same quarter a year ago. Turning to slide 4; second quarter net income was $665 million higher than the first quarter\u2019s result, driven by stronger commodity prices in the upstream and higher realized margins in downstream, particularly in refining. An increase in environmental remediation charges and a charge for the early redemption of Texaco capital bonds contributed negatively to the quarters results. Both items were highlighted in our interim update. The other bar reflects a negative variance in tax-related items and a net of everything else. Both periods had like-sized asset sales gains, the Nerefco sale in the first quarter and Dynegy in the second largely offsetting one another. Slide 5 summarizes the results of our U.S. substream earnings, which improved by about $425 million between quarters. Higher realizations particularly for liquids benefited earnings by $220 million between quarters. The $7.29 per barrel increase in crude realizations was generally in line with the increase on a composite of industry benchmark prices and contributed to a favorable $200 million variance between quarters. Improved natural gas realizations resulted in a $20 million profit effect. Though Henry Hub bid prices increased by $0.76 per 1,000 cubic feet, our average realizations rose $0.16 per 1,000 cubic feet reflecting our regional production mix and spot sales. Volumes including one additional producing day increased earnings by $30 million. Other primarily reflects a favorable variance in FAS 133 effects, lower exploration expenses and a gain on the sale of a couple of small operations. Turning to slide 6, international upstream earnings were $305 million higher than the first quarter\u2019s. Stronger oil prices benefited earnings by about $560 million and were partly offset by lower gas realizations. Unit Liquids realizations improved $10.17 per barrel, in line with the rise in spot Brent prices. Higher liftings in Canada, Bangladesh and Azerbaijani and other international locations resulted in a positive earnings variance of $120 million. The negative $70 million for litigation represents the absence of a favorable litigation settlement in the first quarter. The variance in other includes an unfavorable swing in tax-related items as well as higher operating and depreciation expense. Slide 7 summarizes the change in worldwide oil equivalent production, including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada. Daily volumes were down by 13,000 barrels per day between quarters with the larger changes by country noted on the slide. For the first six months of the year, our worldwide oil equivalent production averaged 2.640m barrels per day. We expect production for the second half of the year to be in line with the first. Turning to slide 8, U.S. downstream results in the second quarter exceeded the prior quarters by about $430 million. Higher realized margins benefited earnings by $390 million relative to the first quarter, reflecting stronger industry margins, particularly refining. Refining margins were partially dampened by inventory-related effects and an unfavorable variance in final pricing adjustments for long-haul crude. Marketing margins also improved the quarter\u2019s results. Refining volumes increased results by $135 million between quarters primarily due to the completion of the first quarter Richmond Refinery crude unit turnaround. The unfavorable variance in other largely reflects an increase in costs for environmental remediation as highlights in our interim update. Turning to slide 9, international downstream results of $517 million were lower than the first quarter\u2019s. Absent the first quarter\u2019s $700 million gain on the sale of our interest in the Nerefco Refinery, results were $56 million lower between quarters. Realized downstream margins improved earnings by about $150 million, primarily led by higher refining margins in most regions, in line with the rise in indicator margins. Lower volumes resulted in a decline of about $45 million between quarters reflecting, the fourth quarter Nerefco sale. Included in other is an swing in foreign exchange effects along with higher operating expenses reflecting increased maintenance and labor costs. Slide 10 shows earnings from chemicals were $104 million in the second quarter compared with $120 million in the first quarter. Results for olefins improved during the quarter due to higher ethylene and polyethylene margins and increased ethylene volumes. This was more than offset by an asset writedown in aromatics. Slide 11 covers all other. Second quarter results show a positive variance from the prior quarter arising from a gain on the sale of our interest in Dynegy which was partially offset by a charge related to the early redemption of Texaco capitol bonds, both of which were highlighted in our interim update. The variance in the other bar reflects and increase in environmental remediation expense for legacy Texaco and Unocal sites that have been closed or sold, tax related and other miscellaneous items. Absent the Dynegy gain and charge related to debt redemption, net charges for this segment fell within the guidance range of $160 million to $200 million provided in our interim update. That completes our brief analysis for the quarter. Back over to you, Dave.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Thanks, Steve. Turning to slide 12, we highlight some of the recent developments of the last few months starting with upstream. Last month we announced delay in our Gulf of Mexico Tahiti project due to some problems discovered in the facilities shackles. New shackles have been ordered and the timing of their installation is currently under review. At this time we have no further updates to provide regarding the completion date for these activities but will keep you apprised once we have a firm defined recovery plan in place. We have also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Venezuelan Government for the retention of our 30% interest in Hamaca. The MOU established the basic terms of the conversion and governance of the new joint venture company. Final conversion steps, including the National Assembly\u2019s approval and the issuance of a Presidential Transfer Decree, are expected later this year. In Europe, we successfully completed a production test of the Rosebank Appraisal well west of Shetland. Chevron holds a 40% interest in the Rosebank discovery and is the operator. A third appraisal well is expected to be completed later this year and the resulting data will determine a future work program for the discovery. On the downstream side, earlier in the quarter we disclosed that an extensive plan turnaround of our major crude distillation unit in the El Segundo Refinery was underway. That turnaround is now mechanically complete and the unit start up is under way. During the down time, certain work was performed to progress the heavy crude project which remains on track for year end completion. We also completed the sale of our fuels marketing assets in Uruguay and announced an agreement for the sale of the Benelux marketing assets in Europe. That transaction is expected to close during this third quarter and both transactions are part of our portfolio rationalization efforts highlighted during our March analyst meeting. Finally in May, as we mentioned earlier, we sold our interest in Dynegy. Our decision was driven by Dynegy\u2019s exits from oil and gas activities and the company\u2019s increasing focus on power generation, thereby minimizing the strategic fit with Chevron. That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll now take your questions, and one caller and one question per caller at a time, please. We\u2019ll try to wrap up at or before the top of the hour. So, Matt, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Dan Barcelo - Banc Of America.\nDan Barcelo: Regarding U.S. natural gas production, you mentioned in your press release that it\u2019s down about 7% year on year due to base decline. However, if I look over the last three quarters sequentially it seems the decline is a lot less. I don\u2019t know if you could give any further guidance on base declines for natural gas and even for oil which has actually been pretty flat, especially given the pull back for natural gas prices?\nIrene Melitas: We don\u2019t really assign a declined value to natural gas versus liquids. The guidance we\u2019ve previously issued is that overall our decline rate worldwide is about 4% to 5%, and in the U.S. it is higher, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 7%. But we don\u2019t otherwise provide a split between liquids and gas.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Citigroup. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: Production guidance for the balance of this year, perhaps looking ahead, can you just bring us up to date with where you see things. Just to be clear, Venezuela is not I guess really out of the equation in terms of the present mix, but do you see any other changes taking place in Venezuela that might impact your production that way, over the balance of this year in particular?\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Thanks, Doug. You know as I had mentioned in the aggregate for the enterprise, we see second half production largely the same as we had in the first; that is 2.640 million barrels a day or thereabouts. In the second half of the year we do anticipate some declines here in the United States as a result of normal field declines, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico. But, internationally, we expect to see some pick-up in Eurasia as a result of our TCO expansion that will be coming on later in the year, as well as a full six months of Bibiyana, where it came on line at the end of the first quarter this year. As far as the specifics on Venezuela are concerned for Hamaca right at this juncture the terms have not been made public so we won\u2019t comment on that particularly. But our projects are largely on track and as I said, we expect to be about the same for the full year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nArjun Murti: Thanks. My question is on some of the tax claims that have been filed by Russia related to the CPC that\u2019s at least been in the press. I realize the nature of these things are difficult to forecast outcomes and so forth, but just given the importance of your Tengiz project in Kazakhstan production, to the extent that you\u2019re not able to come to some sort of settlement with Russia do they have any reasonable recourse or actions that they can take or should we feel that since it is a separate country from Kazakhstan we shouldn\u2019t feel that the Tengiz or Kazak production is at risk for any reason related to these tax claims.\nSteve Crowe: Arjun, there have been some tax claims. By the way, these are not unusual; we get them all over the world, United States included, but let me just put them in perspective. The very first tax claim that we appealed, it went to the higher court. The higher court kicked it back down to the lower court. These are kind of I would say legitimate questions for tax authorities to ask that we need to resolve so that was an encouraging sign. So I expect that we\u2019re going to resolve these tax claims just like we do in other jurisdictions and it\u2019s a matter of interpretation of the tax code and sitting down and understanding one another and getting a resolution. Now having said that, with Tengiz of course we are also looking at other options; we\u2019re not solely dependent on CPC. We have a significant rail program, export program that we\u2019ve exercised in the past. As you remember, we operated Tengiz for five or six years without any CPC pipeline but we have many other options. We are also developing a southern route to take advantage of our participation in the Baku line so there are multiple options for exports here but I wouldn\u2019t get hung up on this tax case because I think it\u2019s just an example of something we have to work our way through.\nOperator: Your next question is from Paul Chang of Lehman Brothers. Your question please.\nPaul Chang: Dave, can you give an update on the status of our Gorgon, Agbami, and also the neutral zone contract expansion?\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Okay, Gorgon, Agbami and neutral zone; let me start with Gorgon. You\u2019ll recall that one of the big issues last year was getting government approval from the environmental perspective from the Western Australia government and the Western Australian government EPA had filed an objection. We worked our way through that and at the end of last year we were able to resolve those issues and objections from the EPA and gain the approval of the Western Australian government to go ahead with the project. Then there were two other issues remaining which we talked about in the spring at our March analyst meeting. The first was getting federal government approval or the commonwealth government technically, approval for the environmental permits there. That process is still underway and is not complete but I am confident that we\u2019re going to get completion there and we\u2019re working hard to get it there. The other issue was the question of costs and the cost escalation that we\u2019re seeking in the whole L&G supply chain: Fabrication, contractors, construction, and et cetera. That led us to go back and work with our partners late last year and we\u2019re continuing that work, although we should be wrapping it up this year. It caused us to go back with our partners and look at trying to come up with alternatives and optimization for the construction plan and facilities; different configurations. That work is underway. We\u2019re working with our partners. This is an enormously big project. It\u2019s very important from a capital storage perspective to get it right. So we\u2019re looking at a facility that\u2019s going to be on the ground for decades and producing very, very copious quantities of gas. We want to get it right, we\u2019re working our way through it. When we get it right, we\u2019ll move forward with it. But that work is still underway. That\u2019s Gorgon. You asked two other questions, although you were supposed to ask one.\nPaul Chang: It\u2019s all in one question.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: I know, yes. Agbami; Next month I\u2019ll be in Korea visiting the FPSO, which is nearing completion. It\u2019s one of the largest ever built, the size of an aircraft carrier I\u2019ve been told. So I\u2019m looking forward to seeing it. It\u2019s going to sail later this quarter, early in the fourth quarter. So everything is online with Agbami. The third question you asked was the neutral zone. We are in the process of renegotiating or negotiating an extension or amendment to the neutral zone agreement, which has been in place from 1949 and through different successor companies and it\u2019s too early to predict the outcome, other than to say that we are currently engaged and over the next year or so we hope to get that issue resolved. But it\u2019s too early to say yet. It\u2019s early days of the negotiation. Thank you. I will take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nicole Decker of Bear Stearns. Your question please.\nNicole Decker: Good morning. My question is on the share buyback program given that you aim to complete your authorization next quarter I am interested in hearing your thoughts on the likelihood of an extension or a renewal?\nSteve Crowe: As Dave mentioned we anticipate completing the currently $5 billion authorized program in the third quarter. That would amount to $1.9 billion and we fully expect that our board will authorize a follow-on program right behind it. As indicated, we\u2019ve been ramping up the repurchase program given the current market conditions and our debt profile with $1.75 billion here in the second quarter and as I mentioned 1.9 billion in the third quarter. So thanks very much, but that can be your expectation. May we have the next question?\nOperator: Our next question is from Bruce Lanni of AG Edwards. Your question please.\nBruce Lanni: Just a follow-up question somewhat dealing with Paul Chang. Gulf of Mexico; I tuned in a little bit late, you may have covered it. But can you give us an update on the sanctioning there as well as any status or comments on Jack and Bob North?\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Let me just kind of give you an overview of the Gulf of Mexico in general. I covered the Tahiti issue earlier in my opening remarks and we have no firm plan yet for recovery other than we\u2019ve ordered replacement shackles and we\u2019re still working on a recovery plan there. Blind Faith; the hull has been delivered to the Gulf. By the way the Tahiti hull is in the Gulf. So it\u2019s not a question of the hull, it\u2019s a question of getting the shackles manufactured and coming up with a new program for installation. It\u2019s much too early to predict what timeframe that can occur. On Blind Faith the hull has been delivered into the Gulf of Mexico and that\u2019s looking on track. Jack and St. Malo, you recall last year, we completed a extensive record setting test on Jack and we have an appraisal program planned for both St. Malo on a continuation of the appraisal of Jack during 2008;, not during 2007, so you will not hear more from us this year, other than to say there\u2019s more appraisal underway and that will lead to a much better understanding in \u201808 and beyond that, who knows. We\u2019ll be developing some sort of a development plan to move forward, but that is the timeframe for those two. On Tubular Bells, we\u2019re still working with the operator on that to develop further appraisal and it\u2019s too early to predict yet, but the ultimate development is there, but I\u2019ll refer you to the operator on that one. Was there another question?\nBruce Lanni: Bob North.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: I believe we have a well in our program currently with Bob North and so we\u2019ll perhaps have more to say about Bob North later this year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Neil McMahon of Sanford Bernstein. Your question please.\nNeil McMahon: Just on Jack again, actually, it looked like there was a delay on the next appraisal well on Jack, and I believe at the investor presentation earlier in the year, you were not planning to test that appraisal well, but given the fact that it\u2019s been delayed into 2008, are you now going to test that next appraisal well and maybe you could provide sort of an ongoing description of how you\u2019re finding the reservoir characteristics based on the work you\u2019ve done so far.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Let me go back and be very precise because we were very careful about what we said. We said we do our next appraisal well at Jack either late this year or early next year. What I\u2019m saying now is it\u2019s going to be early next year, not late this year. It is unlikely that we\u2019ll need to test that well, but it will help us characterize the scope of the reservoir, and beyond that I\u2019m not prepared to make any other predictions. St. Malo, I don\u2019t know we\u2019ve made a decision yet as to whether we\u2019re going to test the St. Malo well, a lot of it depends on what we find in the next appraisal well, so it\u2019s too early to tell what we\u2019ll do there. One of the great advantages here is now we\u2019ve merged our predevelopment teams because this is the benefit of a merger between Chevron and Unocal because Unocal was the operator at St. Malo, we\u2019re the operator at Jack. Now we\u2019ll be able to merge the technical teams that are working on this and I think we\u2019re trying to optimize our plans here so that we transfer learning things from one to the other and take the most efficient approach to developing this new trend in an economic way. So early days yet, more work to come, but we\u2019re very satisfied with the progress we\u2019ve made to date.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company. Your question please.\nMark Gilman: I was wondering if you could provide just a little bit more clarity and granularity on the heavy crew projects in El Segundo and Yeosu in Korea in terms of what units in particular you\u2019re putting in, the size, the cost and what the yield implications will be?\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Let me just give you a general review on El Segundo first. We tried to cover some of this in the March meeting. The El Segundo work really requires a lot of work in two areas. It requires a facility to be installed in our major crude unit, which is currently underway and actually just about wrapped up as I mentioned in my formal remarks. The second phase of the construction work revolves around the coker because we need more coking capacity and more efficient coking capacity and construction work is already underway but it will be conducted and completed during the coker turnaround that we had scheduled in the fourth quarter this year. So the plan is to have it all wrapped up. In the case of Yeosu, it is actually so that the El Segundo is in the hundreds of millions sort of range. Now the Yeosu project is a $1.5 billion and that involves some new facilities, dehydrogenation facilities, as well as at the back end of it, a new base oil plant, the ability of the plant and the capacity of the plant to convert heavier crudes, that will complete by the end of the year and that\u2019s on track. The lube oil plant is expected to start up in the second quarter of next year. It lags behind the basic plan itself. So that\u2019s generally the scope of the 2 projects. The one in Yeosu is quite much more significant and we\u2019ll be covering that in more detail in one of our upcoming calls or perhaps in our big analyst meeting early next year. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robert Kessler - Simmons, your question please.\nRobert Kessler: Dave, I don\u2019t really expect you to speak on behalf of other oil companies but any reason as to why you\u2019re sticking around in Venezuela despite Exxon and Conoco having taking Chavez to court effectively.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Well, first of all we\u2019ve been there a long time. Since the 1940s originally, but first let me mention a couple of things. We were able to successfully convert our Boscan operation to a joint-ventured company last year and in the process of doing that, preserve value and come out of it in what we think was a satisfactory conclusion. We believe that we have the same opportunity here at Hamaca, and I can\u2019t speak for other companies other than to say that we wouldn\u2019t be making this choice if we didn\u2019t think it was the right choice for Chevron, and we are confident that under the circumstances we can complete, well the negotiations are complete, but get approved by the authorities so we can continue to operate there. But I think in your question you almost implied part of the answer. You should put that question to some of the others as well.\nRobert Kessler: Any thoughts about a future heavy oil project, in addition to Hamaca at this point?\nDave O\u2019Reilly: No, I think our focus right now is on restructuring our current operations there, and we just have to see how we\u2019re treated there, what the opportunities are in the future and our decisions to go further there are entirely dependent on our experience with the operations that we\u2019ve already converted and are in the process of converting. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Gilman - Benchmark, your question please.\nMark Gilman: I\u2019m having an awful lot of difficulty with the transparency in the release, regarding there are indicated to be no special items, but as we go through the discussion there seems to be quite a number. I was hoping you could quantify the asset sales in U.S. E&P, the environmental provisions, and refining and marketing, and to what extent those provisions are included in the $150 million number that is indicated in the waterfall chart regarding overall earnings, and also the asset writedown in foreign E&P?\nSteve Crowe: Thank you, Mark. We don\u2019t disclose special items, because we no longer view it as special items given the size of our firm. But the things that we\u2019ve disclosed in the press release and foreshadowed in the interim update are I think some of the key things if you were making some adjustments you could take into account. Certainly the largest among those would be the gain connected with our sale of the Dynegy shares. Similarly in the same segment we indicated that there was a charge in connection of the redemption of some uneconomic Texaco capital bonds, which we reacquired here in the second quarter. Those two might be things you could pull from our report of results.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: I would like to build a little bit on it, Steve is right on the mark, you know, we are not going to dig into the ups and downs, because every quarter there are ups and downs, let me give you one example. We see environment charges come pretty much every year, now they come in lumps; some quarters there are fewer and some quarters there more, this quarter they are some what more than we\u2019d experience, for example, in the first quarter. But it varies and I think you\u2019ve go to expect that these things are ongoing, so we treat them as a part of our ongoing business. I think from an analyst perspective the best way to view our earnings is to look at them and then if we see things we truly believe are unique and that do not belong in routine business, such as the two items that Steve cited, I think those we will continue to highlight. But others I think you\u2019ve got to take into the ongoing business environment and they are lumpy, slightly up sometimes, down other times. If there is something that we believe is a significant factor, that we think you ought to take into account, we are going to tell you about it. And that is why we highlighted these two items that we did in the second quarter. I think we are about ready to wrap up, so I would like to thank you all for participating in the call. Please let Irene or our team know if you have any follow-up questions. I look forward to talking to you in future quarters or future meetings. Thank you for your interest in the company. Good bye."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-04-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Matt, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2007 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Steve Crowe. Please go ahead, sir.\nSteve Crowe: Thank you, Matt. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call. Today, on the call, I am joined by Irene Melitas, Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2007. We'll refer to the slides that are available on the web. I remind you that today's presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements and ask that you review the Safe Harbor statement on slide two. I'll begin with slide 3, which provides an overview of our financial performance. The company reported earnings of $4.7 billion for the quarter or $2.18 per diluted share. Earnings were up 18% from the first quarter a year ago, reflecting a $700 million after-tax gain on the sale of our interest in the Nerefco Refinery in the Netherlands and higher margins on refined products worldwide. These benefits were partially offset by the effect of lower prices for crude oil and natural gas on upstream profits. First quarter results were 25% higher than the fourth quarter of 2006, which Irene will discuss shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing four quarters was 23%. And the debt ratio was about 12% at quarter end. Earlier this week, we announced an 11.5% dividend increase raising our quarterly dividend to $0.58 per share. 2007 marks the 20th consecutive year that the company has increased its annual dividend payout. Share repurchases totaled $1.25 billion, the same quarterly pace as in 2006. Slide 4 highlights some of the milestones we achieved in recent months, starting with upstream. Last month, we announced the start-up of our Bibiyana natural gas field in Bangladesh. The field is initially expected to produce 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day rising to 500 million cubic feet per day by 2010. This exploration success continues with the announcement of two deepwater oil accumulations in the northern part of the Republic of Congo Moho-Bilondo permit. Chevron's non-operated interest is 31.5%. Evaluation and development options studies are underway. In the downstream, we announced the sale of our 31% interest in the Nerefco Refinery in the Netherlands. The transaction closed at the end of March, and was part of our portfolio rationalization efforts highlighted during the March analyst meeting. Irene, will now take us through the quarterly comparisons. Irene?\nIrene Melitas: Thanks, Steve. My remarks compare first quarter results to those of the fourth quarter 2006. As a reminder, our earnings release compared first quarter 2007 to the same quarter a year ago. Turning to slide 5; first quarter net income was about $940 million higher than the fourth quarter results. First quarter earnings benefited by $700 million from the sale of our interest in the Nerefco Refinery in Europe, as indicated in our interim update for the quarter. Volume effects reduced earnings by $175 million and were primarily attributable to lower liftings in Canada and production in the US. A decrease in exploration expense contributed favorably to the quarters results. The other bar reflects a positive swing in tax related items, lower operating expenses, and the net of everything else. Slide 6, summarizes the results of our US upstream earnings, which declined by $90 million between quarters. The benefit of higher natural gas realizations were partially offset by lower liquids realizations, and netted to a $20 million improvement in earnings. The $1.38 per barrel decrease in crude realizations was generally smaller than the decrease in industry benchmark prices. While the average price for WTI declined by $1.89 per barrel between quarters. The Gulf of Mexico benchmark trade month price, which is on a lagged basis, declined by about $0.95 per barrel Higher natural gas realizations resulted in a $50 million profit improvement. Though Henry Hub bid-week prices improved by $0.24 per thousand cubic feet, our average realizations improved $0.50 per thousand cubic feet, reflecting our regional production mix and spot sales. Volume effects associated with third-party pipeline disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico and San Joaquin Valley and two fewer producing days reduced earnings by $65 million. Other primarily reflects an unfavorable variance in FAS 133 effects, which was partially offset by lower exploration expenses and other items. Turning to slide 7; international upstream earnings were about $90 million higher than the fourth quarter. Lower oil prices reduced earnings by about $35 million, and were partially offset by higher gas realizations. Unit liquids realizations declined by $0.62 per barrel, less than the drop in spot brand prices due to country mix effects. Lower liftings in Canada resulted in a negative earnings variance of $100 million. A decrease in exploration expenses benefited earnings by $155 million. The variance in other includes lower operating expenses between quarters. Slide 8, summarizes the change in worldwide oil equivalent production including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada. Daily volumes were down by 12,000 barrels between the quarters. During the first quarter, US production declined 14,000 barrels per day due to third-party pipeline disruptions affecting the Gulf of Mexico and San Joaquin Valley and natural field declines. Outside the US, oil and gas production was relatively flat between quarters. Production increases in the United Kingdom reflect the absence of downtime at Britannia during the fourth quarter. This increase was offset by lower production in Canada due to unplanned downtime at Hibernia. Turning to slide 9, US downstream results in the first quarter were slightly higher than the prior quarters. Lower realized margin effects of about $85 million adversely impacted earnings relative to the fourth quarter. This was primarily due to the affects of the Richmond refinery crude unit turnaround, which was extended by repairs associated with the fire. The unit was down for most of the quarter, which prevented the company from capturing the improved West Coast refining margins. Refining margins were also dampened by supply effects during the quarter. Marketing margins were lower on the West Coast. Weaker asphalt and lubricants margins also affected the quarter's results. Somewhat offsetting these lower margin affects were improved refining and marketing margins in the East. The other variance includes lower expenses at the Pascagoula refinery following the fourth quarter's FCC shutdown and expansion project and other miscellaneous items. Turning to slide 10, international downstream earnings of about $1.3 billion were substantially higher than the fourth quarter. The sale of our interest in the Nerefco refinery, and associated assets in the Netherlands resulted in an after-tax gain of $700 million. Absence the sale, results were about $40 million lower between quarters. Realized downstream margins improved earnings by about $50 million led by higher refining margins in most regions, in line with the rise in indicator margins. An unfavorable swing in foreign exchange effects reduced earnings by $90 million and drove the variance in other. Slide 11 shows earnings from chemicals were $120 million in the first quarter compared with $124 million in the fourth quarter. Results for olefins declined during the quarter, primarily due to lower ethylene margins and higher manufacturing costs related to plant turnarounds. The improvement in additives earnings reflects the combination of higher margins, and lower non-manufacturing expenses. Slide 12 covers all other. First quarter results show a positive variance from the prior quarter due to higher earnings associated with the company's investment in Dynegy, included in the P&L business' bar and as mentioned in our interim update guidance, favorable corporate tax items included in other. Largely as a result of the variance in tax items, net charges for segment Other were lower than our standard quarterly guidance for this segment at a range of $160 million to $200 million excluding Dynegy. That completes our brief analysis for the quarter. Back over to you, Steve.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks, Irene. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now take your questions, one question per caller, please. We'll wrap up at or before the top of the hour. Matt, please open the lines for questions. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Dan Barcelo of Banc of America. Your question please.\nDan Barcelo: Yes. Good morning.\nSteve Crowe: Hey, Dan.\nDan Barcelo: Regarding to me, you had an impact obviously in the first quarter from Richmond. I didn't know, if you could just further quantify for us a bit some of the non-recurring operational impacts for first quarter for the downstream relative to just the refining margin impacts or other environment impacts?\nSteve Crowe: Sure. Thanks, Dan. Just for a little bit of background, as Irene mentioned, we had a fire that occurred at the Richmond refinery in mid January at the crude unit. Just as that was being brought down for schedule maintenance. We had a failure of a swing out [wash oil pipe spool]. But as I mentioned, there was a plant turnaround being readied and so our supply position already anticipated the unit being out of service. The fire itself extended the shutdown by about a month and the refinery was back by the end of the first quarter. From an analytical perspective, if you try to get an estimate of the cost of the incident including the lost profit opportunity as well as the additional repair costs, then it's probably on the order of about $150 million or so. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Citigroup. Your question, please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Irene.\nSteve Crowe: Good morning, Doug.\nIrene Melitas: Good morning.\nDoug Leggate: The tax in the quarters, Steve, I think Irene alluded a little bit there in the comments. But it was obviously a bit lower than your guidance, I guess. Can you just walk us through some of the major items there and just reiterate perhaps what you expect the run rate to be for the balance of the year?\nSteve Crowe: Sure. Thank you, Doug. The first quarter effective tax rate was 37.6% and if you look at the average effective tax rate for full year 2006, it was more on the order of 46%. So Doug as you pointed out, it was considerably lower than last year. And looking at the components as to why our average effective tax rate is lower in the first quarter for a 90-day period, I'd point to three things. Number one, we had a lower tax rate associated with the Nerefco sale, certainly a non-recurring item from a run rate perspective. Number two, we have some favorable adjustments for prior periods resulting from the completion of tax audits. And number three, in the first quarter, proportionately more income was earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Clearly, we operate in many taxing jurisdictions. So, as they shift from location to location, you can get some noise on that score. With respect to the favorable adjustments for prior periods as Irene mentioned, we try to at least reference this in the April 10th interim update. In that interim update, we spoke about all other segment. We said, for the first quarter, favorable tax-related effects at the corporate level are expected to substantially offset corporate charges for the period. So, given the earlier guidance that should have given some indication that we were going to be getting a favorable tax benefit. But those three components explain roughly the 10% decline or 9% decline from sort of an average run rate. As to your question, what might be an average rate? I think, the rate that we saw in 2006, is pretty representative. Again, there will be noise that occurs when we have adjustments as a result of completion of tax audits. And there will be noise to the extent that you have transactions that result in tax rates different than that average. Thanks very much for you question, Doug. I hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ron Oster of A.G. Edwards. Your question please.\nRon Oster: Good morning Steve. Had a quick question on Gorgon, I was wondering if you could give us an update in terms of any progress that's been made there regarding the development type or any contract sales? If you could just kind go over some of the major hurdles that need to be overcome before it to be sanctioned? And any timeframe on sanction would be helpful?\nSteve Crowe: Thank Ron. We covered this at last months New York, Analyst Meeting. But for the benefit of those who may not have heard that, let me give a little bit of background. Gorgon is a project of great scale and complexity. And certainly, we're dealing with increasing market-related costs. Gorgon is presently in the engineering and design phase. You may recall, last December, we received concurrence on the environmental framework for two-train LNG facility on Barrow Island, which was given by the Western Australian government. We are now awaiting the final environmental permits from the Western Australia government and the Common Wealth. Which we expect will occur around mid-year. During the last several months, we've undertaken additional studies to reduce costs, consider appropriate production capacities, and try to mitigate any uncertainty with respect to the execution before we make a final investment decision. But the project is moving forward, and the first hurdle that we need to get past is the environmental permit, which I mentioned we hope to see in the not too distant future. As was indicated in the slides, that we showed at the Analysts Meeting last month, start-up is expected after 2010. It's difficult for me to give anything more precise at this stage of the game until some of these milestones are completed. But I thank you for your question, Ron.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse, your question please.\nMark Flannery: Yes, thanks. My question is on Kazakhstan and Tengiz, in particular. Can you just update us what we expect to see from that project as we go through the year? Any maintenance or ramp ups, ramp downs that kind of things?\nSteve Crowe: Thank you, Mark. Again, this was a project that George Kirkland discussed at last months Analysts Meeting. But, let me give just a little bit of a backdrop here on this phased expansion at TCO. The sweet gas injection came on in the latter part of 2006. This year, we've tested it and established the sustained injection rates and pressures, and the mechanical operation of the facilities. Later in 2007, we expect the Sour Gas Injection to commence and staged oil will increase. Once fully online in 2008 as the project ramps up, we see Tengiz gross production capacity increasing from levels in the neighborhood of 285,000 barrels a day to a range of 460,000 to 550,000 barrels a day, once it is fully online. So, it\u2019s moving ahead, and we will continue to update you with respect to the project as information becomes available. Thanks very much, Mark.\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers, your question please.\nPaul Cheng: Hi Steve and Irene. Good morning.\nSteve Crowe: Hi, Paul.\nIrene Melitas: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Just a quick one, it seems that you update Gorgon. Can you give us an update on Nigeria and Angola on the LNG project to see where we are in terms of sanctioning those projects? Thank you.\nSteve Crowe: Thank you, Paul. Those projects are earlier in their development. The Angola LNG project in which we own about 36% equity is still in feed that is the engineering and the front-end engineering and design phase. It is progressing with the collaboration of our partners, and we expect FID, later this year. As to the Nigeria LNG project, the Olokola I, it too was in feed with engineering and design work underway. It\u2019s a little bit further back than the Angola I. But we will keep you apprise as it progresses. That's the current status Paul. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Gilman of Benchmark, your question please.\nMark Gilman: Guys, good morning.\nSteve Crowe: Good morning, Mark.\nIrene Melitas: Good morning, Mark.\nMark Gilman: Wondering to see if I could get a little bit more clarification on the international downstream earnings, knowing that, that segment contains a number of what I would consider to be non-refining and marketing activities including shipping, including CPC, including the petrochemical interest in Korea with LG. I also noticed in that variance analysis, there was no mention one way or the other of the potential absence of the fourth quarter LIFO benefit that favorably impacted those results. So, if you could clarify that first quarter result in that segment, drill down a little bit, I would appreciate it?\nIrene Melitas: Thanks Mark. You asked about some of the other contributing factors to our international downstream earnings, for example, shipping and so forth. Shipping was actually down between quarters on account of fewer liftings and lower freight rates. The earnings contributed from the Sasol JV were positive between quarters. Trading margins were higher between quarters, and clearly the biggest driver as far as other items relates to foreign exchange, which was a negative variance between the two quarters. Inventory related effects, I do not have that specifically isolated at this time. We can certainly get back to you after the call.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks Mark, you are quite right to say, it\u2019s a very large business with lots of components in it. And making it simplified for these bar charts, we do take a lot of things that get netted together. Thank you very much. May we have the next call please?\nOperator: Your next question is from Bernie Picchi of Wall Street Access. Your question please.\nBernie Picchi: Yes. Good morning, Steve and Irene. It was interesting and pleasing to see that you had a 5% increase in branded gasoline sales in the US in the quarter. I was a little surprised by that given kind of what's happened to gasoline prices. Can you give us any color on what may or how it should be happening region by region and also within the quarter and if you can go out into the beginning of the second quarter? Are you seeing a continuation of that trend? Is it going to falling-off on acceleration or what's going on?\nSteve Crowe: Thank you, Bernie. The main driver that we've seen in our increase in volumes associated with branded gasoline here in the United States has been the expansion associated with the Texaco brand. As we got a full use of that, we've expanded the brand both in the Southeast and now more recently on the West Coast. So, that's been a key contributor for the increasing sales of branded gasoline that we've seen here in the United States. And as you can imagine, that's a very favorable development from our perspective. As far as I know, Bernie, we don't see any thing that suggests that will not continue. Thanks very much. May we have the next call?\nOperator: The next question is from Oswald Clint of Sanford Bernstein. Your question please.\nOswald Clint: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just one question on exploration please. Given, there are very successful exploration discoveries quarter today than actually over the last couple of years, is there any potential for the rest of the year for a step up in drilling activity or some extra exploration wells to be drilled over the course of 2007?\nSteve Crowe: Well, as we had talked about at our January call, we see the exploration activity essentially on par with that of last year. We've just had tremendous success with exploration, as you know. And over the last five years, our success rate has been industry leading at 45%. I don't have any specific new information with regards to the exploration program, but it is something that we are very proud of and it had a tremendous track record on. Perhaps, we can get you some more detail if you follow up with Irene a little later.\nIrene Melitas: I would actually also recommend that you refer to the presentation by Bobby Ryan back in March and in one of the slides, it actually provides in great detail what our program is for 2007.\nSteve Crowe: Thank you, Irene. May we have the next call?\nOperator: Our next question is from of John Herrlin of Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nJohn Herrlin: Yeah. Hi. Looking upstream at your CapEx, you are up 26% versus first quarter of last year, but down 21% versus fourth quarter. I am just trying to get a sense of what you are spending on there? Are these lumpy changes because of all the development stuff you are doing with things like at (inaudible) and Tahiti or is it because of exploration activity?\nSteve Crowe: Thank you, John. Certainly, our C&E pattern is influenced by the timing of these large projects that you've heard so much about. We monitor the capital program very, very closely. Sort of on a naive basis, if you look back for several years for Chevron, our spending tends to be backend loaded to the second half of the year. The $4.1 billion spend through the first quarter in the aggregate that includes R&M and other as well, is right in line with our historical pattern of spending about 20% to 21% of the full C&E amount in the first quarter. So, I think your perception is correct. It's driven largely by the timing of these projects.\nJohn Herrlin: Thanks.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks very much, John.\nOperator: Our next is from Jason Gammel of Prudential. Your question please.\nJason Gammel: Good morning, Steve and Irene.\nSteve Crowe: Good morning, Jason.\nIrene Melitas: Good morning, Jason.\nJason Gammel: With the Richmond incident now largely behind you, can you provide us with any guidance about the progress on capturing the reliability refinery within the system, maybe in terms of utilization ranges that we could expect to see for the remainder of the year based on what you know about scheduled maintenance?\nSteve Crowe: Well, as we would have mentioned at last month's analyst meeting, we are spending a lot of time on process and equipment and people in trying to create that reliability refinery. Running the refineries with excellence is a very cost effective way of increasing earnings for our shareholders. As Mike would have mentioned last month, 2007 has a particularly heavy turnaround. As I mentioned, there was a turnaround at the first plant turnaround in the first quarter at Richmond, and we have other plant turnarounds that occur here in the United States and overseas. For competitive reasons and commercial reasons, we don't describe the timing of those things until they are completed. But they will influence the metrics when you look at crude utilization. However, they are well planned for and the downstream units are up and running. And so, we will continue to progress our efforts towards improving reliability. It is a key focus for our downstream business and we expect to see continued progress just as we had done in 2006. But thanks for the question very much, Jason.\nIrene Melitas: And Jason, if I may add one more thing, just a data point here. The number of outages for the last six months was about 40% lower than the prior six months. So, I think that speaks to our ongoing progress and the reliability arena.\nSteve Crowe: Thank you. May we have the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers, your question please.\nPaul Cheng: Hi, Steve and Irene. I just had a follow-up. When I was looking at your share buyback, it's about $1.25 billion a quarter and if you are looking at your cash flow generating capability and your cash on hand. Is there any reason that company do not want to increase the run rate to a more substantial?\nSteve Crowe: Thanks Paul. The cash on hand at the end of the first quarter included the proceeds from the Nerefco sale which were received as the clock struck midnight on March 31st. Absent of that, the cash balances at the end of March relative to the end of the year were nearly the same. As I pointed out, we spent $1.25 billion for share repurchases in the first quarter. Given the cash balances that we have now and our cash generation capacity, along with the strengthening of commodity prices, it's highly likely that we'll increase the pace of our repurchase program here in the second quarter. But we look at the repurchase program as an appropriate use of our cash in excess of operating needs and our capital program. But first and foremost, we have such a wonderful queue of projects we want to make sure we fund the growth for our shareholders by making sure that those projects are well funded. Over the last three years or so, we've used the share repurchase program as a way of balanced capital realignment as we've reduced debt and reacquired equity. It is however, even from an investment point of view quite apart from capital structure, an attractive investment for excess cash for our shareholders, as we're purchasing reserves at rates that are under $10 a barrel. So, I think you can expect a step up in the repurchase rate in the second quarter. Thanks very much, Paul\nPaul Cheng: Steve. Can I stay in with additional question?\nSteve Crowe: Sure.\nPaul Cheng: You talked about the branded sales gasoline sale up because of Texaco. Can you share with us some market intelligence, in your network, what is the same store sales you offered here for those stores that have open more than 12 months?\nSteve Crowe: Thanks Paul. I don't have the information for the change in volumes for same store sales year-to-year. If you give us some time we may be able to get that information for you. Thanks so much.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Gilman of Benchmark, your question please.\nMark Gilman: Steve and Irene, I wonder if we could talk in a little bit greater detail about the West African production numbers. Which in this particular quarter and frankly in some quarters previously, seem to be running below that, which I would expect given the development inventory and progress on projects? Could you alert us to any specific entitlement and production sharing contract effects regarding Angola and Block 14 in particular or ultimately if the first quarter is associated either or would decline from 4Q is associated either with Chad, Nigeria or elsewhere. If you could highlight that as well please?\nIrene Melitas: Yes, Mark thanks for your question. The variance in West Africa is largely driven by Nigeria. Last quarter, we had most of the variance in our Africa production, primarily in liquids, reflected an incremental production that was allocable to us under terms of one of our agreements that were completed in the quarter. These types of allocations occur periodically and are somewhat similar to cost recovery barrels. So what you are seeing 4Q, 1Q is the absence of that allocation, if you will. In Angola, actually the story is quite positive for the quarter. We did show a positive variance and it reflects primarily strong performance of our fields out there, and the addition of one more producing well at BBLT during the first quarter.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks very much, Mark. I think at this juncture, we'll wrap it up. In closing, let me say that we appreciate everybody's participation on today's call. And I especially want to thank each of the analysts on behalf of all the participants for their questions during this morning session. So, Matt back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's first quarter 2007 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day."}], "2009": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2008, "date": "2009-01-30 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning.  Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.  (Operator Instructions).  I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Dave O'Reilly, please go ahead, sir.\nDave O'Reilly: Thank you, operator, and welcome to the Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast.  On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Jim Aleveras, General Manager Investor Relations. Pat took over as CFO from Steve Crowe who retired last month and as extensive experience in all aspects of Chevron's financial operations.  Most recently Pat has been our Vice President and Treasurer and prior to that was Vice President of Government and Public Affairs and before that Vice President of Strategic Planning. You'll have an opportunity to meet her at our meeting in New York on March 10th.  Pat, I'll turn the meeting over to you.\nPatricia Yarrington: Thanks, Dave.  Let's turn now to Chevron's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2008.  We'll refer to the slides that are available on the Web.  Before we get started please remember that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two.  I'll begin with slide three which provides an overview of our financial performance.  The company's fourth quarter earnings were $4.9 billion or $2.44 per diluted share.  Our total fourth quarter 2008 earnings were about the same as fourth quarter 2007. Earnings per share, however, were up about 5% due to our share repurchase program.  Comparing the fourth quarter 2008 to the same period a year earlier, lower crude oil and natural gas prices reduced upstream results while falling prices improved profits in the downstream segment. To recap the balance of slide three, return on capital employed for the year was nearly 27%, under scoring Chevron's financial strength the debt ratio was below 10% at the end of the year and cash balances exceeded debt by $700 million. Share repurchases were $8 billion for the year.  Our latest share repurchase program was authorized by the Board in September 2007 for up to $15 billion over a period of up to three years.  We have now repurchased $10.1 billion of the $15 billion authorized. We do not anticipate repurchasing shares in the first quarter of 2009.  Finally Chevron's 2008 TSR of negative 18% compares favorably to the S&P 500s return of negative 37% and a 37% decline in the MX oil index. Turning to slide four, our total capital spend for 2008 was $22.8 billion compared with our budget of $22.9 billion.  Upstream spending accounted for $17.5 billion of that total.  Our cash C&E which excludes our equity share of affiliate outlays was $20.5 billion. Our announced capital program for 2009 of $22.8 billion is unchanged from 2008 expenditures.  However, about 10% of the total 2009 budget relates to large one-time payments for concessions in the partition neutral zone and Jong Dong Bay (ph) gas field. Excluding these items underlying spending in the upstream segment is budgeted to be lower than last year.  Of the overall 2009 capital program 77% is for upstream activities reflecting the capital intensive phase of some of our long term growth projects.  Another 19% is earmarked for the downstream for a number of investments to upgrade our refining network. Jim will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.  So Jim over to you.\nJames Aleveras: Thanks, Pat.  My remarks compare results of the fourth quarter 2008 with the third quarter 2008.  As a reminder our earnings release compared fourth quarter 2008 with the same quarter a year earlier.  Turning to slide five, fourth quarter net income was about $3 billion lower than the third quarter. Starting with the left side of the chart lower crude oil and natural gas prices caused (inaudible) to decline by more than $3 billion.  Similar to the prior quarter falling commodity prices benefited the downstream segment in the fourth quarter.  The variants in the other bar reflects lower chemical earnings and higher corporate charges. Slide six summarizes the results for our U.S. upstream operations.  Lower crude oil and natural gas prices reduced earnings by $1.6 billion.  Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realization was down about $61 per barrel between quarters similar to the average WTI change of about $59 per barrel between the periods. Production (inaudible) were down 4% mainly due to the full quarter impact of September hurricane shut-ins.  The violent impact reduced fourth quarter earnings by $100 million.  As mentioned in the interim update lower charges related to the hurricanes benefited earnings by about $350 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third. The fourth quarter included a gain of about $600 million from an exchange transaction which included the company's interest in a producing property in Utah.  For comparison asset sales added about $350 million to third quarter profits. This difference of $250 million is shown on the chart.  The other bar is comprised of a number of items.  The largest of which was related to a change in natural gas inventories.  Turning to slide seven, international upstream earnings for the fourth quarter fell nearly $2 billion from the third quarter's results. Lower oil and gas prices reduced earnings by $2.8 billion.  Our average realization per liquids fell about $56 per barrel between sequential quarters compared to the $59 per barrel decline in the average (inaudible) price. Higher liftings benefited fourth quarter earnings by $430 million.  Liftings were higher in Kazakhstan due to the ramp up of the Tengiz expansion and completion of the third quarter facilities turnaround there. The ramp up of Agbami in Nigeria was also a significant factor.  The $210 million favorable variance in tax items shown in the slide reflect various issues in several countries.  Exploration expense was higher between quarters reducing earnings by $140 million.  This is a result of several well write-offs along with higher geological and geophysical expenditures. The other bar is primarily an increase in foreign currency gains.  Slide eight summarizes the quarterly change in the worldwide oil equivalent production including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada. Production increased by 97, 000 barrels per day or 4% between periods.  Though our fourth quarter prices benefited buy-in by 73,000 barrels per day primarily due to production strain contracts and variable royalties. External constraints such as mandated curtailments by opaque member host governments and lower natural gas demand reduced production by 51, 000 barrels per day.  As mentioned earlier the fourth quarter was impacted by the September hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. The volume metric effect was an adverse variance of 27,000 barrels per day.  Base business declines of 17,000 barrels per day were more than offset by the ramp up of production from the Tengiz expansion, Agbami, Blind Faith, and the Northwest Shoal on G-Train 5. Slide nine compares full year 2008 OEG production including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada to that of 2007.  Price impacts on production sharing contracts and variable royalties reduced production by 72,000 barrels per day. WTI prices averaged $72 per barrel in 2007 in contrast to $100 per barrel in 2008.  For the year 2008 external constraints such as mandated curtailments by opaque member host governments and lower natural gas demand reduced production by 13,000 barrels per day. The full year impact of Gulf of Mexico hurricanes was 35,000 barrels per day.  Our base business decline was 78,000 barrels per day, a drop of about 3%.  I'll discuss our outlook for the base business decline in a moment.  Finally our major projects, primarily the Tengiz expansion, Agbami, and the further ramp up of our 2007 Bibyana (ph ) in Banglodesh added 109,000 barrels per day to 2008 production. Blind faith come on extremely late in 2008 and did not have a large impact the full year.  2008 production of 2.5 free million barrels per day came in at 120,000 barrels per day lower than the element we provided at the beginning of the year. The original 2008 outlook of 2.65 million barrels per day assumed crude prices for the year would average $70 per barrel, instead of the $100 average that actually occurred.  Price effects along with external constraints and then September hurricanes noted here were the primary reasons for the difference. Our base business performed solidly better than we assumed, offsetting this we experience a six-month delay in the in the (inaudible).  The rest of our projects started on time but some ramped up more slowly than originally planned. Slide ten shows our production outlook for 2009.  We had previously provided (inaudible) for 2008 that each dollar change in crude prices would inversely change our production by about 2,000 barrels per day due to effect of production sharing and variable (inaudible) agreements. Because of certain thresholds have been reached under these agreements, our rule of thumb for 2009 is each dollar change in crude prices affects production by roughly 1,200 barrels per day.  As before, I caution you that this rule of thumb is very approximate and actually results will differ each of the underlying contracts as different. On this basis comparing 2009 at an assumed price of $50 per barrel, which this is based on last week's future prices, and 2008 at $100 per barrel, the price effects would increase production by 60,000 barrels per day as shown on the chart. External constraints again for (inaudible) member, most Governments and market factors are assumed to reduce production by 80,000 barrels per day.  Base business declines and the impact of lower investment in the base business are expected to reduce production by 188,000 barrels per day. This amount is an implied 7% decline rate in contrast to our previous 4 to 5% base decline guidance due to lower expected oil and gas prices, spending on our base business and mitigating natural fuel declines, will be reduced in 2009. We're still investing to mitigate these declines but at a lower level reflecting the lower level of oil and gas prices.  The big (inaudible) that we do not produce in 2009 will still be there to produce when market conditions are more attractive. Because of the temporarily higher base decline rate and market driven investment deferrals, we do not expect to achieve our full 3% compound annual production growth between 2005 and 2010.  We'll update you further at our annual security analysts meeting in New York on March 10th. Finally, 2009 will benefit from the continued ramp up and full year production in a more recent major capital projects and from the (inaudible) that come on line for later this year including (inaudible) and Brazil, Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico, and Gonzale Luni (ph) in Angola. Turning to slide 11, U.S. downstream operation turned to just over $1 billion essentially flat with the previous quarter.  Indicator margins reduces earnings by $260 million.  Our marketing margins improved lowering refinery margins on the West and Gulf Coast were a large factor. The change in the company's realized margins tracked the change in indicator margins.  WHI prices fell more than $56 per barrel from the end of the third quarter to the end of fourth quarter.  This exceeded the $39 per barrel drop that occurred during the prior quarter. The sharply falling prices caused the downstream to have a large favorable timing effect in both quarters.  Timing effects were $80 million more favorable in the fourth quarter than the third.  On an absolute basis, timing effects in the fourth quarter were about $700 million. The largest factor was provisionally priced or improved which was $370 million in the fourth quarter, about the same it was in the third quarter.  In the previous conference call, I mentioned that the company revised their primary long haul crude supply agreement to the West Coast refineries starting in October. However, August and September liftings were still final (inaudible) in October and November, and prices were about $35 per barrels lower than at the end of the third quarter.  We do not expect a material timing effects for provisionally appraised crude in the first quarter for U.S. operations. The balance of the timing effects was primarily due to inventory, derivative gains associated with shale refined products, a favorable lag in aviation pricing, and other supply related factors.  Finally operating expenses declined largely from lower fuel costs. Turning to slide 12, international downstream earnings improved by $230 million and more than $1 billion.  Defining margins were lower in the fourth quarter.  Our marketing margins were mixed.  Overall our realized margins fell $205 million between the sequential quarters. Volumes were simply lower during the fourth quarter partly reflecting planned maintenance and a (inaudible  00:16:45) refinery in the UK.  The volume effect was an average strand of $30 million.  Timing effects added $525 million to the fourth quarter earnings, compared third quarter earnings. The absolute amount of timing effects in the fourth quarter was roughly $850 million.  Nearly half of the increase between sequential quarters was related to derivative gains and long haul crude new refined products such as PMJ crude, templar exports, and crude sales to equity affiliated refineries. As I mentioned during the last few quarters, we often use derivatives to lock in a margin above the cost of transportation which result in gains when prices decrease and vice versa.  The balance of the timing effects between quarters resulted in gains in derivatives used to convert crude pricing to the time of refinery run. And a favorable lag in aviation pricing as well as other supply related timing factors.  The other burr on this chart reflects an adverse change of $50 million between quarters.  Lower operating expense was more than offset by an adverse swing in point price index. On slide 13 shows that earnings from chemical operations were $28 million the fourth quarter, compared to $70 million in the third quarter.  Results for all (inaudible) due to lower volumes in prices.  (inaudible) range fell primarily because of a one time impairment charge.  The other bar reflects higher additive range. On slide 14 covers all other net charges.  Before the quarter results, net charges of $365 million, comparable to net charges at $190 million in the third quarter.  $310 million of the swing reflects higher corporate charges across a number of areas, $70 million of the change stems from a favorable variance of two tax items. The other bar on slide 14 includes the net of many unrelated items which were $65 million payroll variance between the sequential quarters.  Before turning it over to Dave, I'd just like to briefly recap the fourth quarter. Upstream earnings fell significantly in line with the interim updates.  Downstream continues to benefit from sizable derivative gains due to the declining prices, also noted in the interim update.  And last as projected chemical earnings were lower and all of these charges exceeded the guidance range. Dave O'Reilly will now summarize our 2008 strategic progress and provide some thoughts about 2009.  Dave?\nDave O'Reilly: Well, thank you, Jim.  And turning to slide 15, in 2008, we focused on execution and succeeded across the board.  For several years, we\u2019ve made improvements on our safety performance and were among the best in class. In our upstream business, we committed starting to on three major Chevron operated projects, adding significantly to our long-term production.  The Tengiz expansion like Agbami and Blind Faith are all online and performing well. We also started the first phrase of the North Duri steam flood in Indonesia and achieved first production at five partner operated projects.  We've talked about our exploration success for many years in a row and 2008 was another banner year for exploration, which we'll discuss further at the March Security Analysts Meeting. WE told the investment community that our reserve replacement ratio would improve and on a preliminary basis, we estimate that we replaced 146% of our production in 2008. Now our downstream business we placed to improve refinery reliability.  We delivered on that pledge in 2008 and we had our best fuelization rates on record.  2008 represented a 6.5% improvement in refinery utilization over the base year of 2005. Our downstream portfolio rationalization has continued in 2008 as we exited a number of non-strategic markets.  Finally, we rewarded our shareholders with another double digit increase in our dividends and repurchased $8 billion of our shares. We did so while funding our robust capital program and maintain the balance sheet with more cash than debt at the end of the year.  So we enter these challenging times with the financial strength and flexibility to succeed in the years ahead. Turning to slide 16, let's just look at 2009 briefly.  In our upstream business we're on track to start up three more Chevron operated projects further demonstrating our organic growth potential.  We are also focused on the work needed to continue to advance in our strategically important projects in core areas such as Australia and the deep water Gulf of Mexico. In the downstream business, we're maintaining our focus on refinery utilization to capture the most margin that the market will permit.  And we're continuing to rationalize our portfolio to focus on our strongest markets and those with the most potential for long-term value creation. Across the enterprise we're focused on managing our costs in the same world class process as we used to manage costs when they are rising are now critical to realizing maximum savings on materials and services in a softening market. Combined with capital discipline, our attention to every element of our cost structure will ensure us success during this economic slowdown.  Rewarding our share holders, continuing our disciplined growth, and maintaining our financial strength are all objectives we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue in 2009. Meeting our commitments to our investors, our communities and a world that has long-term need for our products and services has been and will continue to be our priority.  I look forward to discussing the challenges and opportunities of 2009 and the years ahead at our meeting on March 10th in New York City. That concludes our prepared remarks.  We'll now take your questions.  So that everyone has an opportunity to participate, please try to limit your follow up questions to one or two.  So, operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  (Operator instructions).  And our first question comes from Mark Flatery from Credit Swiss.  Your question please.\nMark Flathery -Credit Swiss: Thank you.  My question is on the reserve replacement and I know you have only preliminary numbers and you'll give more details in March but can you give us an early feel for how much the net pricing impact was on these India reserve replacement and whether it was net positive, net negative roughly how big?\nDave O'Reilly: Well Mark, thank you.  We've had a great success with our reserves replacement this year in a number of areas.  Some of the projects that we started up where we had conservatively booked reserves, we were able to rebuy numbers because we now demonstrated through production more confidence in the reservoirs. We've also had some additions from contract extensions such as the PNZ and those will be disclosed in somewhat more detail when we  get to our March meeting. We did benefit, obviously, from price and my recollection is that we're in the 80 \u2013 the organic replacement for one year was above 80% or around 80%.  The balance comes from price.  So we've gained back in price some of what we lost \u2013 a lot of what we lost over the last few years as the numbers went in the other direction, as price went upwards and reduced those reserves. So now that I look over the last ten years it's very gratifying to see that we are at greater than 100% reserve replacement over that long spread of time.  So I feel good about where we are and we'll be covering that in more detail obviously in March. And you'll see a lot more disclosure in the 10-K as well.  So thank you for the question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robert Kessler from Simmons and Company, your questions please.\nRobert Kessler: Good morning and Pat welcome to your new role.  My question relates to your production guidance for 2009.  Looking at the new implied base business decline rate of 7% and comparing that to your recent experience of 3 to 4% I recognize you said there was a gap associated with lower spending. And if I look at your CapEx plan it looks like excluding the one time payments it would have been down about $2.8 billion.  Is that the order of magnitude spending that you estimate would be required to flatten our mitigate that decline rate down to the 4% figure you typically experience? And why given, I would assume you would expect resilence in your portfolio down to $50 a barrel at least, why would you not go ahead and spend that amount in a deflationary oil field service environment?\nDave O'Reilly: Okay a lot of questions there but let me \u2013 generally your observations are on the right track.  But let me give you a reason why I think the primary reason why and maybe even an example of why we think it's unwise to chase after barrels in this environment. We have \u2013 we're clearly pursuing our long term strategic projects that require continued investment over the long term and I cited a number of examples of those.  But let me talk about a very specific example of where we have consciously slowed down and that's in the Peonce (ph). And there are two reasons for it, one is Colorado has instituted some pretty onerous environmental regulations that have made it a lot more difficult to get permits in a timely manner.  So we\u2019ve reduced \u2013 we were planning \u2013 we were in the process of reducing our plans just from an environmental permitting stand point. Also the pricing outlook is looking a little tenuous in that area so we've slowed it down.  In the meantime we expect \u2013 we do expect costs to come down in the good and services and supplies and oil field services area. And as those costs come down we'll obviously have a chance to re-evaluate our portfolio and make decisions to add more investment if we think it's appropriate.  But in this environment we think we're doing the right thing to back off the particularly the opportunities that we can come back to later because they're in this case on fee land. And we're conscious here of the capital discipline that we need to exercise in order to make the right value decision.  So there are a number of those decisions that we've taken. We think they're the right thing to do in this market and we expect as prices --  as costs come down that we'll be \u2013 and permitting requirements are met that we'll be able to reevaluate our position in the future. But I think in current circumstances this is the right thing to do.\nRobert Kessler: Thank you for the color.\nDave O'Reilly: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Mielke from Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nErik Mielke: Yes, good morning.  I'd also like to congratulate Pat on her new role and welcome to the quarterly conference circus.  I'd like to ask a question on the production outlook, as well. Given the experience you've had in 2008 are you being more conservative in your guidance in 2009?  Particularly with respect to the ramp up from the major capital projects out on execution?  And is there anything on the external factors that you can help us understand that number at least a little bit better?  Is that 60,000 barrels per day based on the current run rate or is that project for the contract by opaque?\nDave O'Reilly: Well I think we are taking, I think, a realistic view as best we can of what is happening in the market place with Opaque and some market impacts.  We show an 80,000 barrels per day negative on what we call external factors, and basically that\u2019s roughly what we see. About half of that\u2019s market effects. Half of it is OPEC, but the OPEC impact\u2019s primarily in Venezuela and some in Angola and a little bit in Nigeria. The balance is market effects in gas in Asia. We saw a deterioration in gas demand in Thailand, for example, late in the year. And we just think that it\u2019s not wise for us to count on those markets bouncing back very quickly. They\u2019re still good for the long-term, but in the near-term in \u201909, I think what we\u2019ve done is give you the most realistic assessment that we can of what we call external factors. It\u2019s very hard to predict this with accuracy. But that\u2019s our best shot at it as we see it today.\nErik Mielke: Okay, thanks. Can I ask a follow-up on foreign exchange? There was quite a bit of noise in the quarter from foreign exchange. Are there any handy rules of thumb that you can give us that we can use to try predict some of the overall exposure for group?\nJim Aleveras: Erik, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s a very, very difficult challenge for us. Obviously, different factors come into play depending on the timing on our acquisition of goods and services, depending on the net monetary asset and liability positions in different parts of the company. In general, what we saw overall, the benefit in the fourth quarter was the strengthening dollar. But obviously it hit different segments in different ways. I wish I could provide better guidance in that, but again, because of the mix of components that goes into that, both what we buy, what we sell, as well as the assets and liabilities in our different international businesses, it\u2019s very, very difficult to give anything other than guidance that suggests that strengthening or weakening dollar would help or hurt our clients exchange rates.\nErik Mielke: Okay, and finally, was there any significant over or under-lift in international upstream in the fourth quarter?\nJim Aleveras: In the fourth quarter we had a under-lift relative to our production of about %. For the year as a whole, we were essentially in balance.\nErik Mielke: Thanks very much.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question\u2019s from Michael LaMotte with JPMorgan. Your question please.\nMichael LaMotte: Thank you. Good morning. The question I have is for Dave. The ministry of petroleum in Iraq seems pretty committed to moving forward with MSEs and awards in June of \u201909. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on what that might mean for Chevron this year.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Well, I have just been in the Middle East this month, and there is certainly motivation on their part to move to some agreements, I think, in this year. So there\u2019s been a pick-up in the pace. It\u2019s very hard to predict. Despite the good intentions by the government there to move prospects forward, there are limitations in the capacity of the ministries that just handle the volume of activity. So this could be a year in which some opportunities will get firmed up, but I don\u2019t know how to predict it really. I would hate to go on record and say yes something will happen this year, but we\u2019re clearly interested as many others are. We\u2019re clearly interested as many others are and we\u2019re clearly buying the appropriate packages and ready to move forward and make the appropriate proposals as the opportunities arise.\nMichael LaMotte: Thank you for that. I understand that it is difficult to predict, but just the fact that you are staying close to it is (inaudible).\nDave O\u2019Reilly: We are staying close to it. I can assure you of that.\nMichael LaMotte: Very good, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question\u2019s from Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein. Your question please.\nNeil McMahon: Hi, just a few of them (inaudible) just a question on projects. Could you give us any update on Jack and St. Malo and the current challenging times? I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re doing the sensible thing and renegotiating any potential engineering contracts that you\u2019ve awarded on those projects in terms of feed and rig contracts and also an update on where you are with the Reliance Petroleum option for John Negara (ph)?\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Let me start with the Jack and St. Malo and the lower tertiary in the deep water Gulf of Mexico. This is a very, very important trend and one that we\u2019re really focused on. We had a lot of success in the leasing rounds that just happened this year in the Gulf of Mexico and we have a fine portfolio of prospects in that trend. We are continuing to move forward with Jack and St. Malo and we\u2019re just now at the very early end of the front end engineering works, so this is an ideal time, we think, to be moving into the market as the cost of goods and services are coming down. This is a great opportunity for us and we\u2019ll certainly talk more about it in-depth at the March analyst meeting, but let me assure you, this is one of our top priorities for the long-term and one that\u2019s getting a lot of our attention and we think it\u2019s a good time for us to be starting to move into the market on these opportunities. On Reliance, we are discussing with Reliance the opportunity there at the John Negara Refinery. These are sensitive commercial discussion and I\u2019d prefer not to comment on the at the present time. But this is a year which the situation there will clearly become clarified as we\u2019ve been predicting for some time.\nNeil McMahon: Just a quick follow-up on Jack and St. Malo, too, given the fact that you\u2019re entering this, it seems, in a very logical, sensible manner, are we to presume then middle of the decade before we see any significant production coming on from any of those lower tertiary developments?\nNeil McMahon: Well, it will be in the next decade since we\u2019re almost there. I would hope that we would have production before the middle of the decade at this point. This year, though, will be clearly one with a lot of engineering work and I think we\u2019ve come very close to selecting the optimum conceptual development plan. So I would hope that by the middle of the decade we would have good production there, but I think we\u2019ll try to predict that a little better for you in March when we see you all.\nNeil McMahon: Thanks. Operator Your next question is from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nArjun Murti: Thank you. Perhaps it\u2019s a little bit of a follow-up on the question on the base declines and the decision to spend less there, and I appreciate part of it\u2019s the environmental regs, but also service costs are still high and oil prices have come down. You still have, otherwise, a very robust capital program and it seems like costs have been inflated in industry across the board. Perhaps some of those major development projects you can\u2019t stop at this point because you\u2019re already in the middle of them, but if there\u2019s perhaps cost concerns in going through with the base business, wouldn\u2019t that also be true of the growth projects that you\u2019re not really slowing those down? I\u2019m just trying to reconcile those two things.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Well, thank Arjun, let me comment on that. We sanctioned very few projects in 2007 and 2008. Many of the projects that came on stream in 2008 and are coming on in 2009 were sanctioned and most of the expenditures and commitments to spend were made in the 2003, 4, 5 period. So while yes, there has clearly been some cost escalation, none of these projects were launched and made major commitments to at the peak of cost. So we are in fact, I think, in a very good position because the next projects that we sanctioned in our queue will be going out for repress for proposal in \u201909 and in 2010. And this, we think is a good window for that because costs are clearly softening. There\u2019s a little bit of a lag, but on the other hand we\u2019ve seen costs come down quite a bit faster than they have in the past, which tells you that we could be hitting a sweet spot here for some of these projects. It\u2019s hard to predict, but clearly that\u2019s going to be part of our thinking, and we believe that these major projects that are good for our long-term will be cost-competitive in this environment. Now, obviously if we are wrong about that, we have the flexibility to go back to investing more into the base business if those costs justify. But we think we\u2019re making the right, balanced decision here. And given the slack in the market, I think it's good timing.\nArjun Murti: Dave, that\u2019s actually really helpful comment and I really appreciate that. Are you confident that you\u2019ll be able to sanction these and that the negations and in this very uncertain environment can get done to then be able to sanction them and move forward or is the \u201909 budget perhaps a higher than likely level of spending and as you get through these negotiations and sanction the products, it\u2019s more the \u201910 and \u201911 CapEx that will be more robust? If it is still a very high level of CapEx, I don\u2019t have an issue with it. I hear you, but we are still spending a decent amount in \u201909.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Well, yes, look, clearly if we can\u2019t justify and don\u2019t feel comfortable with the costs relative to the outlook for the business, we would wait; I think is the best way of putting it. We have some flexibility on some of these major projects, but I think the reality that we see in the market place right now is we think this is a good time to be going back in the market. So if we\u2019re wrong, well then obviously these numbers are too high and we\u2019ll back off. But I think we\u2019re seeing signs that this market is changing more rapidly than it has in the past. I think the suppliers of goods and services to our industry realize that they\u2019re in a different environment as well. The ones that are in it for the long-term clearly want our business and they\u2019ll be modifying their pricing appropriately, so I think some of that\u2019s going to occur.\nArjun Murti: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: You\u2019re welcome Arjun.\nOperator: Your next question is from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital. Your question please. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital Thank you. Good morning, guys. When you\u2019re talking about the cost reduction that you\u2019re expecting, how has is that so far with your negotiation with your wind men ? Are they receptive and recognize that that change is coming down? And how quickly do you think that the lower cost may start to flow through and to benefit you guys and from that aspect when you\u2019re talking about lower treasury, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about the (inaudible) George was thinking about extending it potentially in the second half of 2009 and if the market conditions may have changed that expectation at this point.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: I think I\u2019ve commented on the lower tertiary already, but let me just talk about Australia and Gorgon for a moment. We are on track to sanctioning that project late in the year. Again, we think this is good timing. We are currently in the market with our FPs. The Australian dollar has weakened significantly. There\u2019s a lot of capacity now in the labor force in Australia as many of the resource industries have deferred activity in mining and other activities. So there\u2019s a lot of interest in this project and I think this is a good time for us to be out in the market beginning to assess and call for prices for equipment and for services and construction. So how it will turn out will remain to be seen, but we\u2019re bullish on Gorgon and believe that\u2019s one that we hope we\u2019ll be able to tie up and create something long-term for the company sometime late in the year. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital Can I have a follow-up Dave? In the last three years, rightfully, after your Unicom acquisition, the company has been focusing on organic projects and not really looked that much on the M&A markets. I\u2019m wondering if the wheel had changed now the market condition had changed (inaudible) and sometimes people will say that you want to be a cognizant buyer. Nothing specific, I just wanted to see what is the management\u2019s view about that subject?\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Well, two answers to that question. First of all, we clearly have a great organic queue of projects here that we\u2019re continuing to pursue and invest in and we believe that, certainly compared to our size, we are among the best in the industry in that area. And then we\u2019re fueling that in the background with continued success in our explorations program. Look we\u2019re not blind to what\u2019s going on in the world around us, and we make assessments of the opportunities. But those are hard to predict and I prefer not to comment on them, but clearly we\u2019re not blind to looking for other opportunities as well. But our priority in 2009, I think, is going to be on advancing these projects and bringing them to market as well as starting up the ones that are in the commissioning phase that Jim referred to in his remarks a few minutes ago. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital Thank you.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jason Gammel from Macquarie. Your question please.\nJason Gammel: Thank you. I\u2019d like to add my congratulations to Pat on your new role. Dave, you\u2019ve had a lot of specific questions today relative to some of the projects you have captured, and I think you just marked your ninth anniversary as CEO, so let me just ask a little broader question. How would you assess the state of your investment opportunities now relative to where it\u2019s been over the course of your tenure? Dave O\u2019 Reilly Well, thanks Jason. I think the depth and quality of our queue of opportunities is stronger than any time it\u2019s been in that nine years. And I say that not just based on the projects we\u2019ve been talking about very specifically and that we\u2019ve had a number of questions on this morning, but also the success we\u2019re continuing to have with our exploration program that tells me that that\u2019s going to lead to future developments in the next decade that will be value creating for the company for the long-term. So I see us in a very, very strong position and I feel very good about the opportunities that we have in the years ahead.\nJason Gammel: That\u2019s appreciated. Maybe as a follow-up I could ask another open-ended one. What do you see as the two or three biggest challenges facing the company over the next two to three years? Dave O\u2019Reilly Well, clearly managing through this uncertain period, which is something we\u2019ve done before a number of times as a company and as an industry. We are clearly in a more challenging environment with lower demand. I think we have to go back to the early 80s to see two years of back-to-back oil demand decline. So we had a modest decline globally last year. It\u2019s projected that there\u2019ll be another one this year. So managing out costs and staying focused on the long-term is clearly our objective here. And clearly we\u2019re in a good position to do it because of our strong balance sheet and because we delivered during the good times so that we have that flexibility during the tougher times. The second item I think is the whole issue of carbon management over the next five years or so as the world tries to struggle with how to value carbon and how that affects the business. So I see those as two challenges over the next couple of years, one we\u2019ve been through before a number of times and we\u2019re used to it\u2014the cyclical activity. But I think we\u2019re moving into an area where we\u2019ll be dealing with this new issue. And I don\u2019t mean new in the European sense where we\u2019re already managing it quite well, but I mean in a global sense as more and more countries sign up for carbon management and the impacts on business will clearly be there. And the people who manage successfully will do better than those that don\u2019t.\nJason Gammel: I appreciate that context. Thanks Dave.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: You\u2019re welcome. Thank you, Jason. Operator Your next question is from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nPaul Sankey: Hello everyone. I would just like to carry on a little bit on the CapEx question if I could, sort of related to what Arjun was asking. I understood that you had quite a significant ForEx benefit from a stronger dollar, perhaps as much as a 10 to 20% implied benefit given that a lot of your spending obviously is abroad, which again would have led me to think your CapEx number would come down. You\u2019ve also, as we\u2019ve covered, said you stepped back in the US spending. Could you just help me rationalize that particular part of the balance? Thanks.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: I don\u2019t think we saw a significant benefit CapEx on the strengthening dollar in \u201908. A lot of that dollar strengthening occurred very, very late in the year. And so basically the \u201908 numbers certainly reflect an average year. As Jim said, it\u2019s very hard to predict this. We\u2019re in uncharted waters. The dollar has been a safe haven at the moment and some other currencies have declined, but clearly some of these numbers could change if there were more dramatic changes in relative valuations of currencies, but I just don\u2019t think I feel comfortable about trying to predict that 2009. But I do feel comfortable telling you that 2008 did not see significant benefit.\nPaul Sankey: David, I was really thinking about 2009 relative to 2008 and all things equal with the move that we had in foreign currencies, we would have thought your CapEx would step down, especially when you then add on a somewhat lower level of spending in the US.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Well, there\u2019s perhaps a little bit of a step down in a few areas, but remember that when you look at the budget here, about 10% of that budget is for one time payments for concession extension. So the budget has come down by about 10%. And part of that is built into that 10%, our current assessment of that. But it\u2019s a prediction and nobody really, truly knows how the relative exchange rates are going to turn out. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s game to try to over guess it.\nPaul Sankey: Great, thanks. And then just briefly on the buy back, I believe you said that you would not be buying back shares in Q1. Could you talk a little bit about that decision relative to obviously what we\u2019ve said about CapEx and what we\u2019ve said perhaps about M&A as well? Thanks.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: I\u2019m going to turn it over to Pat to talk about our financial priorities. She\u2019s been sitting here patiently and you\u2019ve all been congratulating her, but she needs to chime in here on this subject as the keeper of the balance sheet. So pat?\nPat Yarrington: Okay, well thanks Dave. I was feeling like I was turning into a potted plant here for a moment. But thanks for the question. Our financial priorities really are from a cash standpoint sustaining and growing the dividend, then funding the capital program that we have where we\u2019ve got projects that bring good returns over a viable vast range of commodity prices, and then maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. So we\u2019ve always seen the share repurchase program as sort of the discretionary part of that. And we\u2019re just indicating certainly for the first quarter of 2009 that we\u2019re not going to have a continuation of that repurchase program.\nPaul Sankey: I guess you\u2019d expect debt to rise even so in Q1.\nPat Yarrington: I think that that\u2019s a reasonable expectation. As Dave said, we de-levered when the times were right giving us that flexibility now. When revenue stream has come down and our cost structure obviously is adjusting but perhaps not quite as rapidly, so I think you could expect to see a modest increase in the debt balance in the first quarter. We\u2019re very well positioned though to, even at low, sustained prices, have a very strong balance sheet.\nPaul Sankey: Okay, Pat I didn\u2019t congratulate you, so I will. Congratulations.\nPat Yarrington: Well, thank you.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Thanks for the questions Paul.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Mathis from Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Hello Mike?\nMike Mathis: I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s been answered. Thank you.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Okay, you\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Gilman from Benchmark. Your question please.\nMark Gilman: Folks, good morning. I have a couple of things if I could please. Was there any change in the fiscal terms that was agreed upon associated with the extension of the concession of the MZ, Dave? .\nDave O\u2019Reilly: No, the fundamental terms are the same Mark. Okay, and the production outlook for 2009 and the price effect therein, are there any thresholds that are included in that under the $50 a barrel assumption?\nDave O\u2019 Reilly: Well, the $50 a barrel we picked from the stripped price. We did hit some thresholds when the prices were high back in\u2014you\u2019re talking about production sharing thresholds?\nMark Gilman: Yes, cumulative capital costs recovery or rate of return or cumulative production, any of the things that went into Jim\u2019s comments regarding the change in the sensitivity.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Yes, Jim, why don\u2019t you deal with that one for me?\nJim Aleveras: Mark, the changes that we saw in 2008\u2014and we did hit some thresholds in 2008\u2014were why we had a higher volume impact per dollar per barrel of change in price in crude. Looking ahead to 2009, since we\u2019ve already crossed those thresholds, we feel lower volume impact per dollar change in crude prices.\nMark Gilman: Yes, Jim, but what I\u2019m asking is, are any threshold impacts built into the 60,000 a day price effect as part of your 2009 forecast?\nJim Aleveras: Not many, most of them are behind us, which is why the number has come down.\nMark Gilman: Okay, Dave can I infer from Jack St. Malo comments that the appraisal wells had been or have been drilling were successful?\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Well, I think we\u2019re going to report on the appraisal in March, but I think you can infer that we\u2019re on the right track and we\u2019ll give you a lot more detail in March.\nMark Gilman: Okay, just one final clarification Dave, regarding the 80% organic reserve replacement in \u201908, does that include the reserves associated with the concession extension at the NZ? Dave O\u2019Reilly Yes. And you\u2019ll see more detail in the K.\nMark Gilman: Thank you.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Mielke from Merrill Lynch. Your question.\nErik Mielke: I\u2019m sorry fellows for another question, I just thought I\u2019d ask for an update on (inaudible) and you\u2019ve been running through the other key projects. In your CapEx statement, you said you had an initial payment but the bonus payment also has some initial development. If you could, give us some guidance on where you expect to take that in 2009.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Well, yes, thanks Erik. We are progressing with the construction work in (inaudible). So it\u2019s actively moving forward and the appropriate capital is included in our program. You view that as another long-term project that will benefit the company for many decades to come. So yes, that one is on track compared to what we told you last year. And again, we\u2019ll be updating you in the March meeting, but thank you for the question.\nErik Mielke: Was it part of your reserve bookings for \u201908?\nDave O\u2019Reilly: You\u2019ll see the details in the K. I can\u2019t answer that right now.\nErik Mielke: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question is from Mark Gilman from Benchmark. Your question please.\nMark Gilman: Guys, the exploration/spend component, the 2009 capital budget versus 2008, give me an idea of what it is.\nJim Aleveras: It\u2019s about flat between 2009 and 2008.\nMark Gilman: Level, Jim?\nJim Aleveras: Pretty much so, yes Mark.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: A little bit more appraisal in balance between appraisals versus pure exploration, but we\u2019re going to go through a very detailed review of our exploration program and our plans for \u201909 very specifically in the analyst meeting.\nMark Gilman: Okay, thanks folks.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: You\u2019re very welcome. I think it\u2019s time to wind it up Matt unless there are other questions.\nOperator: At this time I show no further questions.\nDave O\u2019Reilly: Well, thank you very much for listening. We appreciate everyone\u2019s participation in the call. I want to thank you for your questions this morning and look forward to seeing many of you in March in New York. So, Matt, thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. (Operator Instructions) Good day."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-10-31 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good Morning. My name is Matt and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter 2008 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Steve Crowe. Please go ahead, sir.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks, Matt. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earning conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are George Kirkland, Executive Vice President, Global Upstream & Gas; and Jim Aleveras, General Manager, Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron\u2019s financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2008. We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on the web. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I\u2019ll begin with Slide 3, which provides an overview of our financial performance. The company\u2019s third quarter earnings were a record $7.9 billion, or $3.85 per diluted share. Our third quarter 2008 results were more than double our third quarter 2007 earnings. Higher crude oil and natural gas prices contributed to our upstream performance. Our downstream operations benefited from improved margins, strong refinement utilization, and from timing effects related to the substantial drop in the price of oil during the third quarter. Third quarter 2008 earnings rose over 30% compared with the second quarter 2008, which Jim will discuss shortly. To recap the balance of slide 3: Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 27%. Capital and exploratory spending was $5.5 billion for quarter. Stock buybacks were $2 billion during the period. Underscoring Chevron\u2019s financial strength the debt ratio was below 8% at the end of the quarter and cash balances exceeded debt by $4 billion. Jim will now take us through the quarterly comparisons. Jim?\nJim Aleveras: Thanks, Steve. My remarks compare the results of the third quarter 2008 with the second quarter 2008. As a reminder, our earnings release compared third quarter 2008 with the same quarter a year ago. Turning to slide 4, third quarter net income was $1.9 billion higher than the second quarter. Starting with the left side of the chart, lower crude oil and natural gas realizations and lower volumes reduced worldwide upstream results by more than $1 billion. At the same time, the significant decrease in crude oil prices during the quarter benefited the downstream segments, which improved nearly $2.6 billion in the second quarter\u2019s loss position. The variance in the residual other bar largely reflects the absence of charges at the corporate level that were taken in the prior quarter. Slide 5 summarizes the results of our U.S. upstream operations, which were essentially unchanged between quarters. Lower crude oil and natural gas realizations reduced earnings by $130 million. Chevron\u2019s average U.S. crude oil realization was down $1.75 per barrel between consecutive quarters. This was less than the roughly $5.50 per barrel decline in WTI spot prices between quarters since much of our Gulf of Mexico crude oil production is priced on a lagged basis. Production volumes were down 8% between quarters, primarily due to hurricane related shut-ins during September, these reduced earnings by $195 million. Additionally, as we mentioned in the interim update, expenses related to the hurricanes reduced earnings by roughly $400 million. These included incremental cost to abandon toppled platforms, asset write-offs and initial repairs. George will discuss our hurricane recovery efforts in more detail in a few minutes. Asset sales added about $350 million to third quarter profits. These included a non-operated interest and a K2 property along with other smaller property sales. The other bar on this chart is the net of everything else. The largest single item was higher earnings in our natural gas marketing division including gains and derivatives related to gas contracts. The magnitude of these gains was directly related to the drop in natural gas prices during the quarter. Turning to slide 6, international up stream earnings for the third quarter fell about $1.1 billion from the second quarter's results. Lower oil and natural gas prices reduced earnings by $250 million. Our average unit realizations for liquids fell about $7.70 per barrel between sequential quarters. Roughly, $1.50 per barrel more than the average brand spot price decline. Lower liftings had a $635 million adverse impact on the third quarter earrings. The largest reduction was in Kazakhstan reflecting lower production, which I'll cover in the next slide. Liftings were also lower in Azerbaijan, Angola, Congo, and China. Overall, third quarter liftings were about 2% less than production, while we were slightly over lifted in the second quarter. Through the nine months liftings in production were roughly in balance. More than half of the adverse change in the DD&A and OpEx bar on the chart reflected impairments of several matured fields in the North Sea. Operating expense was higher due to labor and transportation costs and start up costs of our Agbami project. The bar is the net of the foreign exchange effects partly offset by the absence of favorable prior quarter tax items and numerous unrelated matters. Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in worldwide oil equivalent production, including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada. Production fell by 94,000 barrels per day or nearly 4% between periods. U.S. production declined 55,000 barrels per day chiefly as a result of shut-ins during September for hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Outside the US, overall production dropped 39,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. In Kazakhstan most of the 55,000 barrel per day reduction reflected completion of TCO's second generation plant and concurrent annual facility maintenance. These had a larger impact than we had expected at the time of last quarter's call. Lower production at Karachaganak was also a factor. The increase in Nigerian volumes was due to the start up of our Agbami project in late July. George will provide the outlook for production in the fourth quarter and full year 2008 shortly. Turning to slide 8, U.S. downstream operations moved from a $680 million loss in the second quarter to a $1 billion profit in the third quarter. Industry margins reduced earnings by $180 million. Chevron\u2019s actual margin capture and higher volumes in the third quarter increased earnings by $100 million and partly offset the decline in industry indicator margins. Due to significantly less planned refinery downtime in the third quarter, earnings improved by $380 million. Chevron\u2019s U.S. refineries operated with minimal downtime. Given the extraordinary volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, and their impact on our downstream earnings, we've highlighted timing effects during the last few quarterly calls. [West Texas] immediate prices fell more than $39 per barrel from the end of the second quarter to the end of the third quarter. This compares to an increase of over $38 per barrel during the previous quarter. The unprecedented swing in prices during each period resulted in an earnings changes of $1.3 billion between sequential quarters. Of this $1.3 billion favorable variance shown in the bar about $700 million reflected the impact of provisionally priced foreign crudes, which lowered second quarter earnings on an absolute basis by $340 million, and increased third quarter earnings by $360 million. About $200 million of the $1.3 billion total was the swing from losses to gains in mark-to-market derivatives related to a long-term fixed price crude purchase contract. Over $120 million of the $1.3 billion reflected the absence of second quarter derivative losses related to converting crudes from the acquisition price to the price at the time we were on. We discontinued most of our derivative use for crude price conversion in the U.S. in early June. The balance of the timing effects primarily resulted from a favorable change in derivative impacts related to the sales of refine products and from gains due to the timing of aviation fuel pricing and all other supply related timing effects. We have revised our primary long haul crude supply agreement for our West Coast refineries. Beginning with October liftings all barrels will be priced at the average price during the month of lifting rather than at the time of discharge. This change will eliminate provisional pricing on these crudes and we expected to significantly reduce the timing effects in our U.S. downstream earnings. However, fourth quarter earnings will include the impacts of final pricing adjustments for October and November deliveries that were lifted during the third quarter. Returning to the chart, the other bar is largely due to better lubricant margins and the absence of pipeline impairments, I mentioned last quarter. Turning to slide 9, international downstream earnings improved to $817 million in the second quarter's loss. Margins were a minor favorable item, as improved marketing margins overcame weaker refining margins. Volumes benefited slightly following completion of repairs at our Pembroke Refinery in the U.K. As in the U.S., international downstream timing effects were major factor in the favorable change between quarters, as the price of crude and petroleum products fell significantly. Of the $860 million favorable timing effects shown in the bar, more than half was related to derivative gains on sales of long-haul equity crude and refined products, such as, partitioned neutral zone crude and Pembroke product exports. As I mentioned last quarter, we often use derivatives to lock in a margin above the cost of transportation, which can result in gains when prices decrease and vice versa. More than $100 million of the 860 million total shown in the bar reflected gains in the third quarter as compared to losses in the second quarter and derivatives used to convert crude pricing to the time of refinery run. The balance of the timing effects is primarily due to favorable inventory impacts, gains due to the timing of aviation fuel pricing, and all other supply-related timing effects. Going forward, we're taking actions as appropriate, to reduce the volatility of this segment, the price fluctuations. The other bar on the slide shows a $51 million adverse variance between quarters. This is the net of foreign exchange gains, offset by operating cost and tax items. Slide 10 shows that earnings from chemical operations were $70 million in the third quarter compared to $41 million in the second quarter. Results for olefins improved on higher margins along with lower operating expense. Aromatics results fell somewhat, due to startup costs, for the Jubail Chevron Phillips Styrene operation. The other bar reflects lower additive earnings. Slide 11 covers all other. Third quarter results were net charges of $190 million compared to net charges of $580 million in the second quarter. $190 million of the swing reflects lower environmental charges, and $110 million stems from a favorable variance in tax items. The other bar on slide 11 includes the net of many unrelated items which were favorable variants between sequential quarters. In total, the third quarter net charge was less than our standard guidance of $250 million to $300 million. For the various reasons stated in the interim update. Before turning it over to George, I'd just like to briefly recap the third quarter. Upstream earnings and volumes were down somewhat inline with the interim update. We experienced a strong improvement in downstream performance, due to timing effects rising from sharper declining crude and product prices and less refinery downtime also as outlined in the interim update. Fine line, as projected chemical results benefited from higher margins. George Kirkland is now going to provide an update on our production outlook for 2008, our hurricane recovery plans, and our upstream projects status through 2009. George?\nGeorge Kirkland: Thanks, Jim. Before I update you on the major capital projects, I'd like to review our production. Please turn to slide 13. This graph compares net OEG production through the first nine months of 2008; first is the first nine months of last year. Total OEG production through the third quarter was 2.53 million barrels per day. Although production is down 95,000 barrels per day about 80,000 barrels per day of this loss is attributable to price effects on the net entitlement barrels and 17,000 barrels a day is attributable to the disruptions from hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico. I\u2019ll discuss the hurricane impacts in just a few moments. Despite these losses, we have been very successful in managing our base business declines and capturing gains for major capital projects that have recently come online. The low base business decline is a positive indicator of our base business efforts, where we have experienced improved reliability across the enterprise. Adjusting for favorable gas market conditions in the Asia-Pacific region, and the Indonesian unitization settlement, our base business decline rate is approaching the low end of our 4% to 5% decline guidance. Now, I'll update you on the production outlook for the remainder of the year. Please turn to slide 14. Assuming fourth quarter prices will average approximately $70 a barrel, and thereby, approximately $100 a barrel for the whole year. Our 2008 production outlook is estimated at 2.55 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. This graph compares the 2008 outlook to year-to-date third quarter actuals, and our fourth quarter production outlook. The last bar on the right shows the 2008 guidance provided last January. Absent the yearly price effects of about 60,000 barrels per day and hurricane disruptions, which we estimate to be about 35,000 barrels per day, the full year net production would be in line with the prior guidance. The fourth quarter production forecast is estimated at 2.62 million barrels per day, significantly higher than year-to-date actuals. This is driven by two factors; the continued ramp up of our major capital projects, principally, Agbami and the Tengiz expansion and lower prices. Project ramp ups are estimated to add approximately 170,000 barrels per day during the quarter. The impact of lower prices on net entitlement barrels, associated with production sharing contracts will likely increase production by about 45,000 barrels per day during the quarter. Offsetting these gains are hurricane disruptions, which are estimated at 65,000 barrels per day for the quarter and the continued base business declines which includes ongoing operational difficulties in Azerbaijan. I would like to now spend a few moments to provide additional details on the hurricanes. Please turn to slide 15. This slide shows the trajectory of hurricanes Gustav and Ike with respect to Chevron leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The leases are shown in yellow. The wind field for hurricane Gustav is shown in red and for hurricane Ike in green. We are pleased to report that there were zero safety incidence associated with the evacuation of personnel from our offshore facilities. 3500 personnel were safely evacuated for Gustav and 1500 for Ike. We did sustain damage from the storms. Overall, there were 13 toppled structures, four leaning structures and three missing well heads. The long term impact of this damage on production is not great. It is estimated that between 6,000 to 10,000 barrels a day will be permanently lost. In the deepwater areas there were some minor damages sustained at Petronius and Genesis where production is now being restored. There was no damage to the Blind Faith facility and only minor damage to Tahiti. I'd now like to share an update on the current restoration effort and forecast, if you would please turn to slide 16. This chart shows the anticipated net OEG production restoration profile by month. The actual restored production to date is shown on the solid blue line and the outlook is in the dash line. Pre-Gustav production from the Gulf of Mexico averaged about 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As of this week, total restored production is 55% of pre-storm levels. Of the remaining production to be restored, about three quarters is dependent on the timing of third party pipeline repairs. Let me assure you that we have a dedicated team of professionals actively working with our partners and stakeholders to keep our restoration efforts on track. I'd like now to provide an update on our major capital projects. Please turn to slide 17. Chevron has reached some critical major capital project milestones in 2008. So far this year six projects have started up. It is also anticipated that another two will start up in the fourth quarter, North Duri Area 12 in Indonesia and Blind Faith in the Gulf of Mexico. On July 29, our Nigerian affiliate commenced crude oil production from the Agbami field, this is a significant accomplishment. Agbami initial gross oil equivalent production has ramped up to more than 110,000 barrels per day. We anticipate the ramp up to continue reaching 250,000 barrels per day by the end of 2009. Well, September 22, our Tengizchevroil affiliate completed a major expansion at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan that has nearly doubled production capacity to 540,000 barrels per day. Remember that the first phase of this expansion started up during the fourth quarter of 2007. All phases are now complete and commissioned. In Western Australia on the September 1, the fifth Train at the North West Shelf\u2019s Venture liquefied natural gas facility became operational. This production facility is expected to increase the joint venture\u2019s export capacity by about four million metric tons of LNG annually to 16.3 million metric tons. During the second quarter, in conjunction with our joint venture partners, first oil was achieved from the Moho-Bilondo field in the Republic of Congo. Please turn to slide 18. Other projects that have achieved first production during the first three quarters of 2008 are ACG Phase III in Azerbaijan and Brodgar-Callanish in United Kingdom. I\u2019ll now touch on the remaining project startups for 2008. In the Gulf of Mexico, the last stages of commissioning are taking place at the Blind Faith facility, and first oil is anticipated in November. There was no damage to the facility during Hurricane Ike, but it did disrupt commissioning activities. In Indonesia, the next phase development at the heavy oil Duri field remains on schedule; it is also expected to start up in November. Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 19. Looking forward to 2009, I\u2019d like to provide you with a status on the major capital project milestones that are anticipated next year. Let\u2019s start in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater with our Tahiti project. The project is progressing on schedule. The spar hole was installed during the first quarter and the topside modules during the third quarter of this year. The facility sustained minor damage during hurricane Ike and will be repaired during ongoing hookup and commissioning activities. However, this will not delay the projects and we still anticipate first oil by the third quarter of 2009. In Brazil, at the Frade field construction of the FPSO is 85% complete with a sail-away from Dubai expected in late December. First oil is expected during the second quarter of 2009. In Angola, the Tombua Landana project remains on schedule, to meet first oil during the second half of 2009. The hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, did not significantly impact the schedule for sail-away of the various compliant pile tower components. The Large Scale Steam Pilot in the Partitioned Neutral Zone also remains on schedule. If this pilot is successful, it will lead to a full-field development at Wafra. First steam injection is expected during early 2009. Finally, I would like to provide a summary of other key 2008 upstream highlights. Please turn to slide 20. For September 10, we announced the extension and amendment of the Partitioned Neutral Zone operating agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This agreement extends the existing arrangement for 30 years through 2039. In Canada, at the Hebron field, formal binding agreements were signed in August between Hebron project proponents and the government of Newfoundland and Labrador. These agreements paved the way for the project to proceed. During the third quarter, Chevron transferred operatorship to ExxonMobil following ratification by co-venture partners. In Australia, our LNG projects are progressing toward key milestones. At Gorgon, the joint venture is pursuing a project scope of 3-5 million metric tons per annum LNG trains. A final investment decision is expected after environmental approvals have been provided by the State and Commonwealth for the third train proposal and following the completion of engineering and design. Wheatstone, which represents a tremendous growth opportunity for Chevron Australia is progressing towards FEED. It builds on our extensive natural gas resources in Western Australia and is expected to make our company a leading natural gas supplier and operator of LNG facilities in the Asia-Pacific region. We announced our attention during the first quarter to develop Wheatstone as a grain field onshore LNG and domestic gas project. And finally at Chuandongbei, we expect the initial FID by the end of this year. The appropriate engineering and design work required to sanction the project work. The project is on track. We assumed operational control of the existing operations in August. This concludes the project update and now I will turn it back over to Steve.\nSteve J. Crowe: Thank you, George. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take your questions; one question and one follow-up per caller, please. Matt, open the lines for questions. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Mark Flannery from Credit Suisse. Your question please?\nMark Flannery: Thanks. Yes, just a question for George, while coming into budgeting season, things are looking very different on the commodity side. Nobody really knows what\u2019s going to happen in 2009 of course, but given what\u2019s happened to oil prices. Could you tell me what you\u2019re thinking about when you think about the \u201909 CapEx budgets for the upstream, particularly with regards to the more capital intensive end of the spectrum? I\u2019m not looking for a number, because I know we won\u2019t get one, but just what\u2019s your thought process around that right now?\nGeorge Kirkland: Let\u2019s just first start off that we haven\u2019t finished our budgeting process we\u2019re going through the approval process, we\u2019ve been working through that. Our thought processes on any project that has already moved into construction of past FID, those projects will move very much through their cycle would never slow those down. And we anticipate trying to hold our capital spending pretty much in line of where we\u2019ve been this year. We don\u2019t like fluctuating our capital spend up and down. Our long-term view on pricing has not changed. So I would look at this point at capital spending very similar between years and recognize if we have something different, we want to change. We have flexibility on near-term projects not our long-term projects. We really can\u2019t back-off for long-term projects.\nSteve Crowe: Mark, let me just expand a little bit on just the mechanics that George alluded to. We're right in the middle now of finalizing our business plans and the capital spending for 2009, and per our normal practice it would be our intention to have a release and provide the 2009 capital program sometime around the middle of December. So, about six weeks from now, I think, would be the approximate time you'll hear our final program for next year. Do you have a follow-up question?\nMark Flannery: I do and it's on the same topic. I wondered, George, could you characterize the capital expenditure program that you have or you are putting together for 2009. How much of that would you describe as fully discretionary i.e. not part of projects that have gone through FID, not part of projects about to meet FID, that kind of thing. What's the wiggle room would you think in the budget?\nGeorge Kirkland: Just an estimate without numbers in front of me and recognizing that probably 75%, 80% of our project expenditures are related to projects that are post FID, so, those are pretty far along at this point. So there is not a lot of wiggle room in the first year. Our wiggle room in capital spending is much greater in the second year of our budget cycle, and of course, very large amount in our third year of our budget cycle.\nMark Flannery: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks, Mark. May we have the next questioner please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays Capital. Your question please?\nPaul Cheng: Hi, gentlemen.\nGeorge Kirkland: Hi.\nSteve Crowe: Hi, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: My question is related to the CapEx. I know you are not going to talk on numbers, so I am not asking that. But, George when you are looking at with potentiality, oil surfaces cost and the raw material cost [next year] everything are coming down. Is that a trade-off, there is certain project, if you delay it even if they are already FID delayed, you may be able to get a much lower cost structure. So, want to see that, I mean, how you view on that?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, there is no doubt for projects that have not reached FID where you don't have contracts with and what we are expecting is we are expecting that the cost of goods and services are going to come down. So, we would I think look very strongly at slight movements on projects that made sense. From the cost of building them, if it's going to come down we would look at sliding those a little bit. I actually see this as a real opportunity for companies like Chevron. I do expect the cost of goods and services to come down. I think the financing is going to hurt others to move projects forward. So my expectation is shipyards and equipment manufacturers, there'll be less pressure on them than there has been. So, I think, there is going to some benefit for some of our future big projects with cost reductions.\nSteve Crowe: Paul, do you have a follow up question?\nPaul Cheng: Yes, if I could. Yes, actually, somewhat unrelated Tengizchevroil now you said 540,000 barrel per a day. I think there is a long time objective, when they get to a 700,000 barrel per day plus. I want to see if George has any update on where we are in that process?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well let me deal with the expansion. Our expansion, the name plate on it was 540. We've reached that and we don't yet know if we can get a few more barrels out of it, but my expectation is we are probably going to be able to get a few more barrels, and maybe by our March meeting with the analysts that we'll have a little more word on that to see if we\u2019ve been able to increase the capacity further. I believe, I mentioned that our Analyst Meeting earlier in March this year that we were looking at the next expansion for Tengiz. We\u2019d like to move that engineering work forward as fast as we can. We\u2019ve learned an awful lot about what we can do on big, big projects in the Kazakhstan area of where we operate Tengiz. So, it's a good time to be ready to move forward with the next expansion, and I know a little more information about the performance, of course, on the gas injection as the year plays on out. So, I think, all of those things line up for us to want to move the next expansion forward, of course, we have to get all of our partners on board with that.\nPaul Cheng: George, can I put in a quick question in here? For 10-Q with the [SEC], you guys will be able to put more reserve this year?\nGeorge Kirkland: I think it's a little premature to talk about reserves; we\u2019re just in the process of going through our reserve reviews around the world, and I\u2019d really rather wait to talk about reserve bookings preferably actually to the March meeting, when by that time we\u2019ve done all our work.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks, Paul. And I would just add that the current SEC rules are still in place, although they\u2019ve come out with a proposal for modification of the definition, but it\u2019s still using prices at a point in time at the end of 2008. And as George mentioned, we may have some preliminary numbers that we can share with you in terms of reserves in the January call, but we don't really finalize all of our work until February and have it available then for the 10-K and then further discussion at the March '09 Analyst Meeting.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks, Paul. May we have the next questioner please?\nOperator: Your next question is from Neil McMahon from Sanford Bernstein. Your question please?\nNeil McMahon: Hi, I've got questions related to your project timing. Just moving on to some of your previous answers, George, you mentioned that Gorgon, you're not planning 3 million - 5 million ton trains and one presumes since it hasn't gone to FID, yet. But there is scope to discuss materials costs and contractor costs. Do you have any rough idea, what timing you would expect Gorgon to come on and at? And if the current credit markets or falling prices for products and services may delay that a little bit?\nGeorge Kirkland: I think may be in a earlier question, I was trying to foreshadow that I actually see a potential advantage for big LNG projects that have not reached FID. The cost reduction of goods and services is really I think, very, very good news for those kind of projects, so, very positive from that point of view. Our long-term view of prices of oil and gas, have not changed, which is how we always looked at our economics. So in some ways with cost of goods and services, I think potentially coming down, it's a benefit to those large projects. And once again it reinforces this financial crisis, reinforces the advantages that companies like Chevron have, we have very, very strong balance sheets and are not, I think, held hostage or to getting loans to do our projects. So, from that perspective, I think, it may actually be a benefit for us in some of our very, very large projects.\nSteve Crowe: I'll just add. We have the advantage of having a very strong balance sheet and we got to this point because we look a long-term view of the commodity price cycle, strengthened our balance sheet when commodity prices were rising, so as to whether a downturn or advantage ourselves of opportunities. We also have the other aspect that George mentioned, and that is, we have a great project queue. So, tremendous strength, but also tremendous opportunities. Neil, do you have a follow-up?\nNeil McMahon: Yes, Steve and I appreciate all of that, and that's good to hear. It was really, again on Gorgan, just a rough timing on when that project would be coming on, I am presuming the second half of the next decade? And then, as we are talking about projects, maybe George could give an update on Jack and St. Malo, as well?\nGeorge Kirkland: Let me deal with Gorgan saying our target is FID in the second half of 2009. So, sometime mid-year or little bit after we would like to be the FID. I would then like to come out as we approach FID and then give a definitive date. I don't think it's quite as long as what you mentioned, I'd pull it back a little bit from there. But, I would much rather talk about that in detail once we get closer to the FID point. Okay, and then on Jack and St. Malo. We still have appraisal wells to complete on both Jack and St. Malo and until we get those appraisal wells drilled and evaluated, we really can't comment on further timing. I would anticipate that we would be able to make pretty strong views on timing for Jack and St. Malo, between the analyst call in late January to the time we get together in March; somewhere in that timeframe, we should have a pretty good idea of our path forward.\nNeil McMahon: Right, thanks.\nGeorge Kirkland: Thanks, Neil. May we have the next questioner, please?\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank. Your question please?\nPaul Sankey: Hi, guys. Just one on upstream, and one on finance, if I could, I\u2019ll slip in a few thoughts to it. Firstly, George you mentioned 2650 would be your production level for 2008 at $70 oil. Could you indicate what level you would expect for 2009, given the impressive list of projects you\u2019ve listed? Secondly, the decline rate towards 4% is what you said. Would that be sensitive to the oil price being lower in terms of how hard you defend that number? And finally, on the upstream side, if you could talk about exploration and any highlights that you\u2019ve got coming up over the coming year? Thanks.\nGeorge Kirkland: It\u2019s a long list there. Let me\u2026\nPaul Sankey: That was one question, George.\nGeorge Kirkland: Very well strung together. The 2009 production number, I\u2019m much preferred to talk about that at the January or have Steve or others talk about it at the January meeting. And I hope everyone recognize that there\u2019s an awful lot of moving parts going on right now. Hurricane restoration has potential significant swings, and as I mentioned in my comments today, three-quarters of the remaining barrels that we have off there are not dependent on what we do; they\u2019re dependent on third-party pipelines. So we have that concern. We have all these projects coming on, and including Tahiti and the timing of all these big projects when they come on, one quarter, one month, all of these make a significant difference. A lot of these points will be nailed down by the end of the year. We are going to know an awful lot about where we are on hurricanes, we're going to know ramp up on Agbami to a much better extent. Blind Faith was going to be owned by then, so we'll have some performance data on it and we'll have a pretty good idea of exact timing of Tahiti, which is a bunch of big barrels for us, so another project where we have high working interest. So from that perspective, we typically give our guidance for 2000 or that year in the January meeting. So we're going to hold with that and we'll give that guidance at the next quarter's call.\nSteve Crowe: I'd just add on top of George's comments for all the reasons that he cited. As we've done year, when we give the guidance for 2009, net of O&G production, we'll ping it off a specific crude price recognized in the workings of various contract agreements overseas can affect net production. I think you had another question on\u2026\nPaul Sankey: Yes, sorry. You mentioned that you implied that it was close to 4% decline rate based on higher activity levels in defending the base. I just wondered if with the lower oil that\u2019s going to be still defendable, I guess it's really a follow-up to the CapEx question in some ways.\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, we've tried to take the price effects out our decline rate analysis and give you numbers that really don\u2019t reflect the price itself. We try to pull the price effects out of there to the best we can.\nPaul Sankey: No, I'm thinking more about activity levels, George? You know are you going to do less, because fuel price is lower?\nGeorge Kirkland: Once again you got to remember, a lot of contracts for rigs you're already set for a year and six months. So there is limited change that you are going to make in a short-term program. And I would tell you, typically, the very strongest returned projects, when you look at rate of returns on your investment tend to be those projects that are off of current infrastructure and tie-ins, so those development wells and workovers tend to have the very, very best economics. I would tell you that we will make decisions during the year for certain contracts as they are coming up if it looks to be advantageous for us to decide to go out to the market and bid for a rig in lieu of doing a contract extension we will do that to make sure we attract the best prices to do our work. So we will make some choices like that, very tactical choices during the year. I can't at this point in time speculate how that will play out, it could have some minor effect on our base decline. But it is just way too early to speculate.\nSteve Crowe: George, the third part of\u2026\nPaul Sankey: Third part of one\u2026\nSteve Crowe: Third part of the first question (inaudible)\u2026\nGeorge Kirkland: Our exploration focus is still very much, in those focus areas I've talked about, we have been drilling wells in Australia, we haven\u2019t made any announcements, but we have been doing quite a bit of work in Australia. And I expect we will cover that later through some announcements. We are just starting several wells in the lower tertiary, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, it's too early to make anything of a report expect the wells have been spuded. And we\u2019re continuing to drill some expiration wells in the focus area of West Africa, but I don\u2019t really have any specific updates beyond that. We\u2019ll give a very broad update and I\u2019d say detailed update once again in our analyst meeting in March.\nPaul Sankey: But the development here, it feels like a quiet year for expiration.\nGeorge Kirkland: Our exploration program, I will tell you, we try to keep it very consistent. We try not to yo-yo it up and down, that\u2019s my expectation again for next year. We always like to drill anywhere from 15 to 20 high impact wells around the world and then of course our large number of appraisal wells and delineation wells. So my expectation would be a program similar to what we\u2019ve done in the last few years. Once again, we don\u2019t like to yo-yo them up and down. We\u2019ve got rig contracts, we plan for the long-term and we try to maintain even this in those programs.\nSteve Crowe: Paul, you had one more question.\nPaul Sankey: Yes, very quickly, one for you Steve, and that would be pension, anything to say about pension funding and the outlook there. Thanks, so I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks, Paul. Certainly the market value of our Pension Trust Fund obviously has gone down with the market in the last several months. We don\u2019t have any required funding requirements under the PPA or [RISSA]. As you may recall, particularly earlier in this decade, we have an approach towards funding that we call opportunistic funding. When we have sufficient cash or cash flows and can assure ourselves of tax deductibility and making a contribution. I guess, I would say at this juncture the disclosures that Chevron\u2019s made in its 10-K and 10-Q still pertain, including our ongoing economic review to fund more than we have there, indicated in our SEC filings. So keeping in mind that the PBO obligation under PPA discount rules results in higher discount rates. The magnitude of the funding is better than you might think just looking at the reduction in the asset values. So I guess, I\u2019d take you back to our disclosures that we have made in earlier 10-Qs and the one that you will see in our 10-Q next week. May we have the next questioner please?\nOperator: The next question is from Michael LaMotte of JPMorgan. Your question please?\nMichael LaMotte: Thanks. Good Morning, guys. I\u2019d like to follow-up on this base decline number George, if I could quickly. In slide 13, 55,000 barrel a day number implies a 2.1% rate, at the analyst meeting in March, the same slide showing \u201907 versus \u201906 was about 1% decline. And I know a 1.6%, I guess. In your remarks you mentioned operating challenges in Azerbaijan is one of the reasons for the base decline. The question I am asking is, is it all Azerbaijan? Are there issues related to that, that explain that whole delta and can 2% hold?\nGeorge Kirkland: I keep going back and we track this base business very closely, because we have good success, it has been lower for now, I think probably 4-5 quarters less than the 4% to 5%. I would tell everybody, remember those barrels are in the bank, moved our production up and held our production. So that\u2019s a real positive, but I tried to also give a little color on this 55 that there were other things going on in there, that benefited our base and reduced that decline. One of those was a unitization agreement in Indonesia that we highlighted in an earlier call; I believe that was a first quarter call.\nSteve Crowe: It was first quarter.\nGeorge Kirkland: First quarter call and that had an impact, and we've also had better marketing results, gas sales in the Asia-Pacific region that in effect has raised the amount of base production we've had there. So, it's not really a fair comparison on base decline without taking that into effect, and when you add those pieces back, it gets back to the low end of this. It gets back in the 4% range, approximately. So, we feel good for planning purposes. We're going to continue to hold this 4% to 5% as kind of our planning model. But then, when we look at our actuals and the processes we put in place, we're hopeful that we're going to continue to see, that we're able to do a little bit better than that. So, we're going to look back at performance and we're going to plan forward, at least for some period of time, still in this 4% to 5% range.\nSteve Crowe: Mike, do you have a follow-up?\nMichael LaMotte: I do. Thank you for that color, George. If you wouldn't mind expanding a bit on the impairment to North Sea assets, as well?\nSteve Crowe: Jim, do you want to feel that one?\nJim Aleveras: Yes. We had impairment of number of very small fields in the Dutch North Sea, as well as the U.K. North Sea, these are mature fields, and they are very small partially, in terms of production. So, those are not tremendously material to us.\nSteve Crowe: They were all reaching the end of their productive lives. So, we took the asset values down.\nMichael LaMotte: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nSteve Crowe: You bet. May we have our next questioner, please?\nOperator: Your next question is from Erik Mielke from Merrill Lynch. Your question please?\nErik Mielke: Good morning, gentlemen. I have two questions, the first one for George, and the second one for Steve, probably. Firstly, on the partition neutral zone in Saudi, and I understand that you are not willing to get into a huge reserve discussion at this point. But can you clarify whether the extension of the contract would automatically lead to additional reserves being bookable for you?\nGeorge Kirkland: Our normal reserve process only allows us to book reserves through the existing contract life; the contract life without the extension would have been ending in February of 2009, and now it will go to 2039. So, with that extended period, there will be proved reserves that will be booked as a part of that extension.\nErik Mielke: It's very clear. Thanks.\nSteve Crowe: And do you have another?\nErik Mielke: Yes. My second question is more on cash management. If I hear you correctly, it sounds like CapEx is something that you intend to keep at current levels, and even if prices were to go let's say $10 lower than where they are today. And for the rest of your cash management, how do you balance between holding cash, accelerating buybacks, or scaling back buybacks, and potentially increasing dividends? And then also, can you clarify where are you going to keep your cash?\nGeorge Kirkland: Thanks, Erik. Well, I'll begin on a short-term issue. It's our intention here in the fourth quarter to maintain the share buyback pace at $2 billion in the fourth quarter, just as we've done for the last five quarters. In terms of cash management and balancing, I think first and foremost, we want to make sure we fund the capital program that we feel is such a robust program with a very deep queue. So that's our first and foremost use of operating cash. Secondly, we are mindful of our 21, 22 year record of increasing annual payouts and our dividend, and would fully want to maintain that progress overtime. Thirdly, as I had alluded before, we do want to maintain a strong balance sheet through the commodity price cycle and I think we're in enviable position, right now, as having one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. As to share buybacks, we take all of the other considerations into account and make a determination as to whether or not there is enough of a cash flywheel to fund further buybacks. We take a look at economic conditions, market conditions going forward and would plan on giving guidance to the investment community, just as we're doing now at the call each quarter, for at least, one quarter, ahead. But as for right now, we're coming off two quarters of consecutive record earnings, a very, very strong balance sheet, strong cash flows, more cash than debt and we see another $2 billion here in the buybacks, in the fourth quarter. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Peter McNally from Galleon. Your question please?\nPeter McNally: My question has been answered. Thank you.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks, Peter. Can we have the next questioner please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Gilman from Benchmark. Your question please?\nMark Gilman: Guys, good morning, good afternoon. George, I am wondering if you could tell me associated with the new concession of the partition neutral zone, did you benefit or would you benefit from any change in fiscal terms, should you decide to proceed with the full field steam flood there?\nGeorge Kirkland: Mark, first off, it's an extension of the existing contract there and at this point in time, I will not discuss the terms of a future full field steam development. I would rather hold that off until we get closure to that decision point.\nMark Gilman: Okay. Let me turn to my follow-up. I believe you received approval to proceed with them across a straight development project or with respect to some of the resources that [UNICCO] had identified years ago. I am curious as to whether that gas is to go to Bontang or to be dedicated to the domestic market and is there an agreement to allow for [protomania] to participate as an equity partner.\nGeorge Kirkland: Mark, that agreement to develop and the plan of development there has not been fully approved. So, we don't have all the approvals yet on that. So, at this point, I really can't talk about it because we don't have all the approvals. It has been reported in the press a couple of times but all the pieces have not been put together, so it has not been reported correctly.\nMark Gilman: Okay. Since I got two strikes, let me try one more quickly. George with respect to the production sharing contract impacts that you'd cited in several of your slides. Can you segment that between those losses that would be considered permanent associated with threshold return and/or full capital cost recovery versus those reductions that are associated more with operating cost and continuing capital cost recovery?\nGeorge Kirkland: Mark, I can't do that at this time. That's a lot of detail. I will tell you, some of it has been related to triggers, in other words, return triggers that will change the distribution in effect of profit oil. So, we have that. We have some that is royalty pieces, which reach triggers with higher royalty rates. But, first off, I don't think we ever would try to share that kind of detail, that's an awful lot of detail. We'd rather try to give you each year kind of a guideline that kind of matches what we think is going to happen for the year at a price scenario or a price range. This last year, we've been telling you it's been about $2 for every dollar a barrel impact on price, it's about 2000 barrels per day change and that's kind of been what it has, we will update that again for the year 2009, which we will be once again looking-forward and look at price impacts and production impacts together.\nSteve Crowe: Mark, what we will try to do on the January call then is, when we give our guidance for 2009 production at a specified price. Based on that specified price, we'll try to give the investment community a rule a thumb to use to know how to adjust that if prices are above or below that amount.\nMark Gilman: Okay, guys thanks. I'm taking my back and going back to the dugout.\nSteve Crowe: Okay, Mark. May we have the next questioner please?\nOperator: Our final question today is from Neil McMahon of Sanford Bernstein. Your question please?\nNeil McMahon: Hi. Just not really a follow-up, something a bit different for you, Steve. What was the tax rate difference between the second quarter and the third quarter?\nSteve Crowe: Of this year?\nNeil McMahon: Of this year, yes.\nSteve Crowe: In the third quarter our tax rate was just about 45%. And in the second quarter it was about 49% and below a rate for the third quarter of this year was associated with a greater proportion of income being earned in tax jurisdictions with lower tax rates. But we also have an impact in the second quarter of a reduction in the tax rate in Bangladesh. So, on an ongoing basis, as we have guided in the past, allowing for the different taxing jurisdictions and being an integrative company, our guidance would be to use sort of an average rate of about 45% or in that neighborhood at least.\nNeil McMahon: Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you.\nSteve Crowe: Thanks, Neil. Mark or Matt, are there any other questioners in line?\nOperator: We have no further question as this time.\nSteve Crowe: Okay. Well, thank you, Matt. In closing, let me say that we appreciate everybody\u2019s participation on today\u2019s call. And I especially want to thank each of these analysts on behalf of all the participants for their questions during this morning session. Matt, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-08-02 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Matt and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Steve Crowe. Please go ahead, sir.\nSteve J. Crowe: Thanks, Matt. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Jim Aleveras, General Manager of Investor Relations, is on the call with me. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2008. We will refer to the slides that are available on the web. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2. I\u2019ll begin with slide 3, which provides an overview of our financial performance. The company\u2019s second quarter earnings were a record $6 billion, or $2.90 per diluted share. Our second quarter 2008 results were up 11% from the second quarter 2007. Higher crude oil prices benefited our upstream performance but had a negative impact on our downstream business. The second quarter of last year included a $500 million net gain on the sale of an investment and redemption of debt. Second quarter 2008 earnings rose over 15% compared with the first quarter of 2008, which Jim will discuss shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 23%. The debt ratio was below 8% at the end of June. Capital and exploratory spending was $5.2 billion for the quarter. In addition to the $2 billion of stock buy-backs, we increased the second quarter dividend 12%. Jim will now take us through the quarterly comparisons. Jim.\nJim Aleveras: Thanks, Steve. My remarks compare results of the second quarter 2008 with the first quarter 2008. As a reminder, our earnings release compared second quarter 2008 with the same quarter a year ago. Turning to slide 4, second quarter net income was $800 million higher than the first quarter. Starting with the left side of the chart, higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited the company\u2019s worldwide upstream results. At the same time, the significant increase in crude oil prices adversely affected the downstream segment. The variance in the residual other bar primarily reflects higher charges at the corporate level for environmental remediation and tax adjustments. Slide 5 summarizes the results of our U.S. upstream operations, which improved by about $590 million between quarters. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $775 million. Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realization was up about $24.30 per barrel between consecutive quarters. This was less than the nearly $26 increase in WTI\u2019s spot prices between quarters, since much of our Gulf of Mexico crude oil production is priced on a lagged basis. Production volumes were down 2% between quarters, largely due to operational downtime and normal fuel declines. This reduced earnings by $30 million. Higher operating expenses reduced earnings by $70 million. Fuel, steam, and utility costs increased, as did maintenance expenses. The other bar is the net of everything else, including various gas marketing effects. Turning to slide 6, international upstream earnings for the second quarter were about $1.5 billion higher than the first quarter\u2019s results. Higher oil and gas prices increased earnings by nearly $1.3 billion. Our average unit realization for liquids rose by $24.30 per barrel between sequential quarters, about the same as the average brent spot price increase. An increase in liftings contributed $130 million to the second quarter. Liftings were up primarily in Tengiz, the U.K., and China. Overall liftings were roughly in balance for the first half of the year after our under-lifted position in the first quarter. Operating expense reduced earnings by $90 million, mainly in the U.K., Kazakhstan and Indonesia. The other bar reflects the net of many unrelated items. The largest item was a favorable swing in foreign exchange effects. Among the offsetting items, exploration expense was higher in the second quarter. Slide 7 summarizes the change in worldwide oil equivalent production, including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada. Production fell by 62,000 barrels per day, or 2% between quarters. U.S. production declined 13,000 barrels per day due to operational down time and normal field declines that I mentioned. Outside the U.S., overall production dropped 49,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. However, we estimate that the impact of higher prices reduced production by about 75,000 barrels per day between sequential quarters. So absent price effects, volumes would have been up between quarters. I\u2019ll elaborate on this in a moment. Indonesia production was impacted by prices but the largest effect was the absence of the one-time benefit of a favorable gas unitization agreement that we discussed on the conference call last quarter. While gross production at Tengiz continued to ramp up with our expansion project, both Tengiz and Karachaganak net volumes were affected by higher prices. Turning to our production outlook for 2008, total OEG production for the first six months of 2008 was 2.57 million barrels per day. During this period, WTI prices averaged just over $110 per barrel. Our production target for 2008, which assumed $70 per barrel WTI, was 2.65 million barrels per day. Absent the price effects under production sharing and variable royalty agreements, our production for the first half would have been on track with our full year production target of $2.65 million barrels per day. This production level reflected strong base business performance without significant contributions from several 2008 major project start-ups. Our project start-ups will increase production during the second half of the year and, adjusting for price effects, we expect to meet or exceed our volume target for the year. Steve will provide a brief update on our major projects at the end of our presentation. We reviewed our rule of thumb as prices have moved far above $70 per barrel, and we believe the rule of thumb is still applicable at the current price level. That is to say, a $1 per barrel increase in prices leads to about a 2,000 barrel per day reduction in our net production volumes for the year. However, I would like to reemphasize the caveats we\u2019ve given you about this rule of thumb. The calculation of price impacts includes many variables, including the interaction of prices and costs, very specific contract thresholds and terms and so forth. The rule of thumb is our best estimate of the impact for 2008, but results will vary when making comparisons between periods. For example, because certain thresholds were met in the second quarter, the rule of thumb does not work when comparing the first and second quarters of 2008. Each dollar change in price had an impact of over 3,000 barrels per day in this particular comparison. We\u2019ll continue to update you as we move through this very volatile environment. Turning to slide 8, our U.S. downstream operations moved from break even to a loss of about $680 million in the second quarter. Industry refining margins improved in the second quarter, although marketing indicator margins weakened, particularly on the west coast. On balance, indicator margins suggest a $305 million benefit. WTI prices rose more than $38 per barrel from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter. This compares to an increase of less than $6 per barrel during the first quarter. This truly extraordinary crude price spike in the second quarter reduced the U.S. downstream earnings by $490 million between quarters. The $490 million is shown on the bar labeled timing effects. Of the $490 million, about $280 million reflected the impact of provisionally priced foreign crude. This crude is priced on a delivered basis, although we take title to it when it is lifted. We typically have about 13 million to 15 million barrels of provisionally priced crude in transit to the U.S. west coast. These barrels are effectively marked to market at the end of each period. A second timing effect accounted for $110 million of the $490 million change between quarters. We used derivatives to convert crudes, including crudes that are not provisionally priced, from the acquisition price to the price at the time they are run. As prices went up dramatically during the second quarter, this resulted in derivative losses. The balance of timing effects between quarters reflected a number of supply related activities, including mark-to-market losses on derivatives related to a long-term contract. Moving to the next bar, we had an unfavorable variance of $300 million between quarters, due to refinery shut-down effects. Almost all of these were planned shutdowns and we previously cautioned that 2008 would be a heavy planned shutdown period for us. The adverse $300 million variance reflects both the direct operating expense and the lost margin capture as we purchased more expensive feed stocks and intermediates during the refinery shutdowns. Most of the difference between quarters was due to our Pascagoula refinery, where both the number one crude unit and coker were down during the second quarter. Planned shutdowns at El Segundo and [Hawaii] were much smaller factors. Our 2008 maintenance schedule indicates that essentially all of our major U.S. planned shutdowns were completed in the first half of 2008. Excluding the operating expense related to refinery shutdowns, other OpEx was $145 million higher in the second quarter. Many factors were involved here, including higher fuel costs. The other bar on the chart is an unfavorable variance of $56 million, which primarily reflects minor pipeline impairments. Turning to slide 9, international downstream earnings fell $300 million from the first quarter\u2019s results. Refining indicator margins improved while marketing margins were mixed across our international geographic areas. On balance, company margins were a $185 million benefit between quarters. Volumetric effects were a $25 million adverse variance. This primarily reflected the unplanned shutdowns at the Pembroke refinery in Wales. We estimate the overall impact of all international refinery downtime between quarters to be an unfavorable variance of $32 million, which reflects OpEx as well as volume and feedstock impacts. As we saw in the United States, international downstream timing effects were a major factor in the adverse change between quarters, as the price of crude and petroleum products increased very significantly over the course of the second quarter. Two-thirds of the $225 million shown as timing effects was related to long haul sales of equity crude and refined products. For select cargos, we often use derivatives to lock in a margin above the cost of transportation. During periods of rapidly increasing prices, this can lead to derivative losses. The majority of this timing effect is related to delivered sales of partition neutral zone equity crude and exports of refined products from our Pembroke refinery to third parties. The balance of the timing effect is primarily due to losses on derivatives used to convert crude pricing to the time of refinery run. There was also a factor involved here regarding the changes in inventory. The next bar shows operating expense was a $140 million unfavorable variance between quarters. A number of different items affected the various geographic regions. There was not a pattern to the components of the $140 million change. The other bar shows a $95 million reduction between quarters, and this primarily reflects lower foreign exchange gains, as well as an adverse swing in tax items. Slide 10 shows that earnings from chemical operations were $41 million in the second quarter, compared with $43 million in the first quarter. Results for olefins fell on lower margins and volumes, as well as higher expense. Aromatics results were also affected by lower volumes and higher operating expenses. Additionally, shutdown activity reduce aromatics results. The other bar on this chart shows a favorable $26 million variance between quarters. This reflects the absence of a $40 million environmental provision we mentioned on last quarter\u2019s conference call, partly offset by lower additive margins. Turning to slide 11, which covers all other, second quarter results were net charges of $580 million compared to net charges of $255 million in the first quarter. The $210 million variance reflects environmental provisions related to legacy Texaco and Unocal downstream assets. Since these assets were sold prior to Chevron acquiring their parent companies, the impact was included here rather than in the downstream segment. Tax items were an $80 million unfavorable variance. The other bar reflects the net of many unrelated items. Before I turn things back over to Steve, I would just like to briefly recap the second quarter\u2019s results. First, upstream results were very strong, in line with the indicators in our July 10th interim update. Second, we experienced a sharp decline in downstream performance due to timing effects and refinery downtime, as we discussed in the interim update. Finally, as we projected, chemical results were flat between sequential quarters and our all other charges were significantly higher than the standard guidance range due to environmental remediation charges. That completes my variance analysis for the quarter. Back over to you, Steve.\nSteve J. Crowe: Thanks, Jim. Before opening the call to questions, I would like to highlight the significant progress we\u2019ve made on some of our major capital projects. Please turn to slide 12. First up is our Agbami project, offshore Nigeria. Yesterday, we announced that Agbami had begun production. Chevron is the operator with a 68% interest in this world class deepwater project. Agbami\u2019s initial gross OEG production is expected to quickly ramp up to more than 100,000 barrels per day. We anticipate this reach 250,000 barrels per day by the end of 2009. In the U.K., our partner recently announced first production for the Callanish-Brodgar fields, also known as the Brittania satellite development. At the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan, our phased expansion remains on schedule for full facility start-up this quarter. The first phase, which began late last year, added nearly 90,000 barrels per day of total production during the second quarter. The second phase of production is now complete and we\u2019re doing the major turnaround, final tie-ins, and commissioning. As a result, there will be a brief drop in production of about 25,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. With full facility start-up, we anticipate the project will add 240,000 barrels a day of production, increasing Tengiz\u2019s total capacity from 300,000 to 540,000 barrels per day. In the Gulf of Mexico, we completed our plan to retrofit and tension all eight mooring lines on our Blind Faith facility. We are continuing with commissioning work, having installed all four of the risers. We expect start-up later this year. It\u2019s difficult to be more specific about the timing as weather could impact our commissioning efforts. In Australia, the Northwest Shelf fifth train, fifth LNG train is in the midst of commissioning with an anticipated first cargo in the fourth quarter. In Brazil, our Frade project is on track for a 2009 start-up. At our Tahiti facility in the Gulf of Mexico, the production spar has been moored, the installation of sub-sea flow lines and risers is nearly complete, and the first of three major topside modules was installed last week. We expect to install the other two topside modules this quarter. The Tahiti project remains on schedule for first production in the third quarter 2009. In Angola, our Tombua Landana project is also on schedule for first production next year. In summary, our major projects are on track to deliver significant new volumes. That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll now take you questions. One question and one follow-up per caller, please. Matt, would you open up the lines for questions?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.\nArjun Murti: Thank you. Thanks for the project update. I was wondering if you could provide a similar update on some of your exploration plans, I guess in particular the status of some of the key lower tertiary projects, Jack in particular, St. Malo. If you could provide an update on exploration in general but most notably the lower tertiary, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nSteve J. Crowe: Well, we\u2019re looking at Jack and St. Malo presently. We have another well that will be completed later in the year. We\u2019re giving consideration as to whether or not we can tie back those two projects, Jack and St. Malo, one of which came from Unocal and one of which is a legacy Chevron one, and consider developing the two of them in tandem. We\u2019ll have more to say about the progress of the lower tertiary as we get a little deeper in the year and can probably give you a more definitive update on our next conference call. Arjun, did you have a follow-up question?\nArjun Murti: Are those expected to be sanctioned this year, and does the fact that you are considering a joint development speak to any disappointment or update in terms of the resource potential of either or both together?\nSteve J. Crowe: I think the consideration of joining those two projects together really speaks to the opportunity to reduce costs in the current environment and produce them in tandem as a more efficient way of developing the resource.\nArjun Murti: It\u2019s an efficiency consideration?\nSteve J. Crowe: Primarily.\nArjun Murti: And I\u2019m sorry, do you think we\u2019ll be expecting a sanction decision this year or is that an \u201909 or later kind of a thing?\nSteve J. Crowe: That will be outside of 2008.\nArjun Murti: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Neil McMahon of Sanford Bernstein.\nNeil McMahon: Just really on some of the numbers in today\u2019s call that Jim ran through on the variance analysis; looking at the OpEx reduction both in the U.S. but more importantly in international, which is a bit strange, given higher royalties and an inflation environment. I was wondering to what extent -- well, first of all really why that OpEx reduction took place from the first quarter to second quarter, and in particular related to what\u2019s going on in Kazakhstan with some of your partners in the Karachaganak field seeing increased charges associated with changes in the fiscal terms in that country.\nSteve J. Crowe: Well, let me give a first correction, I think, Neil. As Jim was going through the variance analyses say on the U.S. upstream, we indicated on our, on slide five that operating expense was higher in the second quarter in comparison to the first quarter by about $70 million after tax, mainly reflecting, as you would expect, higher fuel costs and utility costs, along with higher maintenance. So actually the costs were higher in the second than in the first quarter.\nJim Aleveras: Neil, with regard to the international upstream, you will see OpEx down a little bit but the biggest factor there was simply a number of different things in our various U.K., Kazakhstan, and Indonesia operations.\nNeil McMahon: I\u2019m just sort of struggling why it\u2019s dropped, given the fact that BG on their conference call were talking about the fact that under duress, or -- maybe that wasn\u2019t the word they used but they were paying new taxes associated with the fiscal change in Kazakhstan. That\u2019s all. It seems strange that you have gone down whereas they went up.\nJim Aleveras: Neil, perhaps it\u2019s a semantic issue here. When we\u2019re showing OpEx as a negative, what we\u2019re saying is it\u2019s a negative to P&L. We start with our income from the first quarter and we end with our income in the second quarter, so when OpEx is a negative, what it means is it\u2019s a detraction from our earnings in the second quarter.\nNeil McMahon: Right, I understand that but you did say that it went down. That\u2019s all.\nJim Aleveras: No, we said OpEx was a negative. If you look at the international upstream chart, it\u2019s a negative $90 million to earnings, so that\u2019s OpEx actually going up. It\u2019s reducing earnings by $90 million.\nNeil McMahon: Okay, I thought you said a few minutes ago that things got better in Kazakhstan, but that\u2019s fine. Maybe as a follow-up then, just on the environmental charge under corporate, maybe you could just walk through that, since you did say you had disposed of those assets, or maybe my hearing has completely gone.\nSteve J. Crowe: Well, as we had foreshadowed in the interim update on July 10th, certain of the environment provisions or obligations that we have that are connected with legacy operations of Texaco or Unocal, we still are obliged per certain of the contractual arrangements to effect the environment clean-up or remediation. It so happened that here in the second quarter, for primarily the Unocal but also Texaco operations that are no longer operating, they\u2019ve been disposed of, certain events have occurred where we thought it was appropriate for the accounting rules to recognize the increased liability. So that was the fundamental driver for that increase of $210 million between the first and second quarters of this year.\nNeil McMahon: Steve, can you tell us where they are or what the chances are that this sort of thing is going to happen again on some of those assets?\nSteve J. Crowe: Well, there were a variety of things, some of which were marketing related. Operations that Unocal had that have since been sold twice. Some of them are connected with refinery and terminal locations, both legacy -- primarily legacy Texaco. And those things occur driven by events, but you will have noticed I think over the last year or so that our recognition of environment expenses, whether it be for currently owned and operated operations or those previously disposed of are a bit more -- occur more regularly during the course of the year. But it\u2019s very hard to give you a prediction as to what the ratable pace would be because it\u2019s driven by events and they tend to come based on the situation.\nNeil McMahon: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: Good morning, gentlemen. I got a little bit confused regarding your overall statements about volumes for the year. You said you at 2537, 2.5 million and that you would otherwise have been at your target but for the PSC and other effects of 2650. You then subsequently said that you expect still to meet the target by the end of the year, was it, or could you just clarify? I didn\u2019t quite understand what you were saying. Do you mean that you are going to still be at 2537 by the end of the year, or are you going to hit --\nSteve J. Crowe: I\u2019ll let Jim cover that.\nJim Aleveras: Paul, what we are saying is that we expect to meet or exceed the 2.65 that we talked about at $70 a barrel oil at our March meeting, but that\u2019s adjusted for prices. Right now, we\u2019re in a very volatile pricing environment so if prices stay above $70, we\u2019ll come in below that but we\u2019ll give you a reconciliation back to that that will explain the PSC effects that cause it.\nPaul Sankey: But the point I was making was that you said that at the current level, effectively but for those effects, the 2.5 level but for those effects amount to the 2.6, if you like, which would then to me suggest that there\u2019s no growth in the second half.\nJim Aleveras: No, we expect to meet or exceed, and I\u2019ll put exceed in italics, if that helps, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: Okay, I\u2019ve got you, I think.\nSteve J. Crowe: So what we\u2019re saying again, for those on the phone, is we are reaffirming our production guidance earlier in the year that we\u2019ll have net production of 2.65 at a $70 per barrel average price for the year. And Jim also mentioned that it still looks appropriate as you make those adjustments because of higher print prices, a two-to-one ration, such that for every dollar increase above the $70, you could anticipate roughly a 2,000 barrel a day reduction in net production.\nPaul Sankey: Okay, if I could take my follow-up, you were very clear on Agbami. On Tengiz, you mentioned that you will be down in 3Q. Could you just give us the overall levels? You mentioned you\u2019d be down I think 25,000 a day. Could you just give us the overall levels, even at the Kazakhstan level, that would be fine. And then if you could also just clarify the exit rate for \u201908, because you said there the capacity I think is 240 a day. But if you could just clarify where you think you\u2019ll be by the end of the year, that\u2019s great. Thank you.\nJim Aleveras: Well, let\u2019s take the first one first. Paul, we mentioned the 25,000 barrel a day reduction in the current quarter simply to alert people that as we tie in the facilities and we bring the second generation plan on stream, we will have to reduce production a little bit as we are tying everything back together.\nPaul Sankey: And that will be down to what level, Jim?\nJim Aleveras: Right now, we\u2019re running close to 400,000 barrels  day on a gross 100% basis.\nPaul Sankey: And that\u2019s pre the 25, right?\nJim Aleveras: Yes, that\u2019s correct. So there will be a slight reduction in overall production just as we tie everything together and get the plant up and running. In terms of the exit rate from 2008, going into 2009 it\u2019s a little too early to tell yet. We certainly have achieved, as we promised, the 90,000 barrel a day improvement from the first phase of the project, the sour gas injection.\nSteve J. Crowe: But it will be ramping up to the expected 540,000 barrels a day on a total project -- just don\u2019t want to quote an exact number as we exit out 2008 and go into 2009.\nJim Aleveras: But we\u2019re certainly going to expect a pretty prompt increase once we get out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter.\nSteve J. Crowe: That\u2019s correct. Thanks very much, Paul.\nOperator: Our next question is from  Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers.\nPaul Cheng: With Agbami coming on stream and also a number of projects, can you maybe share with us the kind of return and profitability on those new projects compared to your existing one? It looked like Agbami should be extremely profitable, so I\u2019m wondering if you can shed some light.\nSteve J. Crowe: Well, we typically wouldn\u2019t talk about the economics of a specific project, which obviously get into a lot of the fiscal terms that we have in each of those operations, but Agbami will be a very profitable project for us. It will be returning cash to us on a prompt basis. As you know, it\u2019s a light oil condensate project and ought to have a very handsome rate of return. Our expectation, sort of harkening back to an earlier question on ramp-up is that we probably will see as the wells come on production reaching 100,000 barrels a day in the early part of next year, and then as we mentioned before, moving up to the 250,000 barrels a day by the end of 2009. But I think a takeaway from that last chart that I showed in the prepared remarks is we\u2019ve got a long and healthy list of projects, some of which have come on, some of which are right in the midst of being commissioned, and some are coming on and right on schedule for 2009. So I think our production, which of course net production will be influenced by prices and the way variable royalty mechanisms work and production sharing agreements, but these large projects are all lined up and as you can see, it\u2019s quite a long list and probably will differentiate Chevron versus a lot of our competitors. I think it\u2019s a major difference. We\u2019ve been talking about it for a couple of years now, but they\u2019re ready.\nPaul Cheng: Steve, what\u2019s your current production in Agbami at this point?\nSteve J. Crowe: Well, Agbami started up literally on Tuesday of this week, as I recall, and so as the wells come on it will be ramping up. The last I saw, and it changes all the time, Paul, but the last I saw was a day or so ago and it was about 20,000 barrels a day. But it ramps up over time, so don\u2019t put any specific number -- it\u2019s a function of when the wells come on. But as I mentioned, as they do come on, we anticipate about 100,000 barrels a day in early 2009.\nPaul Cheng: Can I ask a follow-up and maybe conceptual question about the timing effect losses in your downstream operation?\nSteve J. Crowe: Sure.\nPaul Cheng: I understand the price finalization impact related to long haul crude supply in Saudi Arabia and -- so that\u2019s really no big deal on that. What I\u2019m not quite sure I understand why we even use a derivative for -- let\u2019s say if your own equity crude oil you sell, I think -- based on what you guys describe is that you use derivative to hedge whatever is the price during that journey, that shipping time, whether it\u2019s 20 days or 40 days, given that no one really can foresee what is the price direction for the next 20, 40 days, so arguably you have 50% of the time you make money; 50% of the time, you lose money in that derivative trade. And given Chevron has no concern about liquidity or anything, why we even bother to do that?\nJim Aleveras: The reason we did that was to match the cost of crude that we purchased to the time that it\u2019s run in the refinery to get the margins for the day.\nPaul Cheng: But why do we even bother, Jim? That\u2019s my question.\nJim Aleveras: Well --\nPaul Cheng: I mean, over time, it makes no difference.\nJim Aleveras: But Paul, what we are trying to do there is just lock in a refining margin, which historically refining margins have fluctuated and we want to get refining margin of the day. As we have done this, especially in the second quarter during a period of very, very rapid price changes, we\u2019ve seen that this added volatility to our earnings. That volatility is something that we don\u2019t find acceptable and we have curtailed that program to a considerable extent in the second quarter. So going forward, you can expect to see much smaller effects from this.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Thank you.\nSteve J. Crowe: Let me just reiterate a couple of points; in as much of the timing effects were significant in looking at our results, in light of our second quarter results, we\u2019re looking at everything that impacts our downstream performance. But let me make it clear -- our strategy for the downstream business hasn\u2019t changed. We are continuing to work on rationalizing our portfolio to eliminate less profitable assets and to reduce the capital employed in our marketing network, while maintaining our brand uplift. We are absolutely focused on refinery reliability and selective investments to improve refinery performance. But we are also looking at the tactical issues, as Jim mentioned, like the use of derivatives and other factors that sometimes add perhaps unnecessary volatility to our reported results. Thanks for your call and questions, Paul. May we have the next question?\nOperator: Our next question is from Kate Lucas of J.P. Morgan.\nKate Lucas: Good morning, gentlemen. Can you just comment a little bit on how, on the progress of the steam flood technology that you are using or implementing in the neutral zone? Specifically, any challenges with the steam flood or the carbonate reservoir? And then, can you comment on whether you are able to source the natural gas and water without any issues?\nSteve J. Crowe: Thanks, Kate. As you know, we are in a pilot project in the PNZ to see if the technology would be applicable to carbonate formation. As far as I\u2019m aware, good progress is being made and as you\u2019re also aware, we\u2019re doing that early pilot in the partition neutral zone, which has its concession ending in the early part of 2009. This is a 60-year concession and we\u2019re very optimistic that that concession will be extended but it\u2019s too early at this point on the call to confirm it definitively. But all indications are from the pilot steam project that things are progressing as we had anticipated.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Mielke of Merrill Lynch.\nErik Mielke: We\u2019ve been through most of my questions; just a couple of quick follow-ups. In the discussion earlier with Neil on international operating costs during the second quarter, I recognize that there was an increase during the quarter but the rate of increase was perhaps less than we would have expected. Is that because of the volume mix effect or is it part of underlying cost improvements that you\u2019ve previously discussed?\nJim Aleveras: It\u2019s a combination of a number of things, Erik. If we look at our operating expense, what we are seeing is higher costs in a lot of areas, but we did have some work over costs in West Africa that affected the prior period that are not in the current period.\nSteve J. Crowe: Hope that helps.\nErik Mielke: It does indeed. And then finally, just looking at politics and the fact that by the time we have the next call, we\u2019ll be right in the middle of the elections, we\u2019ve had an announcement today from one of the two candidates that they are considering windfall taxes to finance a so-called energy rebate. What are you hearing from your contacts in Washington when it comes to the outlook for taxation on U.S. oil companies? And if you have any comment on what the impact will be for the different proposals on CO2 cap and trade for your business.\nSteve J. Crowe: Well, it\u2019s again very early with respect to the measurement of the impact of the various CO2 proposals that have been floated around for the last year or so. As far as windfall profits tax is concerned, we have over the last year seen a number of proposals tabled, some were windfall profit tax, some were related to use of foreign tax credits, some were connected with the sustained usability of LIFO. At this juncture up to this point, those have all not passed muster but again, it depends on the nature and terms of any legislation that might be forthcoming in a new administration down the road, so it really much depends on the form of any additional taxation. Hard to speculate until you know all the details. Erik, do you have any other questions?\nErik Mielke: No, that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Gammel of Macquarie.\nJason Gammel: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask a question about the timing of the Pascagoula coker turnaround. From an historic margin capture standpoint, the second quarter would seem to be counterintuitive for planning a two-month turnaround on a coker. Can you shed any light into that decision-making process?\nJim Aleveras: Let me take a swipe at that. The whole issue of bringing a coker down is a very, very complex issue that we\u2019re very conscious the timing is important in terms of scheduling a turnaround because of the impact on margins. If we look at the light heavy differential as a key proxy for coker profitability we don\u2019t find that it follows a consistent pattern between the first and second quarter. So in the 2003, 2005 period, light heavy differentials were actually higher in the first quarter than the second quarter. You just can\u2019t change a major refinery turnaround once you see actual margins coming through the market on a weekly or a monthly basis. In Pascagoula, for example, the crude unit and coker shutdowns during the second quarter were very major undertakings involving thousands of temporary workers. And the Pascagoula coker had run five years since its last scheduled turnaround. We simply were not in the position to second-guess the market as the market evolved in 2008 to get the timing exactly where you would have liked to have gotten it in hindsight to capture the best margins.\nSteve J. Crowe: I think I would add as well two other points, Jason; one, there was a lot of activity with respect to bringing back the other crude unit in the first quarter, so there really wasn\u2019t an opportunity to accelerate it by a quarter or two if you had perceived a different light heavy differential in the short-term. But the other point that I would make is, as Jim had alluded to, almost all of our schedule maintenance here in the U.S. for 2008 is behind us, so we would expect to have increased refinery availability during the second half of the year.\nJason Gammel: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful, guys. Maybe as a follow-up, I could ask about the decline in branded gasoline sales? It looks to be down about 5% year over year. Is that purely a demand function or are there some divestitures that played a role in that as well?\nJim Aleveras: It\u2019s largely a demand function, Jason. What we are seeing is a higher amount of demand decrease in the U.S. West Coast than we are seeing in other parts of the country, and of course Chevron is disproportionately exposed to the U.S. West Coast. We\u2019ve seen this in prior periods as well when California was disproportionately hit in the early 1990s as the defense contractors exited the state, and in the late 1990s as the dot.com bubble burst. In each case, we\u2019ve seen California rebound. Right now, California is being disproportionately hit by the housing and credit crisis, and this has created what we feel is a negative consumer sentiment that\u2019s causing people to do less discretionary driving. Long-term, we\u2019re very bullish about California. We\u2019ve seen California knocked down twice in the last decade. The exit of the defense contractors was a huge impact on California. The dot.com bubble was a huge impact on California, and California unemployment rates had run 1.5 times the national average. So there\u2019s a lot of consumer sentiment going on here and we\u2019re just in the midst of this for a short period of time. We don\u2019t know what the future holds but in the past, California has wobbled around more than the country has but it\u2019s always come back. So we\u2019re optimistic about the future but for the moment, we are being disproportionately affected by our exposure to the U.S. West Coast.\nSteve J. Crowe: Jason, just to close that off, we really don\u2019t have any divestments that are impacting the lower branded gas sales. It\u2019s all a function of industry market demand.\nJason Gammel: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from [Wasim Khalil] of HSBC.\nWasim Khalil: I was just wondering if you could perhaps give us a little bit more information on the partition neutral -- I believe the lady earlier from J.P. Morgan was cut off and I was just wondering if you could just perhaps give us some more information on any updates that are going on regarding that.\nSteve J. Crowe: Well, I really don\u2019t have a lot of additional information to offer up. I had commented on the status and successful progress of our steam flood in the carbonate rock, and also had mentioned that we\u2019ve been having ongoing discussions with the Kingdom for an extension of the concession agreement, which is progressing and against which we\u2019re very optimistic that we\u2019ll have a successful resolution. Beyond that, I really don\u2019t have any additional information to provide to you on the call here today.\nWasim Khalil: Right, okay. I guess then if there\u2019s no additional information, there\u2019s no additional questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from  Doug Leggate of Quandrum.\nDoug Leggate: This is becoming a bit of a theme here -- on this partition neutral zone, I\u2019m just curious; in the event that the concession is extended, can you give any kind of rough approximation as to what the period that you would expect it to be? Because I\u2019m expecting you would be able to book the reserves here, right, if it gets extended?\nSteve J. Crowe: If the concession is extended, we would be able to book reserves. As you know, under current accounting rules, we\u2019re only able to book reserves to the extent that production would occur under the existing contract. As far as any of the commercial terms that are in the midst of being finalized and negotiated, I\u2019m clearly not at liberty to discuss those now but your fundamental premise about being able to book reserves is correct, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: I guess as a related follow-up, would this be as long as the original concession, or would there be much shorter -- just, you know, ballpark would be really useful.\nSteve J. Crowe: Well, the existing concession was for 60 years and I am really not at liberty to talk about the terms of the successor, if it is concluded. We\u2019ll give the investment community full detail, or as much detail as we can at the point of our announcement.\nDoug Leggate: Great. Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions)\nSteve J. Crowe: Matt, it looks like we\u2019ve gone through the lists of analysts who had questions for us. I think in closing, let me say how much I appreciate all of the analysts participation, particularly asking questions on behalf of all of those listening, and thank you very much. Matt, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to Chevron's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Steve Crowe. Please go ahead, sir.\nSteve J. Crowe: Thanks, Matt. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Jim Aleveras, General Manager of Investor Relations is on the call with me today. Our focus is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2008. We will refer to the slides that are available on the web. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2. I\u2019ll begin with slide 3, which provides an overview of our financial performance. The company\u2019s first quarter earnings were $5.2 billion, or $2.48 per diluted share. Our first quarter 2008 earnings were up nearly 10% from the first quarter 2007, reflecting higher crude oil and natural gas prices, which more than offset weaker downstream results. The first quarter of last year included a $700 million gain on the sale of our interest in a refinery in The Netherlands. First quarter 2008 earnings rose 6% compared to the fourth quarter 2007, which Jim will discuss shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 23%. The debt ratio was about 8% at the end of the quarter. As we announced Wednesday, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.07 per share, or 12.1%. This marks the fourth consecutive year we\u2019ve raised the second quarter dividend by a double-digit amount. Stock buy-backs were $2 billion in the quarter. Jim will now take us through the quarterly comparisons. Jim.\nJim Aleveras: Thanks, Steve. My remarks compare results of the first quarter 2008 with the fourth quarter 2007. As a reminder, our earnings release compared the first quarter 2008 with the same quarter a year ago. Turning to slide 4, first quarter net income was almost $300 million higher than the fourth quarter. Starting with the left side of the chart, higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited the company\u2019s worldwide upstream results. Partly offsetting this was the impact of lower upstream volumes. The largest component here was international liftings. Liftings were lower than production in the first quarter. Downstream results were up slightly from the fourth quarter, reflecting improved refinery operations in the United States. The variance in the residual other bar is the net of everything else. Slide 5 summarizes the results of our U.S. upstream operations, which improved by about $220 million between quarters. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $335 million. Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realization was up about $8 per barrel between consecutive quarters. This is more than the $7.25 per barrel increase in WTI\u2019s spot prices, since much of our Gulf of Mexico crude oil production is priced on a lagged basis. Production volumes were down 2% between quarters, largely due to operational and weather related downtime, as well as normal fuel declines. This impact reduced earnings by $85 million. The $85 million DD&A reflects higher rates and higher accretion charges for abandonment. Exploration expense fell $90 million between periods. The primary factor was lower well write-offs in the first quarter. The other bar reflects miscellaneous gas marketing and income tax items. Let\u2019s turn to slide 6. International upstream earnings for the first quarter were about $70 million higher than the fourth quarter\u2019s results. Higher oil and gas prices increased earnings by $370 million. Our unit realization for liquids rose by $5.70 per barrel, significantly less than the $9.30 per barrel increase in brent spot prices. Comparing average prices for the first and fourth quarters, we found that worldwide benchmark crudes did not move consistently. For example, Malaysia\u2019s light sweet tapas crude was up $3.20 per barrel between quarter and Sumatra Light rose $7.70 per barrel. WTI\u2019s spot prices increased $7.25 per barrel, $2 less than the change in brent. Our realizations therefore reflected geographic market prices which were not in line with brent movements during this particular comparison period. Lower first quarter liftings, particularly in Azerbaijan, the U.K., Nigeria, and Australia, reduced earnings by $195 million. As I noted earlier, we were under-lifted in the first quarter, an issue we referenced in the interim update. Partially offsetting this under-lift is a one-time benefit from the retroactive effect of the unitization agreement in Indonesia we also mentioned in the interim update. Tax items reduced earnings by $230 million between quarters. These were spread among several countries and included the absence of favorable fourth quarter items we discussed on our last conference call. Operating expense was down $130 million from the fourth quarter due to lower seasonal activity levels in several international areas. The other bar reflects the net of many unrelated items. The largest components were adverse foreign exchange effects, offset by lower exploration expense. Slide 7 summarizes the change in worldwide oil equivalent production, including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada. Production fell by 14,000 barrels per day, or about half of 1% between consecutive quarters. United States production fell 15,000 barrels per day, about 2% due to operational down time and normal field declines. Outside the United States, overall production was flat between quarters. Kazakhstan benefited from the ramp-up of staged oil from the TCO expansion project. Offsetting this were reduced entitlements in Azerbaijan. Comparing the fourth and first quarters, the increase in international liquids realizations reduced our volumes by about 25,000 barrels per day, due to cost recovery and variable royalty provisions of certain production contracts. As we noted at our March analyst meeting in New York City, each contract is different and there are non-linear points when certain thresholds are reached. Looking at our 2008 production guidance, our general rule of thumb is unchanged. A $1 per barrel increase in crude oil prices will reduce our production entitlement by roughly 2,000 barrels per day. We caution that this is only an estimate and results will vary, especially for individual quarterly comparisons. In the context of our production, I would like to briefly summarize our upstream project status. As we discussed at our March meeting, the Tengiz expansion is on track with the first phase of staged oil meeting all of its targets and full facility start-up on schedule for the third quarter of this year. First oil at Blind Faith, our Gulf of Mexico project, forecasted for the late second quarter is now projected to occur in the second half of 2008 due to an issue with the mooring lines. The exact timing of startup is dependent on weather in the Gulf. As we mentioned at the March meeting, a fourth well was added to the initial development plan for Blind Faith. The acceleration of the fourth well reflects higher than anticipated reservoir quality. This well has now been drilled, completed, and is ready for production at the time of facility startup later this year. As indicated in March, gross peak production for Blind Faith is now expected to be 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Also in March, we said we expected first oil from Moho Bilondo offshore of the Republic of Congo in the second half of this year. This project has now started up ahead of schedule. In Nigeria, we expect our Agbami project to remain on track for a third quarter start-up. Overall, our upstream projects are moving forward. While we will provide an update later in the year, we are optimistic that when adjusted for price effects, our 2008 production will be on track with the guidance we provided in march that was based on $70 oil prices. Let\u2019s turn to slide 8 -- our U.S. downstream operations moved from a loss position in the fourth quarter to break-even results in the first quarter. Industry refining and marketing indicator margins on the west coast weakened in the first quarter. Although refining margins improved somewhat on the Gulf Coast, marketing margins declined. On balance, especially given Chevron's west coast weighting, industry margins were an adverse $55 million impact between quarters. With the completion of our El Segundo refinery upgrade project at the end of 2007, the coker was back in operation and we were able to run heavier crudes. That helped to improve first quarter results by roughly $100 million. The swing in timing effects, such as the impact of provisionally priced foreign crudes, was $50 million better in the first quarter, since crude prices did not rise as much from the beginning to the end of the first quarter as they did in the fourth quarter. Sales of motor gasoline and jet fuel were down by 2% and 3% respectively. While diesel fuel sales strengthened between quarters, lower first quarter volumes resulted in an adverse impact of $50 million. Turning to slide 9, international downstream earnings fell about $10 million from the fourth quarter\u2019s results. Refining indicator margins were lower while marketing margins were mixed across our international geographic areas. On balance, margins reduced earnings by about $30 million between quarters. Volumetric effects were a $70 million adverse variance. This reflected planned shutdowns at refineries in Canada, South Africa, Singapore, and South Korea. Additionally, marketing volumes were affected by seasonal factors in Asia and Africa. Higher charter rates resulted in a $70 million increase in international shipping earnings. The $19 million benefit in the other bar is the net of many items, including adverse tax effects and favorable OpEx variance. Slide 10 shows that earnings from chemical operations were $43 million in the first quarter compared with $69 million in the fourth quarter. Results for olefins improved on higher margins and volumes, especially for polyethylene. Aromatics were essentially unchanged as volumes and margins were mixed. Included in the other bar here is an approximately $40 million environmental provision we mentioned in the interim update, as well as the absence of favorable tax items we discussed on last quarter\u2019s conference call. Slide 11 covers all other. First quarter results were net charges of $255 million compared to net charges of $237 million in the fourth quarter. Corporate tax adjustments had a $100 million adverse impact between quarters. Corporate charges shown were a favorable variance of $85 million. This largely reflects lower advertising and employee related expense. As we mentioned in the interim update, our current guidance for all other activities is a charge of $250 million to $300 million. Because of irregularly occurring accruals and other charges that affect corporate and other activities, we continue to expect volatility in this area and the possibility that actual results will lie outside the guidance range. That completes our brief analysis of the quarter. Back over to you, Steve.\nSteve J. Crowe: Thanks, Jim. And now a brief recap of our strategic progress in recent months. Please turn to slide 12. Jim touched on the Moho Bilondo deepwater project in the Republic of the Congo. We confirmed start-up ahead of schedule of this 31% owned partner operated project. It is expected to reach maximum total crude oil production of 90,000 barrels per day in 2010. With our partners, we made the final investment decision to construct Platong Gas II natural gas project in Thailand. The $3.1 billion project will add 420 million cubic feet a day of processing capacity. Chevron is the operator and holds a 70% interest. Start-up is anticipated in 2011. We began front-end engineering and design work to develop an LNG project at our 100% owned Wheatstone discovery in Australia. We estimate that Wheatstone holds 4.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resource. In Nigeria, along with our partners, we made the final investment decision to develop the deepwater Usan Field. Chevron Nigeria Limited holds a 30% interest in this partner operated project. Usan is expected to have first production in late 2011 with peak production of 180,000 barrels of oil per day. Finally, as I mentioned, earlier in the week our board approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend. We\u2019ve raised our quarterly dividend by a double-digit amount in each of the last four years and our shareholders have benefited from 21 consecutive years of higher annual dividend payouts. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take your questions, one question and one follow-up per caller, please. Matt, please open the lines for questions. Thanks.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: A couple of things; firstly a high level question, if I could, and then secondly a more detailed one. In terms of the cash management, Steve, if you could just talk about firstly your expectations for CapEx this year, given what we\u2019ve seen so far in Q1. I guess you are still on target for your original guidance. And secondly, the sensitivity to buy-backs -- should we just keep with a ratable $2 billion? Thanks.\nSteve J. Crowe: Thanks, Paul. At this point, we confirm that our capital expenditures for 2008 are still at the budgeted amount, which is just shy of $23 billion. As far as our cash management, I think under the current conditions you can expect a buy-back pace comparable to what you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter. We\u2019ve had a $2 billion per quarter buy-back pace in the third and fourth quarters of last year and now again in the first quarter of 2008. So I think that\u2019s a reasonable expectation at this point in time. We certainly have worked into our cash management the higher dividend that was announced a couple of days ago.\nPaul Sankey: Great, and if I could on the detail question, it didn\u2019t come up on the slide but in Indonesia, you are down quite hard in oil and up in gas. Is there something going on on the oil side that we should know about? And if you could make any other observations about the dynamics of Indonesian growth, that would be great. And a cheeky follow-up -- is Bangladesh, is that peeking now in terms of its volumes or is there more growth to come? Thanks.\nSteve J. Crowe: With respect to Indonesia, one of the things that we had noted in the interim update is in the first quarter gas, as it affects OEG production, was benefited by a unitization and the retroactive benefit of that unitization. As far as liquids production in Indonesia, I am not aware of anything that is systemic, Paul, that would result in the change in terms of our longer term profile. As regards Bangladesh, that operation has been running very well and there\u2019s been increased demand on the Bangladesh operation so I don\u2019t see any change in the intermediate term here. Thanks very much for your questions. May we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Cheng with Lehman Brothers.\nPaul Cheng: Steve, in the past, you were talking about the underlying decline curve I think in your assumption that you are using 4.5% for the whole corporation. In the first quarter, is the number showing any substantial difference from that?\nSteve J. Crowe: Paul, I don\u2019t have a number for the first quarter for that short a period as to what the decline rate is for our base operations, but as George Kirkland mentioned at the analyst meeting in March, we did have a lot of success in 2007 with a decline rate much below the guidance that we are still confirming in that 4.5% to 5% range. As George mentioned, one point doesn\u2019t make a trend and while we were very pleased and optimistic as to the success in 2007, at this stage we\u2019d still advise the analyst community to use the guidance of 4.5% to 5%. Paul, did you have a follow-up question?\nPaul Cheng: Yeah, somewhat unrelated, I think Jim talked about the underlifting in the quarter. How much has the underlifting in the quarter actually cost you in terms of earnings? And at the end of the first quarter, are we from an inventory standpoint already balanced or are we still underlifted?\nJim Aleveras: We were underlifted by about 5% in the first quarter, so that\u2019s about 50,000 barrels, a little over 50,000 barrels a day.\nPaul Cheng: Jim, do you have how much it cost you?\nJim Aleveras: The impact of a 50,000 barrel a day reduction is shown in our international upstream volumes because it is lifting, not production, that affects earnings.\nPaul Cheng: Okay, so it is $195 million.\nJim Aleveras: If you look at our international upstream income, that $195 million or roughly $200 million impact is largely because liftings in the first quarter were lower than in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we were about balanced. We were about 1% underlifted.\nPaul Cheng: Okay, so we are, as of the end of the first quarter, we are underlifted so in theory, we should see an overlifting in the second quarter?\nJim Aleveras: Not necessarily in the second quarter but over time. These things are related to the timing of cargos but we don\u2019t always see them come back each quarter, but over time that is a good item. I would like to emphasize that the volume, the $195 million on slide 6 for international upstream income reflects not just the liquids underlift but also affects the favorable impact of the gas unitization agreement that we mentioned.\nSteve J. Crowe: Paul, the only other thing that I would mention to you, when you look at the quantification of the OEG barrel underlift, is that not all barrels carry with them the same degree of profitability. So there can be circumstances where you have comparable underlifts in two periods but the P&L effect would be very different because it depends on where those underlifts occur.\nPaul Cheng: Certainly. Very good. Thank you.\nSteve J. Crowe: Thanks, Paul. May we have the next question?\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Citigroup.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. First question is a follow-up to Paul -- the 50,000 barrels per day that Jim mentioned as the underlift from the international upstream, can you quantify the gas unitization benefit? What was the volumetric effect of that, is my first one.\nSteve J. Crowe: As I recall, the effect of the unitization was about 25,000 barrels a day in terms of OEG production. Again, that will get ratably smaller as you take it out through all four quarters of this year.\nDoug Leggate: Okay, great, thanks. The second one is actually a downstream question -- Jim mentioned the $100 million impact on earnings as a result of the coker being back up and now you are running heavy oil. Can you give us some idea -- that\u2019s an earnings impact; give us some idea of what the margin benefit was, or perhaps to put it another way -- what kind of volumes and what kind of [grade] of crude are you now running there and how has that changed relative to let\u2019s say before the project was completed?\nJim Aleveras: Doug, the volumes in crude we are running are not substantially different. What is different is that we are no longer running lighter sweeter crudes. We are running less expensive heavier crudes. I don\u2019t have the exact split-out of what our crude slate was, and we wouldn\u2019t disclose that, for the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter but you can see the financial impact in the bar there.\nSteve J. Crowe: And Doug, I would point out that the magnitude of that impact again is influenced by the fact that while the coker was down in the fourth quarter, we were by necessity buying lighter, sweeter, and more expensive crudes and feedstocks.\nDoug Leggate: So not all of the $100 million was margin benefit -- some was lower cost?\nJim Aleveras: It\u2019s primarily lower cost.\nDoug Leggate: Sorry, I mean operating costs as opposed to costs accrued, because you were not buying the other products in the fourth quarter.\nJim Aleveras: Well, it\u2019s primarily the cost of feedstock, which is more expensive crude. There were some intermediates purchased but it was primarily in the fourth quarter we purchased lighter, sweeter crudes.\nDoug Leggate: Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks very much.\nSteve J. Crowe: Thanks, Doug. Did you have another follow-up? Okay, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse.\nMark Flannery: I\u2019ve got two questions; the first one is can you give us an idea of what\u2019s going on same-store sales just on the west coast in terms of volumes? I know you mentioned a couple of numbers there during the call, about 2% drop in gasoline and distillate doing well. But could you just run through them again and include a number for diesel? And then I have a follow-up.\nSteve J. Crowe: Mark, I don\u2019t have a Chevron same-store sales comparing first quarter \u201908 say to first quarter of \u201907 in front of me, but I can tell you that if you look at motor gasoline demand industry wide in the United States using DOE implied demand data, through April demand is down about seven-tenths of a percent. But the interesting component from a portfolio perspective is in pad five, we\u2019re down nearly 7% whereas in pads one through four, we\u2019re up about a half a percent during that four month period. So we are seeing a greater demand impact here out on the west coast where Chevron's portfolio is proportionately larger than some of our competitors. Now on the distillate side, and covering all the distillates, U.S. demand for the first four months is down a little less than 3% compared to the comparable period a year ago.\nMark Flannery: Just specifically on your own operations, are you exporting distillate right now, either from the west coast or the Gulf?\nSteve J. Crowe: Not that I\u2019m aware of at this juncture.\nMark Flannery: Okay. Maybe I could just jam this one in as the follow-up --\nSteve J. Crowe: And in fact, we\u2019ll try to get back to you with the specifics on that if we have any different information.\nMark Flannery: Okay, I\u2019ll call Jim later but I guess the follow-up, which is not really a follow-up, is do you have any update on Gorgon maybe to give us right now?\nSteve J. Crowe: Nothing different than what George and Dave would have described to you at the March analyst meeting. We are pressing ahead with revised compliance for the environmental permit to reflect three rather than two trains on barrel island, but we are committed to the project. We are looking for ways to make it economic and take out costs, but the three partners are aligned with respect to the strategy, so it\u2019s essentially a confirmation of the information that was provided back in mid-March. Thanks very much. May we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Gillman of Benchmark. Your question, please.\nMark Gillman: Good morning. Guys, I\u2019m having trouble understanding the overseas downstream earnings. It almost looks to me, and perhaps you guys can clarify it, as if there was some kind of step-down that occurred about mid-year in \u201907, impacted both the fourth quarter and first quarter. If you were to try to reconcile first quarter against year-ago first quarter, just looking at the margin comparisons you wouldn\u2019t get anywhere near close. And I guess I am further puzzled by the comment Jim made regarding the shipping component of such earnings, which up significantly in the first quarter versus the fourth, where it would appear to me tanker rates were down sharply 4Q versus 1. Any help? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up.\nJim Aleveras: Well, let\u2019s take the first part of your question with regard to margins. The margins that we are quoting are very specific to Chevron's marketing areas internationally, so Mark, as you are familiar with, we are marketing in certain areas and we use the indicator margins to try to match where we are located. And margins have been a little weaker but have been mixed overall. You\u2019ll recall that last year in this quarter, we had the benefit of the sale of our interest in a refinery in The Netherlands --\nMark Gillman: I took that out, Jim. That\u2019s not a factor.\nJim Aleveras: -- and later in the year, we had the benefit of the sale of our refining and marketing assets in the Benelux countries. But if you remove those, yes, margins have been a little bit weaker and volumes have been a little weaker in the second half of the year than they were in the first half. But as to your comment about shipping, we\u2019re just looking at the freight rates that are charged for the particular routes and the particular vessels that we use. And of course, shipping charges are an expense to the rest of the downstream. We broke it out here partly because we wanted to show from a transparency standpoint what the components were.\nMark Gillman: Okay, let me try my follow-up, if I could please; the comment in the U.S. upstream regarding DD&A, I did some rough math, probably not very good at this point in the week but nonetheless, I\u2019m coming up with about 2 to 2.50 an equivalent barrel increase in the DD&A rate in order to justify that variance. Given the absence of any negative year-end \u201907 U.S. reserve data, I don\u2019t quite understand what it is with virtually no change in producing projects, if you will, could generate a DD&A increase of that magnitude and I\u2019m interested in whether it is sustainable going forward.\nSteve J. Crowe: Mark, that\u2019s a good question. One of the things that we did in the latter part of 2007 was a full review of the abandonment provision for all of our operations, the so-called ARO liability. And we accrued at year-end 2007 an additional abandonment provision that through the workings of the ARO get accreted as part of the DD&A charge as production occurs through those fields that are so affected. So there would be some discontinuity as you look at fourth quarter on into the first quarter of this year as a result of that, and I suspect, Mark, that\u2019s the missing piece that you can\u2019t find.\nMark Gillman: Is that sustainable, Steve?\nSteve J. Crowe: Well, it\u2019s sustainable to the extent that we\u2019ve increased the abandonment provision for those fields and that higher charge will be taken through DD&A over the life of the fields, and that abandonment provision will be higher then in 2008 than it would have been in earlier periods.\nMark Gillman: Okay. Thanks very much.\nSteve J. Crowe: You\u2019re welcome, Mark. May we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Mielke of Merrill Lynch.\nErik Mielke: Good morning, gentlemen. I have a couple of questions on the upstream production. Firstly on Asian gas, which was stronger for Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Thailand than what we\u2019d model. I know you already touched on this but I just want to make sure we understand what we should expect for the remainder of 2008, whether the first quarter production level is a good guide for those three specific countries on natural gas.\nSteve J. Crowe: I don\u2019t have any information to suggest they aren\u2019t other than the item that I alluded to with respect to the unitization of our gas field in Indonesia. That obviously would have a -- because of the retroactivity would have a greater affect in the first quarter than the other three quarters of the year. Jim, do you have anything else to add to that?\nJim Aleveras: No, I don\u2019t.\nSteve J. Crowe: Erik, do you have a follow-up?\nErik Mielke: I do. I have two follow-ups, if I\u2019m able. Let me try one first -- first in Kazakhstan, you mentioned that Tengiz  will be the next step change for Tengiz is in the third quarter. Should we expect a further increase in the second quarter? Is there an element of ramp-up taking place there? And is there any maintenance at Karachaganak that we need to be aware of?\nJim Aleveras: Well, let\u2019s take Kazakhstan -- we\u2019re seeing about a 90,000 barrel a day improvement in production as a result of the first phase, the sour gas injection. That was ramping up in the first quarter and is now fully ramped up, you see 34, which is half of a 70 mbd increase reflecting our 50% share. That increase ought to be a little higher in the second quarter but you won\u2019t see a substantial change until we get into the third quarter and we have full production facilities. Erik, you asked about another location?\nSteve J. Crowe: Karachaganak.\nJim Aleveras: Oh, Karachaganak.\nErik Mielke: Whether there is maintenance in Karachaganak.\nJim Aleveras: I don\u2019t have anything on that of substance that I am looking at here. If there was, it was not something that was terribly dramatic.\nSteve J. Crowe: Erik, did you have one more question?\nErik Mielke: If I can try a cheeky one, just on Nigeria with the outages that other operators have had there, have you had any impact on your second quarter volumes that we need to be aware of?\nSteve J. Crowe: No, in talking to our operational folks in Nigeria, the impacts that some of the others have faced in the first quarter and here in the early second quarter, we haven\u2019t experienced to the same degree. We\u2019ve had very, very nominal shut-ins for very short durations in our operations. I would also point out, Erik, too as Jim and I have mentioned, we\u2019ve got a Agbami coming on here in the third quarter and Agbami, unlike some of the other operations that are on-shore, is a deepwater project and it is 70 miles offshore, so it is quite a ways away from where some of the unrest has occurred. So we expect that the Agbami project will come on as advertised in the third quarter. Thanks very much, Erik, for your questions.\nErik Mielke: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Neil McMahon of Sanford Bernstein.\nNeil McMahon: Just a quick question on the exploration wells that are sort of the high profile ones that are getting drilled -- any update on the Jack and Saint Malo appraisal wells? And also, could you give us some sort of guidance as to when the drilling of the Orphan Basin well is going to take place?\nSteve J. Crowe: With respect to the Orphan Basin, I recall that the next well would be drilled in 2009 and as far as the follow-up wells for Jack and Saint Malo, they are -- one is underway now, as I recall, and another a little bit later in the year. And then decisions will be made following those evaluations as to whether or not Jack and Saint Malo will be kept as separate projects or conceivably combined.\nNeil McMahon: Okay, maybe as a loose follow-up in the upstream, just in terms of the whole Caspian Basin and the CPC pipeline, how much are you guys involved in looking at a bosphoros bypass pipeline in Turkey as a way of making sure that the increase Tengiz volumes, especially as we go forward over time, can find a decent route to market?\nJim Aleveras: Neil, all I can say is that we are looking at all of our options because obviously optionality is very important to us in terms of expansion of our existing pipeline. But right now we have rail capacity to handle all of the exports in addition to the pipeline capacity that would result from an expansion of the Tengiz project. But in terms of what specifics we are looking at over and above rail, we\u2019d rather not discuss that.\nSteve J. Crowe: I would say that the discussions with the partners to expand the capacity of CPC is as it has been is ongoing and there are various conditions that each party has tabled that we are looking at but we will still continue with the negotiations for the expansion of CPC. As Jim said, we otherwise have mechanisms to move Tengiz crude and just as we had done before the CPC pipeline was completed, we are using rail and other means to move the crude. Thanks very much for your question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jerry Gunn of BlackRock.\nSteve J. Crowe: Hello, Jerry?\nOperator: Jerry, did you have a question? You may want to check your mute button.\nSteve J. Crowe: Okay, let\u2019s try the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Mark Gillman of Benchmark.\nMark Gillman: Steve and Jim, are there any rate of return or cumulative production thresholds on block 14 that would be encountered -- block 14 in Angola -- that would be encountered this year at current price levels?\nSteve J. Crowe: Not that I\u2019m aware of. Hang on one sec here, I\u2019ll see if I can see anything. In terms of price levels, looking at objective -- no, there is nothing substantive that is associated with the African operations.\nMark Gillman: Okay, if I could just sneak a follow-up; Steve, I wasn\u2019t clear what you meant by that roughly 25,000 a day characterization of the impact of the Indonesian unitization on the gas side. I thought that there was a one-time retroactive element which is benefiting the first quarter and then a considerably smaller positive impact going forward. What was the 25 equivalents a day supposed to represent?\nSteve J. Crowe: That was the retroactivity piece that I was alluding to that would be non-recurring obviously in other quarters. So your understanding is correct, Mark.\nMark Gillman: Okay, fine. Thank you.\nJim Aleveras: Matt, do we have other callers?\nOperator: At this time, I am showing no further questions.\nSteve J. Crowe: Thank you. I am presuming that we\u2019ve been able to cover your questions in the time allotted and I think in large measure because our interim update provided a lot of information that\u2019s proved to be consistent with the earnings release that you saw today. So in closing, I want to express my appreciation to everyone\u2019s participation on the call and I especially want to thank each of the analysts on behalf of the participants for their questions during this morning\u2019s session. Matt, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s 2008 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day."}], "2010": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2009, "date": "2010-01-30 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning, my name is Sean and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) I\u2019d now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.\nJohn Watson: Thanks Sean, welcome to Chevron\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. It is good to be back on the calls. With me today are Pat Yarrington, our CFO, and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron\u2019s financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2009. We will refer to the slides that are available on our website. Before we gets started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements, we ask that you review the cautionary statements on slide two. Turning to slide three, I\u2019d like to provide a brief summary of our operational performance in 2009. We had a number of very significant accomplishments during the year. We again set a new record for safety, and are among the best in the industry. We continue to operate with excellence and increase both production efficiency and refinery reliability. We grew production by 7% in 2009, reflecting the startup and ramp-up of major capital projects, and strong performance in our base business. Project execution was of course key to these results. Projects that started up between 2007 and 2009 contributed over 450,000 barrels a day of net production in 2009. Our continued focus on cost management delivered very positive results lowering our operating expenses by 15% compared with 2008. Finally, in the face of global economic downturn we maintained our strategic focus on the key drivers that will ensure growth and superior returns to our stockholders in the years ahead. This consistency, in my view, in our strategy, is one of our great strengths. The slide 4 summarizes our strategic accomplishments for 2009. In the upstream we had another year of successful exploration with key discoveries in Australia, United States and Africa. On a preliminary basis, we estimate that we replaced a 112% of our production through net reserve additions in 2009. Absent price effects, the 2009 reserve replacement ratio was a 145%. We started off three major Chevron operated deep water projects, Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico, Frade in Brazil, and Tombua and Landana in Angola. There were also production gains from major capital projects started in 2008 that ramped up to nameplate capacity in 2009. The Tengiz expansion in Kazakhstan, Agbami in Nigeria and Blind Faith in the Gulf of Mexico, all were significant contributors to our 2009 production growth and will generate value for years to come. Continuing our progress in the deep water Gulf of Mexico, we entered front-end engineering and design work on our Jack/St. Malo in Big Foot developments. We also made significant strides in advancing our gas business. In Australia, we reached a final investment position for Gorgon in September, a true legacy project for the company and the largest in our history. We have also signed long-term sales and purchase agreements and heads of agreement for about 90% of our Gorgon equity LNG off-take. Also, in Australia, we had a exceed Wheatstone natural gas project in July. Since that time we are welcomed equity partners in to the project, brining additional gas supplies and establishing Wheatstone as an LNG hub. We have also entered into heads of agreement with buyers to deliver almost 60% of the total LNG off-take from the first two trains. In Africa, construction continued at our Escravos gas-to-liquid project in Nigeria, in Angola LNG project. Both facilities are expected to start up in 2012. In China, we received government approvals for the first stage of Chongdong Bay [ph] is our gas project. In the Vietnam we signed heads of agreement that will allow us to begin foreign engineering and design works for this offshore natural gas development in the Gulf of Thailand. Looking at our downstream business refineries ran at strong levels of reliability for the second consecutive year. We have cut unplanned unit outages in half over the same time period. Finally, portfolio rationalization continued and we successfully completed 13 market exists in 2009. We received good value for these assets. The exists contribute to lower in costs and capital employed in the downstream and the line with our strategy to focus on markets of competitive strength. Slide 5, provides a brief overview of our financial performance. The company\u2019s first quarter earnings were $3.1 billion, or $1.53 per diluted share. Comparing the fourth quarter 2009 to the same period a year earlier, our earnings were down 37%. The upstream business benefited from higher crude oil prices and increase net oil-equivalent production, while our downstream results fell, reflecting weaker product margins. Return on capital employed for the year was 10.6%, the debt ratio at the end of the year was 10.3%, and net debt was below $2 billion underscoring Chevron\u2019s financial strength and flexibility. Dividends were $5.3 billion for the year, and 2009 marked our 22nd consecutive annual dividend increase with an annual average growth rate over that period of 7%. Finally, Chevron\u2019s 2009 TSR of 8.1% was the highest of the U.S. majors. When taking a longer view, Chevron has held a number one ranking in the peer group for both the three year and five year averages and outpaced the S&P 500 return by more than 10% in both comparative periods. Pat will now take us through the quarterly comparisons, Pat?\nPat Yarrington: Thanks John. My remarks compare the results of fourth quarter 2009 with the third quarter of 2009. And as a reminder, our earnings release compares fourth quarter \u201909 with the same quarter a year-ago. Turning now to slide six, fourth quarter earnings were down $760 million from the third quarter. Starting from the left side of the chart, higher crude oil and natural gas realization as well as increased production volumes benefited the company\u2019s worldwide upstream results. Downstream earnings were shortly lower on core refining and marketing margin, and resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter. The variance in the other bar reflects higher corporate charges and lower chemicals earnings. On slide seven, our U.S. upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were about 170 million higher than the third quarters result. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $295 million. Chevron\u2019s average US crude oil realization was up $7 a barrel between consecutive quarters, about a $1 less than the increase in average spot price of WTI. Natural gas realizations also increased between quarters in line with Henry Hub spot prices and represented about $75 million of the positive variance. The absence of a settlement gain of certain hurricane insurance claims recognized in the third quarter resulted in $110 million negative variance between periods. The other bar here is comprised of a number of offsetting items. Turning to slide eight. International upstream earnings were up about $200 million compared with the third quarter. Higher oil and gas realizations increased earnings by $435 million. Average realizations for liquids rose to 11% in line with the increase in Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations were also higher in the fourth quarter contributing about $60 million to earnings. Higher lifting, primarily in Kazakhstan and Australia benefited earnings by $100 million. Recall that the third quarter included a net benefit of about $400 million triggered by the formal approval of the Gorgon project. The absence of this benefit was partly offset by gains on certain small equity sales resulting in a net $300 million variance this period. The other bar includes several items and netted to a charge of $38 million for the quarter. The largest components here were operating expense and tax items which mostly offset. Slide nine summarizes a quarterly change in worldwide oil equivalent production, including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada. Production increased to 76,000 barrel a day or nearly 3% between quarters. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contract by an estimated 12,000 barrel a day. The external constraints bar shows a benefit of 44,000 barrel a day, largely reflecting a return to normal operations in Nigeria for the full fourth quarter. Base business production declined roughly 29,000 barrel a day primarily due to storm related shut-in in the Gulf of Mexico and China as well as normal sale decline. And as shown on the green bar increased production for major capital projects benefited fourth quarter production by 73,000 barrel a day, largely driver by higher volumes at TCO and a favorable adjustment related to a deepwater Gulf of Mexico royalty settlement. Slide 10, compares full year 2009 OEG production to that of 2008. Production rose 7% or 174,000 barrels a day. Price impacts from production sharing and variable royalty contract, increased production by an estimated 55,000 barrel a day. WTI prices as you know average $62 a barrel in 2009 versus $100 a barrel in 2008. For the year, external constraints including securities disruption in Nigeria, OPEC related curtailment early in the year and lower natural gas demand in Asia essentially offset the volume metric impact of lower prices. Based business production declined by 130,000 barrels a day. Strong based business performance limited our decline rates slightly more than 5% ahead of the 6% or 7% guidance we provided earlier. And finally, major capital projects contributed an incremental 305,000 barrels a day to 2009 oil and gas production, reflecting a ramp-up of key 2008 projects and new project startups in 2009. On slide 11, you see our full year outlook for production in 2010 is 2.73 million barrels a day, 1% increase over 2009 levels. The outlook does assume a $62 per barrel price range, the same average price as in 2009, and it does not assume OPEC curtailment, material security or market-related impacts. Recognizing the reduced base business investments in 2009, we project base business declines to average approximately 6% or 164,000 barrels a day. While we had increased our planned 2010 base business investments, there is a lag between the timing of investment and the associated production benefit. In 2010 we will continue to limit North America natural gas development activities due to current market conditions. The growth for major capital projects is projected to be 190,000 barrels a day. Now keep in mind that the smaller percentage growth in 2010 is also a result of accelerated ramp-ups that led to higher than expected production growth in 2009. In other words growth has been achieved earlier than planned, which is a good thing. Turning to slide 12, U.S. downstream earnings fell about $380 million in the fourth quarter, indicator margins were down sharply resulting in a 170 million negative variance. Refining margins declined especially on the West Coast due to seasonal decline in gasoline demand, high product inventory levels, and riding crude prices. Lower volumes in the fourth quarter largely reflected plant maintenance at our El Segundo refinery in California and lowered earnings by $40 million. Operating expenses were $65 million higher between periods, largely due to the El Segundo plant shutdown and a non-recurring charge related to a previously announced exit of certain US East Coast markets. Multiple components made up the other bar including lower trading results and unfavorable tax variances. On slide 13, international downstream earnings decreased about a $430 million from the third quarter\u2019s result. Lower realized margins reduced earnings by a $175 million between quarters. This was particularly evident in the Asia Pacific region or Singapore cracking margins fell by almost 50%. Timing effects resulted in a $260 million negative variance between periods in part reflecting higher price volatility in the quarter. The timing affect bar includes inventory and mark-to-market effects as well as impacts of flagged [ph] aviation contract pricing. The other bar was a small benefit for the quarter. Slide 14, shows that earnings from chemical operations were about $65 million lower in the fourth quarter. Results for the Oliphant\u2019s aromatics and Oronite additives, all reflected lower margins. Now please note that starting in 2010, our chemicals business will be reporting to Mike Wirth and we will combine the chemical and downstream segments beginning with our first quarter results. Slide 15 covers all other. Fourth quarter net charges were $418 million, compare to a net $167 million charge in the third quarter. The $250 million increase between quarters is primarily due to unfavorable variances in tax items and other corporate charges. The all other charges in the fourth quarter were above our typical guidance range of $250 million to $350 million per quarter. So I would note that the full year results were below guidance. On slide 16, I now like to summarize our cost management efforts. I'll start first with the cost efforts. In the second quarter, we announced our goals to reduce 2009 operating and SG&A costs by 10% or $2.5 billion. This target excluded the benefit associated with lower cost to purchase fuel. We were able to exceed that target and deliver the 15% reduction totaling almost $4 billion. All business segments contributed to the reduction and the savings were delivered in a year that saw our upstream oil and gas production grow by the 7%. About one-third of the reductions were market related such as lower transportation expenses. Another third were discrete items primarily due to the absence of significant Hurricane charges realized in 2008. And the final third was the result of delivered actions taken across the company which lowered expenses in most cost categories and included portfolio actions, effort to increase efficiency and reliability to curtail or eliminate discretionary spending and to renegotiate contracts terms with suppliers. We were very diligent on every element of our cost structure this year and we are pleased with this progress in 2009 and expect to see further positive results from our efforts. And on slide 17, capital. Spending for 2009 was $22.2 billion compared with our budget of $22.8 billion. Upstream spending accounted for $17.1 billion or 77% of the total. Our cash C&E, which excludes our equity share of affiliate outlays was $20.6 billion. Our announced capital program for 2010 is $21.6 billion, a 3% decrease compared to 2009 actual expenditures. Excluding one-time concession payments in 2009, our 2010 budget represents an increase of approximately 15% in upstream spending. Of the overall 2010 capital program 80% is for upstream activities, primarily related to the large multi-year projects consistent with our upstream growth strategies. These include projects in Western Australia, the Deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Africa and the Gulf of Thailand. Another 16% is earmarked for downstream investments, a reduction of 23% from 2009 levels. The majority of the 2010 planned downstream investment is related to major projects under construction. John will now provide some thoughts on 2010, John?\nJohn Watson: Thanks Pat. Please turn to slide 18, if you would. As we enter 2010, in the downstream we continue to see challenged economic conditions. We\u2019re certainly not satisfied with our downstream results in 2009, we are shifting to a simpler and less costly organization to improve returns and remain competitive in this difficult environment. We intend to cover our efforts in much more detail in March at our regularly schedule meeting. In the upstream, we are on track to startup on three major capital projects; the Perdido Regional Hub in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the first expansion of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Canada, and the Escravos Gas project Phase 3A in Nigeria. In addition, we expect to sanction four other major capital projects. Papa-Terra in Brazil which was announced earlier this week as well Tahiti Stage 2, Jack/St. Malo in Big Foot in the Gulf of Mexico. We have had consistent strategies over time and they have served us well. They are the right strategies and will keep us competitive now and into the future. Underlying our efforts would be a continued focus on execution, investing in the right opportunities, completing our projects on time and on budget, ensuring safe and reliable operations, effectively applying technology and maintaining vigilance on our cost structure. In summary, rewarding our stockholders, continuing our disciplined growth and maintaining our financial strength are objectives we will continue to pursue in 2010 and beyond. I look forward to further discussing our future plans and our security analyst meeting on March 9th in New York City.\nOperator: (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Robert Kessler with Simmons & Company.\nRobert Kessler: Good morning, everyone. A couple of analytic questions for me, the first is, I wondered if you could give some more color around your reserve replacement for 2009. It sounds like a good figure all in; I am wondering how much specifically might have come from oil sands, mining, bookings or reclassification. So I seem recall you being at zero on the sort of footnoted reserves for mining as of 2008. So wondering did you add back $400 million barrels there and reclassify them? And then also on Gorgon, and related to that on this downstream restructuring that you're moving through, I'm wondering if the report on California, can I got over risky and suggesting that Richmond was going to close in an absolute sense. Is that let you do so and what if any refinery closures or divestments might you be contemplating?\nJohn Watson: Sure, Robert. Thanks. On reserves your memory is good. We didn\u2019t have reserves booked for the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in 2008 and so we did have an initial booking there. That\u2019s some $460 million barrels. And the Gorgon booking is a little bit over $700 million barrels. You would expect as we went FID that of course that we would bring in barrels for that. So our overall booking with other additions and price revisions was 112%. I'll emphasize that this was one, it's pulmonary and so it's still being finalized. But I would also mention that without the price revisions we would have been at about 145%. So, we think it was a good year. With respect to your second question on the downstream and perspective closures of refineries it's quite premature to talk about closing refineries. I said earlier, that we are certainly disappointed with the results in the downstream. Industry conditions are very tough right now, and we lost money in both the US and in international downstream business, which I expect as a pattern for the industry. So those results were weak. So we are on a path to improve those results. Now, we're building on a position of some strength and the reliability end of our business at the refineries and based on the competitive refinery stacks that we look at, our refineries are quite competitive but they need to stay that way, and these conditions are very difficult. So we are taking a look at all our downstream operations, and I expect you\u2019ll see some changes in organization going forward. You\u2019ll see some changes in cost and an emphasis on maintaining some of the operational momentum but doing at lower cost. Most of our divestitures up to now have focused primarily on the marketing side of the business, you\u2019ve seen us continue to rationalize markets that are distant from our key supply points. But I wouldn\u2019t want to advertise any particular refinery closures that we\u2019re contemplating at this time.\nRobert Kessler: Okay thanks for the cover, John.\nJohn Watson: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI.\nJohn Watson: Hi Doug.\nDoug Terreson: John, I want to ask another question on refining too, and this is more of a strategic bigger picture question I think, and it really involves how you envision placement of your global refining business, Chevron\u2019s global refining business in the overall mix, meaning, pre-tax you quote [ph] even earlier, you guys were historically much heavier on the upstream and the downstream on an absolute basis, and relative to the peers than, and it makes the shifted further drill [ph] on the past decade as you know. And so, the question becomes, will this shift, is it likely to continue towards the upstream as it has in the past and if the thinking here is profound of considering recharacterization of entire regions maybe to less stage of category or is it too early to know yet?\nJohn Watson: Well, Doug, I think your observations are right about how we view the business historically. If I reflect back a decade or more we have had a view that the upstream business overtime provides better returns. Now part of that is philosophical on \u2013 the upstream business has a decline curve.\nDoug Terreson: Yeah.\nJohn Watson: And there is always a need to replace volumes behind it, and so, market conditions tend to correct themselves quickly. In the downstream, of course, particularly the refining business, you need demand growth and where you don\u2019t have demand growth or you see overbuilding, it takes more time to rationalize that and we are in one of those periods right now when the conditions are difficult on the refining side. With that overall view and reflecting on the particular individual strengths that we have in our company, we have favored upstream investments for more than the last decade and that has been a pattern that I think you will see continuing going forward as we preferentially invest in the upstream will become more weighted to that business. What I would tell you, though, about the downstream are several points. One, over the course of cycle we think the downstream can earn good returns, certainly in excess of 10%, and we expect to be in excess of 10% over the course of the cycle. The second and probably more subtle aspect of the downstream business is the value that integration of that business brings to us. If you look at plants like GTL plant in Nigeria, upgraders in Hamaca, even the Tengiz in Kazakhstan, those plants wouldn\u2019t operate without a lot of downstream expertise because as you know they look a whole lot like refineries. And so, when we have that expertise, we also have the expertise that our trading and supply people bring as increasingly we are producing disadvantaged crudes or crudes that need a market and facilities that can get full value out of the raw material. And so, for a number of reasons, maybe a long answer here, a number of reasons, I think will be in the downstream business going forward, but we are going to be very measured about where that footprint is.\nDoug Terreson: Okay. Thanks for the elaboration and I think I got the message.\nJohn Watson: Okay, good. Thank you.\nDoug Terreson: You are welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you, good morning, John. It's good to hear back in the call. I am afraid I'm slow [ph] this source a little bit more. I actually have two questions if I can squeeze them in. First of all, generally on the downstream, I think you've been pretty clear about where you are going with this, but obviously you've got a number of trends, I know you don\u2019t want to be too specific, but you have a number of fairly small plans in minority interest and so on. It's hard to imagine that those are being in the big strategic benefice you just described so. Could you kind of generally characterize where you see the focus on the restructuring efforts are moving? And my second question is I kind of hate to bring this up, but your competitor obviously has, your large competitor here in the US just made fairly big bet in US gas. Obviously you've just taken our the helm here and I'm just kind of wondering where your head is in terms of longer-term, investments US gas market on the whole and if you were to offer any comments on how you see Chevron as whole [ph] in future consolidation, I would appreciate that as well? Thank you.\nJohn Watson: Sure. Those are both of your questions. First with respect to some of the joint venture refineries that we have, the way our business is structured our refineries outside the United States are largely -- are predominantly held through joint ventures. So whether it's GS Caltex or refinery in Thailand or refinery in Singapore, those are held through joint ventures as well as our interest in Caltex, Australia. So our focus is really on keeping the facilities comparative. In the United States of course and our small plant in Canada those are 100% owned refineries. So the structure of the ownership isn\u2019t necessarily the issue, it's whether the facility can be competitive. And we think our major facilities are competitive, and they have been very reliable, which as you know has been our focus over time. I think the key is making sure that we get that reliability at the right cost. And so we\u2019ll be looking to be sure that we can maintain the reliability but do it at a lower cost. Our refineries are competitive on the net cash margin, but we think that we can improve them \u2013 improve them further. And a lot of the effort that we are focusing on is continued work in the marketing area and our interface at the customer level, and through the delivery chain from the refinery to the ultimate customer. Mike Wirth will talk a lot more about this at our meeting in March as we do have plans and work underway that we think on a standalone basis we\u2019ll improve our results regardless of what happens to margins. As far as the U.S. gas business goes certainly I\u2019m aware that the big acquisition that our major competitor made in the U.S., and I would start by telling you that we do have a position in the shales, and tide [ph] gases, we have a presence in the Piceance, we have a nice presence in the Haynesville, we picked up acreage recently in Canada, and nearly a million acres in Poland. So we do have a presence in the shales. But frankly we've been in a position where we have a very strong portfolio worldwide, and we can see growth out through the rest of this decade. And so we haven\u2019t been particularly needy, if you will, to do a large transaction. And so we haven\u2019t felt that the opportunities that are out there compete with other things that we have in our portfolio. Now you know me and you know us pretty well, and we have \u2013 we are always screening the opportunities in the upstream business, it\u2019s a resource business, and we are in the business of acquiring leases, individual assets and companies, and have demonstrated that we are willing to do so when the conditions are right. We just haven\u2019t felt that they are right in the shales or otherwise in the very recent past.\nDoug Leggate: John, thanks. It\u2019s a very full answer. Thank you.\nJohn Watson: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Hi, John welcome back?\nJohn Watson: Thanks, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: This maybe a little bit of the first I have two questions. One, I am just not sure on this, if I look at the industry I think there is debate [ph] among the investors talking about the big guys like you Exxon or BP or other companies, is this possible on a sustainable basis that to grow their resource and the production base organically? I don\u2019t know whether you will be able to comment that whether you actually think the resource is not a issue that you do have the capability or that the opportunity you can see in the industry for you guys, and not just you guys but for the industry to grow or that acquisition are unavoidable -- for the industry not necessarily for Chevron, but for the industry to become a bigger piece of the pie. And secondly that, if we look at your production guidance in 2010 always that there is risk and opportunity, I am wondering that, John, if you will be able to maybe that help us understand what is the major area of the potential upside and the potential downside risk? Thank you.\nJohn Watson: Thanks, Paul. I think I am going to answer yes to both parts of your first question, at least for Chevron. Ultimately, every has to continue to add resources to the queue going forward, and so overtime every company has to add either exploration acreage companies or otherwise, and so, I think longer term we always have to be looking for new opportunities. I think when you look a little bit shorter term we can look out for the better part of this decade and see growth in our portfolio. And so we feel very good about the ques [ph] that we have and we'll give you little more information about that as George gives his run through in March on some of the specifics of our projects but we have a good queue [ph] going out over the course this decade. I think the upside in the near term and the opportunity over time is how rapid and quickly we can develop and advance new technologies so that we can increase recoveries. For example, if you look in the San Joaquin Valley, initial recoveries there were 10% or 20% of oil in place. Now at Kern River and other fields we're nearing 70%. No one would have thought that and of course we are leader in steam technology. The ability to add to the portfolio going forward is going to be a function of having an offering that host government value. And I think our technology in Seismic Imaging, reservoir Management; Deepwater Developments are highly valued including sulfur handling. And I think we have excellent relationships in those with those host governments going forward. That\u2019s helped us recently in China and the PNG. So I think, my answer to your questions we have some length in our portfolio with the assets that we have but we are going to need to capture new opportunities either through new acreage or through the acquisition side over time.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. And how about 2010, that\u2019s in guidance. The major area of potential upside or major area of potential risk we need to see for the downside or we need to monitor for the downside?\nJohn Watson: One of the challenging areas of us to forecast is in the base business area. For example, last year initially George gave guidance of about 7% decline and we over achieved last year. We only had a 5% decline this year because we consciously cut back some of our spending in base business in 2009, we\u2019ve sort of up that and put some decline in the numbers that we've given you to about 6%. And so depending upon how rapid the declines are or not in that base business, that number could be a little bit different. There is also a question of timing of some of the major capital projects that we\u2019ve got, we don\u2019t have a large number coming on right now, we've got Perdido and the Athabasca Oil Sands Project but certainly the timing of major capital project ramp-ups are there. And then, of course, you always have the issue of price effects, security and market conditions for demand for gas in Asia and other markets. So those would be the principal areas that I would highlight as both on the up and down side.\nPaul Cheng: That\u2019s great. John, can I just squeeze in one quick one for Pat? In terms of cost reduction, Pat, for the next two years what is the potential target that you guys may have and from what major area? Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Yeah Paul. We don\u2019t have the same target that we are going to handout at this particular point in time. But we do feel good about where we have closed out \u201909, and if you look forward and think about what\u2019s likely to be sustained or not, I\u2019ll take you through each of those. Number one from a self-help standpoint, we said about a third of the reduction that we\u2019ve had this year was self-help. Going forward we still are aggressively looking for additional sustained ways to continue to get our cost structure down. In the downstream sector, as you can tell that\u2019s an absolute must have to get our downstream cost structure to an affordable level. So highly focused there, we've shown you charts in the past too on upstream, how competitive the overall upstream cost structure is, we want to retain that competitive ranking. So cost is really important part of our drivers going forward. Secondly, on the market related activities, I would say that there is still a tremendous amount of evidence out there where there is surplus capacity in some of those costs categories that we would suggest that cots increases are not likely, and I will just take you through the transportation sectors, for example. There is awful lot of surplus capacity out there, and even though you have a higher energy base, we are not seeing a lot of those costs being driven through the higher transportation costs for us. And then finally, we talked last year about the contract renegotiations that we had done through the early part of the year. Many of those new contract terms only came into place part way through 2009 and they carry on into 2010, and some of them even have longer terms than that. So, we are very positive about being able to sustain and an even improve on our cost structure going forward.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you, very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.\nArjun Murti: Thank you. John, just a couple of upstream questions. I wondered if your small competitors has had some interesting success in California, a variety of different exploration place. You are obviously a large California producer, just wondering if you see kind of upside to California beyond this sort of EOR enhancements stuff you have been doing? Are there new concepts you are considering on your logic which position and then unrelatedly there has been some talking about Kazakhstan looking at tax terms and contract terms, so I am wondering if you could either confirm or deny that they are looking to potentially change their tax terms for your Tengiz contract? Thank you.\nJohn Watson: Arjun, that\u2019s a interesting concept talking about what\u2019s going on in Southern California; it doesn\u2019t get a great deal of attention, I assume you\u2019re talking about some of the work that going on around Elk Hills and we are a participant there. We do have about a 20% interest. So we are there. In general, the declines that we've seen in that business, obviously it's a mature business but the declines we\u2019ve seen been limited and they have been limited because we've been pretty clever in how we apply steam that\u2019s one of the things that we do very well and we do it at low cost. But we also have diatomite and other holdings down there that have some promise for the future. So, California is a nice area for us, in the upstream we of course have environmental constraints that we work through, but it's an encouraging business for us and maybe we'll get George to give you a little bit further update when we get to March. In term of Kazakhstan, there is a general environment out there where host governments are making sure that they feel they are getting full value out of the contracts and resources that they hold. I would tell that our relationship in Kazakhstan has always been excellent, and we have a very strong contract there and have done a good job living up to that contract. In my recent visit and discussions with the President Nazarbayev, he was very pleased with the performance of Chevron and the 10 gees in particular, and then said that to me directly. So I feel good about our relationship and confident we can work through whatever issues may surface there and in virtually every other area where we operate.\nArjun Murti: That\u2019s great. If I can ask, a quick follow-up on the balance sheet, you all will run essentially net debt free balance sheet, I think '04 it's been five or six years obviously has served you all well during the challenging economic time. Now that you\u2019re CEO John, any change for running such a pristine balance sheet. I'm sure you want to maintain balance sheet strength but is net debt free the right number for you or some different number better or worse. Thank you.\nJohn Watson: Well, Arjun, within a range we\u2019re going to keep some capacity on our balance sheet, and frankly we are heading into a period where we have \u2013 we are making some big bets on some of our major capital projects, with Gorgon and Wheatstone, and we want to be sure, of course, that we can continue to obviously pay our dividend and increase it as the pattern of earnings in cash will permit, and continue to fund these key projects as we go forward. Just like this last year when we saw prices dip, we want to be able to keep the momentum in our business and not have to stop and start operations rapidly. So I think you\u2019ll continue to see us keep some capacity on our balance sheet, though I won\u2019t tell you that \u2013 a specific number other than we do want to maintain our double AA credit ratings that we have out there. So I wouldn\u2019t look for any change in terms of how we manage our balance sheet.\nArjun Murti: That\u2019s great thank you very much.\nJohn Watson: Sure, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Gilman with Benchmark.\nMark Gilman: Folks good morning, I had a kind of couple of specific things and then one more general one. Is it accurate, the report that you have opted not to exercise your preemption rights regarding the Jack Field and Jack [ph] interest in Devon\u2019s sale to Maersk. Secondly, I was hoping that you might be able to regarding Kazakhstan. John, give us an idea, given some of the uncertainties which were referenced in the prior question. Will you proceed with the expansion project that you\u2019ve been evaluating in the environment as it stands currently? The more general question relates to L&G contracting. You folks have obviously been very active out there in the market, and I was wondering if at least qualitatively you could talk about what kinds of changes in contracts you are seeing as it relates to either to duration, structure or price formulas.\nJohn Watson: Sure, Mark. Those are all good questions. On the first one, we have exercised our pre-emptive drive around St. Malo and not for Jack. And those that\u2019s primarily around aligning our equity interest in those two opportunities, I won\u2019t say a lot more about the commercial aspects of those, but the answer to your question is basically, yes on St. Malo, no on Jack. In terms of Tengiz expansion, we are optimistic that we will be able to move forward with that project, but we have -- and we have, for example, launching some design concept et cetera. We do have more work to do on the commercial side and on the transportation side and that work is under way. But I would tell you I am optimistic and see no reason that we won\u2019t move ahead with that project but we are not at FID today, so we have to work through the remaining issues. In terms of the LNG market, we are very pleased with what we have been able to accomplish at both Gorgon and Wheatstone, and we highlighted that in our press release. In terms of the specific characteristic, the way I would describe, it\u2019s obviously competitive information, but I would say number one, we are producing gases at prices that look a lot like oil. We\u2019ve got high slopes on these contracts and we\u2019ve got good terms with some of the best buyers in the world. The history with our Japanese and Korean partners has been excellent over time in our relationships on the Northwest Shale and we think that these are among the strongest and best and sophisticated buyers of LNG. And we have signed them at good terms that underpins the project. So we haven\u2019t seen -- there is speculation about the condition of the worldwide LNG market, but from our -- certainly our recent experiences it's been very good for those two projects.\nMark Gilman: Okay, John, thanks very much.\nJohn Watson: Okay, Mark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.\nJason Gammel: Thank you. Maybe one more on the production profile, John, I appreciate your comments about growth through the end of the decade and clearly 2014 plus with Gorgon Wheatstone and perhaps more treasury, those have quite a bit visibility. How should we think about the interim period between 2010 to 2013 seemed to be more or less or flattish environment?\nJohn Watson: Yeah, Jason what I prefer to do and I'm going to punch just a little bit. We want to give you some guidance on 2010 and your observation about middle of the decade and Gorgon Wheatstone is accurate. What I would like to do is maybe differ until March where we'll give you a little longer, a little more complete look at both the interim period and we see coming project by project and in a lot more detail fashion rather than treat that today. So if you\u2019re listening till March we'll be happy to give you more information.\nJason Gammel: Fair enough. Maybe one if I could then. Three more successes during the quarter and Australia obviously a great drilling environment there. Can you talk about the volume metric objective that -- what you're drilling in Australia right now on these TCF cost type structures and maybe give an update on the overall resources space that you believe you\u2019re having a great bargain [ph] area at this point?\nJohn Watson: I will say yes, yes and no. We have announced some five discoveries this year in Australia, and I would say in an overall sense despite these discoveries have been a little bit smaller than some of the very large ones in the past, but they have a nice additions and will augment the supply that we have for both Gorgon and Wheatstone. And in fact what you'll see from George when he talks a little bit more about this as we continue to accumulate volumes it not only raises confidence in the existing project where we have ample resource but it also starts to give us volumes that will help us underpin expansions there. As you know we have ambitions to produce more, ultimately at Gorgon subject to regulatory and permitting considerations over time and Wheatsome [ph] is a hub, which we\u2019ll be starting at two trains and we\u2019ll have the capacity to bring in actually several more trains over time. So these discoveries really do underpin some of that, some of that future growth. In terms of our aggregate gas resources we've talked in terms of 70 Tcf in the Asia Pacific region. So we have a lot of gas in that area. And we\u2019ll give you a little more granular information on that in March.\nJason Gammel: Okay thank you, John.\nJohn Watson: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: Hi John, welcome back, John.\nJohn Watson: Thanks Paul.\nPaul Sankey: Pat, you did address this in your comments but if you could just remind me, going back to the volume outlook for 2010, what did you say about the external constraints that you have or haven\u2019t baked in? I am trying to get to what the range of outcomes could be there, particularly with due to OPEC in Nigeria?\nPat Yarrington: Right, we said that the outlook does not assume any OPEC curtailments or security constraints or even market constraints.\nPaul Sankey: Fair enough. And if I look backwards, it feels like the range of outcome there based on what you\u2019re showing for what happened in \u201909 is about, let\u2019s say 100,000 barrels a day either way, if we can bind all of them together.\nPat Yarrington: Well, I mean, those are all very circumstantial elements, and I\u2019d hate to, I\u2019ll let you make your own forecast going forward about each and every one of those, frankly. That\u2019s why said we didn\u2019t put it in.\nJohn Watson: Predicting production plus or minus 1 or 2% as my upstream friends [ph] tell me as it's a very tough business given all the factors out there, but there is a range around to be sure, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: Got you. And then if we just look at Q1 of \u201810 to date what is the size of that impact in Nigeria and OPEC right now?\nPatricia Yarrington: We have about 20,000 barrels a day shut-in for Nigeria.\nPaul Sankey: OPEC?\nPatricia Yarrington: Nothing.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. Nigeria. Related question, could you just update us on your best [ph] customer of what\u2019s happening in Ecuador and any headline risks around that? Thank you.\nJohn Watson: Sure. Well, Paul, as you know, we have made very significant disclosures and I know you\u2019ve read the material that we have online. I guess what I would tell you is that the Court in Ecuador appears to be headed toward a verdict; I am not going to predict that but based on the pattern in the courts there and systematic reduction in the application of rule of law, there could be an adverse verdict, and if so, we will vigorously defend ourselves not only in Ecuador but in the United States or anywhere else that they might choose to go to seek enforcement.\nPaul Sankey: Yeah, I was really thinking if I look back a year now we were looking for, I think, way back for adjustments around October of last year. Do you have any sense when this might finalize?\nJohn Watson: Well, I think people are looking for a verdict around that time and then that little problem with the judge, as its may recall, was shown to not be impartial and we\u2019ve captured on video and he had to be replaced and so there is a new judge there and I am not going to predict when he might produce a verdict and what that verdict might be.\nPaul Sankey: Fair enough, John. I will leave at that. Thank you.\nJohn Watson: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: Hi, thanks for taking my question. First on your CapEx, can you give us a sense of the CapEx curve for Gorgon, just for example how you might spend there in 2010?\nJohn Watson: I mean Gorgon and Wheatstone spending for 2010 will be about $3.5 billion. And so it\u2019s a sizable chunk of our capital spending both in 2010 and through to middle of the decade.\nPavel Molchanov: And just to refresh have you given your total CapEx estimate for the overall project and how have they evolve as you\u2019ve completed FID?\nJohn Watson: Yeah, the number that we have given for Gorgon for the 100% project amount has been $37 billion US, and that\u2019s still the number. Interestingly enough we have placed a considerable number of contracts against that and so far it seem to be right on track. Of course now we can change a little bit as currencies move over time, but that project we are very pleased with. We had an outsiders in outside agency that looks at major capital projects and they've indicated that they feel that Gorgon is the best prepared mega project they ever seen. And so we are very encouraged and where that heading but we're gong to be very vigilant on that project. We of course have to get it right with that level spend.\nPavel Molchanov: Yeah, that\u2019s helpful. And just a quick downstream question finally, can you give us any thoughts on what you're seeing on the import front in your West Coast market?\nPat Yarrington: Frankly because of the absolutely dismal conditions in the West Coast, imports have found another place to go because the margins just haven\u2019t been here. I mean, we're heavily oversupplied on the product side gasoline inventories above the five year averages, margins very depressed, and actually continue to be so on the West Coast here through the early part of January. So its \u2013 I don\u2019t think imports are finding a welcome home here.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks, that\u2019s helpful thanks guys.\nJohn Watson: Okay I think we\u2019ve got one more question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng: Hey thanks for taking the follow-up. John, every management they have somewhat of a different philosophy, and I know you work closely with O'Reilly before. But from your standpoint is there any major change in how do the top 100 management they are performing and compensation is being review or being calculated or what is the most important driver under your administration? Thank you.\nJohn Watson: Well, in terms of compensation in management, I have had the good fortune to actually work very directly with everyone on our management committee. And we have a very strong group of people, and I feel very fortunate to have a great team around me, both at a very senior level and down through the organization. So \u2013 and we've had a long standing instead of compensation practices that I think provide the right types of incentive and motivation. My priorities right now, Paul, one as I indicated in my remarks, you should see a great deal of strategic continuity. The strategies that we have in place have serviced very well. If I could describe my emphasis early on, it would be ramping it up in terms of our focus on execution in the business and it's not factory stuff, it's very direct things around capital stewardship, our continual reliability effort, systematic looks at cost. So that\u2019s certainly number one. I would tell you that I\u2019ve talked internally a lot about people in the organization. We have a great deal of debt, the industry is going through a crude change, if you will, over the course of the next decade, and we are well prepared for that. But we need to be sure that we are developing our people appropriately, and making sure that the younger folks that we have been hiring over the course of this decade are going to be well prepared to take charge. And then the third thing that I have talked about with our employees is growth going forward, execution, of course, is part of delivering that growth in the near term. But maintaining our edge on key technologies is something that I will emphasizing particularly around seismic imaging, reservoir management and drilling where we are very good and a leader today and need to continue that and then capturing new opportunities. I think our business model is the best in the industry, where we have delegated authority and strong leaders in country, and we need to take advantage of that with our overall capabilities to continue to add to the portfolio and deliver growth. So, those are the things that I am emphasizing with our organization. Paul?\nPaul Cheng: Okay, thank you.\nJohn Watson: And I think with that -- that concludes our remarks. I would like to thank all the analysts for their good questions. I will just remind you that we will come back and give you a lot more detail in March and we look forward to see you at our major meeting then. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes Chevron\u2019s fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-10-30 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session and instruction will be given at that time (Operator instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Dave O'Reilly. Please go ahead.\nDave O'Reilly: Thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yerington, our CFO and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2009 and we'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. But before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements, so please review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Turning to slide 3, which provides an overview of our financial performance, let me cover a few points. The company's third quarter earnings were $3.8 billion, or $1.92 per diluted share. Our third quarter 2009 earnings were down 51% from the third quarter of 2008. Third quarter earning were 120% higher than second quarter 2009, and Pat will be discussing this shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 12.6% and the debt ratio was 10.4% at the end of the quarter. Our net cash flow position this quarter was positive by nearly $2 billion after funding our capital program, dividend commitments and $700 million in pension contributions. This positive cash generation was underpinned by higher crude oil prices and strong cash margins from our major capital projects. I'd like to give a brief recap of our strategic progress in recent months, so please turn to slide 4. Our industry-leading expiration program has continued to success with the recent discoveries in Angola and Australia. In Angola, we announced the Block 0 discovery and the Greater Vanza Longui Area. The discovery well encountered over 225 feet of net pay. This discovery extends the trends of undeveloped natural gas condensate and crude oil discoveries that are currently undergoing an appraisal. We also announced three natural gas discoveries this quarter in Carnarvon Basin offshore Western Australia. The three discovery wells Clio-2, Kentish Knock-1 and Akalase [ph] are all located in Australia's premier hydrocarbon basin, where Chevron is the leading leaseholder. All three blocks are Chevron-operated and add to our significant gas resources in Australia. Our upstream major the capital projects continue their strong performance. Offshore Nigeria Agbami project reach nameplate capacity of 250,000 barrels a day in August 2009. This was over four months ahead of schedule. Production efficiencies to-date has been excellent and volumes are steady these target rates. Offshore Angola, Tombua and Landana is Chevron's most recent major project for Block 40. It achieved first production in the third quarter and drilling of additional wells continues and peak product of the 100,000 barrels a day is expected to be reached in 2011. In the United States, we recently enter feed for deepwater Big Foot project. Big foot is located in the Walker Ridge area of the Gulf of Mexico 35 miles south of Chevrons\u2019 Tahiti field. The development facility designed as a Tension Leg platform and it would be the deepest build to date. Chevron is the operator with the 60% interest. In Australia we announced a final investment decision for Gorgon. This occurred in September and has a significant milestone for the company. We expect Gorgon to add to our reserves and provide stable and steady production for decades to come. The project has around 40 trillion cubic feet of resources, which is equivalent to about 6.7 billion barrels of oil. Gorgon is three-train, 15 million metric ton per year and is well positioned to meet growing Asian demand for natural gas, and it will be a legacy asset for the company. Following the final investment decision milestone, we\u2019ve assigned long term sales and purchase agreement representing greater than 40% of our Gorgon off-take. We also held up agreement in place for a roughly another 40% of production and expect to finalize these agreement in the coming months. Also, in Australia, we recently signed agreements with two companies to join our Wheatstone LNG project. Together the two companies will be 25% partners in the project\u2019s first two LNG trains. Chevron will maintain our current interest in Wheatstone and Iago fields, as our partner\u2019s natural gas supply will be coming from their own field. This establishes Wheatstone as an LNG hub, and we anticipate that additional Chevron and third party gas will be available for a future expansion, now that foundation project is in place. For example, our recent Clio l [ph] discoveries to provide additional volumes; and this will support Chevron\u2019s strategy to commercialized gas in Australia, and also enhance it\u2019s project economics. We answered front-end engineering for Wheatstone in July 2009, and expect to make a final investment decision in 2011. I will now turn it over to Pat, who will take us through quarterly comparison. Pat.\nPat Yarrington: My remarks compare the results of third quarter 2009, with the second quarter of 2009. And as a reminder, our earnings release compares third quarter 2009 with the same quarter a year ago. So turning to slide five, third quarter earnings were up $2.1 billion from the second quarter. Stronger upstream earnings accounted for all of this improvement, driven by higher crude oil realizations and a continued production ramp up of our major capital projects. Upstream earnings also benefited from roughly $400 million of Gorgon related asset sales and tax items, as well as a favorable foreign currency variance of about $400 million. As a reminder, these foreign currency earnings impact are predominantly related to balance sheet translation and do not have a cash impact. Third quarter downstream results were essentially flat with the second quarter. Favorable timing effects and improved west coast margin were offset in part by unfavorable foreign currency effects. Also recall that the second quarter included a $140 million benefit from asset sale. The variance in the other bar reflects higher chemical earnings more than offset by an unfavorable variance in corporate items. On slide six, Our US upstream earnings through the third quarter were about $600 million higher than the second quarters result. Combined crude oil and natural gas realization benefited earnings by $300 million. Chevron\u2019s average US crude oil realization increased about $10 per barrel between consecutive quarters, more than the nearly $8.50 increase in the average spot price of WTI. Natural gas realizations were flat between quarters. Production volumes increased more than 6% between the quarters as the ramp-up to up Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico more than offset natural fuel declines. In settlements of certain insurance claims related to Hurricane Rita contributed the $110 million to the current quarter result. And the other bar is like primarily lower impairment charges and lower DD&A rate. Turning to slide 7, our international upstream earnings increased about $1.5 billion compared to a second quarter results, higher oil and natural gas realizations improved earnings by $520 million. Our unit realizations for liquids improved by 16% in line with the increased in Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations were also higher in the third quarter contributing about 25 million to earning. And as Dave mentioned, our Gorgon LNG project in Australia reached a final investment decision in September. This formal project to approval trigger recognition of roughly $400 million in gains on sales of partial interest in the project and related tax effects. This equity are realigning between Chevron and our partners occurred and cash was received in 2005, but the earnings impact was appropriately differed until project sanction. The FX bar includes continued losses associated with the weakening of the US dollar against several major currencies, although the impact this quarter was nearly $400 million less than in the prior quarter. The other bar is the benefit of $201 million, about half of which due to the absence of second quarter well write-off. Lower DD&A rate and higher lifting account of the majority of the remaining variant. Slide eight , summarizes the change in worldwide oil equivalent productions, including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada. Production increased 32,000 barrels a day between quarters. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing contracts and variable royalty provisions by 21,000 barrels per day. The base business and external constraint bar shows a decline of 46,000 barrels per day. Reductions due to base business declines and local disruptions in Nigeria were partially offset by lower OPEC member constraint. By early September, Nigerian oil operations were back to normal. And as George Kirkland mentioned in our second quarter call, we expect our full year based business decline rate to average about 6%, which is consistent with year-to-date result. As shown in the green bar, increased production from major capital project benefited third quarter productions by almost 100,000 barrels a day, primarily driven by the ramp-up of Tahiti and higher volumes that TCO and Agbami. Turning to slide nine, US downstream earnings increased about $130 million in the third quarter. The overall impact of refining and marketing indicator margins accounted for the entire $130 million increase. Marketing margins improved especially on the West Coast, where we refinery outages and maintenance combined with driving season demand drove retail prices higher. Timing effects, represented a $75 million positive variants, in large part due to the absence of unfavorable effects in the second quarter. WTI prices were essentially flat from the beginning of the quarter, third quarter compared to $20. They were flat in the beginning to the end of the third quarter compared to a $20 per barrel increase during the second quarter. In addition, like the aviation pricing created a positive variance in comparison to the second quarter. The components making up the other bar include reduced volumes due to Richmond planned third quarter 2009 maintenance, downtime and lower lubricants margins. Turning to slide 10, international downstream earnings decreased about a $100 million from the second quarter's result. Timing effects represented $250 million positive variance between the quarters consistent with the US, this mostly reflects the absence of unfavorable timing effects in the second quarter. Impacts on the third quarter were much less, reflecting a lower pricing volatility. The next bar shows the absence of $140 million of gains on assets sales recorded in the second quarter. Foreign exchange effects were negative $75 million, compared to the prior quarter and the other bar is a negative variance of $131 million, about half of which is attributable to an unfavorable tax variance. The remainder is comprised of several smaller items, including higher operating expenses related in part to increase transportation cost. Slide 11, shows that earnings from our chemical operations increased $56 million in the third quarter results for Oliphant's, aromatics, and Oronite additives, all reflected higher realized margins. Slide 12 covers all other. Third quarter net charges were $167 million, compared to a net $43 million charge in the second quarter. The increase of over $120 million between quarters, mostly reflects variances in tax items and foreign exchange effects. The all other charges for the second and third quarters were below our guidance range of $250 to $350 million per quarter. Now on slide 13, I would like to wrap up by providing a brief summary of our operational performance through the first three quarters of 2009. On the second quarter earnings call, we raised our production outlook, we indicated, a year over year 5% volume increase, our major capital projects continue performing on plan or better, and on a year-to-date basis, we have achieved a 6% increase. Assuming constant prices, we now expect to exceed the 2009, full year production outlook, as we communicated on the second quarter call. Our year-to-date, refinery crude utilization remains strong, at 92% of capacity. Solomon has recently released its 2008 result. Solomon as you know, is an external benchmarking organization that gathers data on the refining industry and reports out every two years, so for two consecutive by annual reporting periods, Chevron has held the number one ranking in refinery utilization, compared to the 8 other international majors tracked by Solomon. Our success in increasing refinery reliability contributed to these results and we believe that will be critical in this challenged downturn environment going forward. Our stream major capital projects are meeting or exceeding expectations with many starting and ramping up ahead of schedule. Over the past five quarters, we have delivered six significant operative projects , Agbami in Nigeria , the Tengiz expansion in Kazakhstan Blind Faith in Tahiti and the Gulf of Mexico, Frade in Brazil and Tombua and Landana in Angola. Combined, they represent a growth investment of over $25 billion with projected total peak production in excess of 900,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent. Our continued focus on cost management is delivering results to the first three quarters of 2009. Operating and SG&A expenses were down $3.5 billion, compared with the same period of 2009 on a recurring basis as mentioned in our press release; we are running about 13% below last year. So, we are ahead of our $2.5 billion or 10% reduction goal that I communicated on the second quarter call. I know that this figure excludes fuel. Our focus on aggressively managing cost will continue and we expect to see further positive results from our efforts. And finally, we are maintaining our strategic focus on the factors that will ensure our growth and our superior returns to stock holders in the year ahead. Now that you all know our Chairman and CEO, Dave O\u2019Reilly has announced his retirement at the end of this year. I will be remised if I didn\u2019t acknowledge and thank Dave for his more than 40 year of service to the company. And in particular I would like to acknowledge his superior leadership of Chevron over the past 10 years as CEO, during which time our market capitalization has grown about $100 billion. So, thank you Dave. I will now hand it back to you Dave for your closing comments.\nDave Reilly: Well, thanks, Pat. I would like to spend a few minutes talking about management transition, as Pat pointed out, I have announced my retirement at the end of the year, and John Watson will become Chairman and CEO in January. This is part of a well planned succession process. John is a proven leader, who has played pivotal role in many significant accomplishments in recent years, including leading the merger integration with Texaco. He brings a mix of corporate and operational experience, having served as President of our International Exploration and Production operations and also as our CFO and Corporate Vice President of Strategy Planning. John has also been actively engaged in formulating our current strategies as a member of the company's Strategy and Planning committee for over 10 years. John is supported by a very strong team including George Kirkland, who will join the Board and continue to lead our upstream oil and gas businesses. Our strategies are working well and the company is performing well, but I think even more importantly the company is in very capable hand, and I expect a seamless transition. I\u2019m very proud of our accomplishments and deeply indebted to all of the people of Chevron for their dedication to the company during the time of my leadership. I also want to express my thanks to the many of you who are investors in the company. I've enjoyed our association over the years and I wish all of you the best for the future. That concluded our prepared remarks; we now welcome your question. So, Sean, please open the line for question.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Dough Terreson with ISI Group.\nDoug Terreson: First I want to congratulate you Dave on a great career and I agree with Jeanette [ph] you provided exemplary leadership during the past decade which is obviously been an important period of change for the super major. So good luck to you. On cost the release mentioned a 13% decline in your recurring expenses, which is obviously a pretty significant number. And on this point, I wanted to say if you would provide some color on the rate of change that is, how its movement in the capture rate on recovering cost in relation to previous couple of quarters?\nDave O'Reilly: Pat, do you want to can handle that question.\nPat Yarrington: Sure, yes.\nDave O'Reilly: Because I think its good question and we are very proud of what we will accomplished and I think we are on good run.\nDoug Terreson: Sure.\nPat Yarrington: Doug, I think that we have continued to gain momentum on our cost reduction effort as they quarters have progressed here. A lot of the activity that we did in the earlier part of the year obviously we\u2019re sitting down meaning one-on-one with the suppliers and vendors and to large extent, many of those contract renegotiations began to trigger in the second quarter and will continue on in the third quarter. So, we have tremendous amount of momentum behind us and as well as going forward. So, I would look forward to further positive results on this dimension going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Kessler with Simmons & Company.\nRobert Kessler: Couple of things from me. Firstly the tax rate, I am wondering Pat, if might be able offer us a clean tax rate figure recognizes with some of that $400 million from Gorgon item is buried in there and lowering the tax rate, and then any guidance going forward on that. And then secondly, just wondering if he might be willing to comment last year status of your Northwood [ph] prospect in the Gulf?\nPat Yarrington: Well, I\u2019ll take tax question here, Dave. Yes, third quarter to second quarter, we did see our reduction in our tax rate of nearly 10%. The Gorgon related items were significant piece of that as were foreign exchange losses, those were about equally large contributors to that. So obviously, going forward you are not going to have of the Gorgon related component. But frankly foreign exchange is very hard for us to in any way predict. So, it\u2019s hard for us to give you advance version of quarter clean number might look like. Lot of variables moving in a lot of directions, with a lot of jurisdiction and a lot of component, so I don\u2019t have guidance for you.\nDave O'Reilly: I didn\u2019t quite catch the prospect you were.\nRobert Kessler: Northwood.\nPat Yarrington: Northwood.\nRobert Kessler: Northwood, Paleogene prospect in the Gulf of Mexico?\nDave O'Reilly: I don\u2019t think I am free to say anything about that at the moment. I apologies for I can\u2019t, but I can\u2019t comment it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: Gorgon, the CapEx number, could you give us an ideal of what that\u2019s going to be. We\u2019re working with the idea that it\u2019s about $35 billion spend before 2015 growth ruled upon us.\nDave O'Reilly: We describe that pretty clearly on our press release, when we announced the projects the number was AUS43 billion. If I recall, I don\u2019t have the press release in front of me, but I think that was the number. I might add that project just come from Australia, to check on the initial excuse of that project and the work is already under way on Barrel Island, there between $6 billion and $10 billion were the contracts have already been let. So this think is out, its very well planed and is already in the early execution phase and I was very, very pleased with what I saw there.\nPaul Sankey- Deutsche Bank: Dave, the contracts that are signed are the going to be the classic oil price link?\nDave O'Reilly: Probably yes, the sales contract themselves.\nPaul Sankey- Deutsche Bank: Yes, sorry I should have said the sales contract.\nDave O'Reilly: Whenever we move to the other sides of the project. Yeah these are essentially oil very close to oil parity oil link contracts. And as I mentioned, 40% of the volumes have already been executed and the others are very close within the next three months.\nPaul Sankey- Deutsche Bank: Good, okay.\nDave O'Reilly: We are pleased with the progress there and thank you for the question.\nPaul Sankey- Deutsche Bank: Sure, and then if I could ask my second question on the forex issue again? My understanding was tended to work against you when the dollar weakened, but it seems to be fruitfully and I understand it\u2019s not a cash issue and everything else, but it does seems to work in your favor this quarter and that confused me a bit, could you just help me understand why it's kind of going the other way from somewhat?\nDave O'Reilly: I think it was negative of the both quarters, but just a little bit less negative, so quarter-to-quarter it worked positively, but it\u2019s still negative on in absolute return. It was dramatically negative in the second quarter, not quite as negative in the third.\nPat Yarrington: That's because the rate of the currency changes, second quarter versus third quarter were different, a much greater weakening in the second quarter than in the third quarter of the US dollar.\nPaul Sankey- Deutsche Bank: So the general trend remains same, or if we get a strengthening of the US dollar is going to work in the opposite way, okay. I understand that. Thanks a lot.\nPat Yarrington: That's correct.\nDave O'Reilly: That is correct. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: Thanks for taking my call and congratulations on those strong quarter and congratulations to both, John, David and your new roles as well also previous contributions. I had a one question for you guys and it's a less favorite topic, but there have been some supportive facts for Chevron and the Ecuadorian proceeding. I know you've had motion for normal as well as the collateral action in the international arbitration, a hedge against the government now the preceding judge is on as off is one the case is off the case. Can you provide us with just any general update on timing or kind of facts around what's pending in the judicial process of for those claims in the what\u2019s the hurdle before you may expect some kind of ultimate opinion to be rendered in the in Longui Area.\nDave O'Reilly: Well, thank you for the question and the comments. The answer on timing is we really don\u2019t know. I mean we are going through period of appealing with the new judge. He has as you point out there, know the judge, there is one of the judge that judge that was previously on the case, for that we have accused himself and he was reinstated and he was accused again, so we are definitely now with the new judge we did file an appeal for a Normand our motion for Normand which this judge has in recent in the last week of so denied, but to be able to predict as timing in a court system that is a totally unpredictable and unreliable. I think is just difficult to do. In the normal court process, this judge would be going very carefully through all the rulings that were made by the prior judge and spending considerable amount of time on evaluating the circumstances, so it's very hard for us to put a timetable on that. You mentioned the international arbitration, there\u2019s really two issues there. There\u2019s one long standing commercial claim issue, relative to the government\u2019s refusal of to rule itself and its own courts in Ecuador on money that we believe is due us over the course of original contract. Then we have a second one much more recently filed which is really a breach of contract on basic fundamental contractual issues itself we believe, and we believe just the finally that the Ecuadorians are responsible for the damage that exist there. But Ecuador has chosen not appoint his arbitrator yet on that one, even though the dead line for appointing an arbitrator has passed. So these are all very hard to project from timing prospective and I wish I can give you a clear picture. So that\u2019s that we have at the movement.\nEvan Calio: Is this judge Zambrano is he overseeing any other elements of the case if you know it\u2019s been a longer history.\nDave O'Reilly: I don't know that answer, but I don't think so. I think he is new to the case, but has been in the same court. There is a panel of judges, so he is part of the same court system but not \u2013 I can\u2019t answer the question that he is ever been a longer in case, I don't think he has directly as a judge but I am not sure.\nEvan Calio: And one last question if I may, on the way out, just if you could provide us any other your projects moving into FID still on track (inaudible) Phase II, Caesar Tonga, Chongdong Bay [ph] now any.\nDave O'Reilly: Basically there is been no real change. Chongdong Bay [ph] is I was also in China recently and that is moving along, all the government approvals have now been obtained. So we are actually in addition to the preliminary work which was done, we\u2019ll now be ramping up. And preliminary work is kind of securing wells and some infrastructure work that could be done early, but now we\u2019ll be moving into the kind of full execution phase later. So the Phase I of their product is moving along very well. We have a volume Phase II that is still on schedule. We\u2019ve got Perdido which were partnered up in the deep water which is scheduled to come on in the first quarter of next year. So, we got, we basically everything else that we talked about Aven [ph] is pretty much on plan in general terms.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.\nArjun Murti: Let me off my congratulation and best wishes as well and do thank you for your help over the years. My question is really on US shale gas and if you could provide any comments on what interest you had into the building up a more meaningful position there. You also have the big Australia LNG positions and a lot of gas elsewhere, U.S. shale gas maybe one area possible opportunity. And then give an update to some of the status of the Jack/St. Malo project and where that isn\u2019t moving along to FID. Thank you very much.\nDave O'Reilly: First of all, on shale gas, shale gas and tight gas overall we have a presence in the Hansville \u2013 it\u2019s a land that we control, so we can control the pace of that. We have been doing some development drilling to test the most economic way to develop that and then the other area of tight gas, of course, is in the Piceance, where we have basically slowed down our progress there. We are building the capacity to produce 60 million cubic feet a day or so there. We have an upload capacities to supply that for some time. But as George mentioned in earlier calls, we have curtailed our gas activity somewhat because we have the discretion to do it and made that decision made last year because we could see that the gas market was going to be very weak and so we focused this year primarily on the oil side. Other than the big projects, the long-term projects of course which are in next oil, in the case of LNG. So that was a deliberate decision on our part. I don\u2019t want to speculate about what we might do further in Shale other than its something that we are interested in and we\u2019ll continue to pursue, but we are using this time to develop the expertise to do that as efficiently as we possibly can, using our drilling expertise and which we have in great depth in the company.\nArjun Murti: I think Dave that not to interrupt, that really is sort of the question. I am not asking if you are going to do an acquisition or anything. But can a large super major like yourself, really be effective than shale gas. You are very good at the big projects around the world. It sort of the US E&P opportunity whether that\u2019s something for you.\nDave O'Reilly: I know we can, because if you what we are doing in Thailand, it\u2019s very instructive. We drill rapid fire well in Thailand, in the Gulf of Thailand and have been doing so. Unocal was the forerunner of that and when we combine Chevron and Unocal, we have been able to ramp that up and strengthen even further. So our drilling organization and our company is quite capable of multiple well programs and we demonstrated that capability. What we are demonstrating right, working on right now is making sure we understand, what it is that we have to replicate time and time again because what we will be doing in the shale is somewhat different than the drilling we are doing in the Gulf of Thailand. So, I feel pretty confident it can be done, but we have to be able to it at scale to move the needle and that is what we were proposed to do. Your second question I think was on Jack/St. Malo.\nArjun Murti: Yes.\nDave O'Reilly: That is coming along ,well, it is front end engineering. It is expected that we will get to an investment decision in2011, also maybe not that, I\u2019ll think about it, I think it\u2019s late next year, 2010, late 2010, and everything there is pretty much unplanned that is always discussed at protocols and in our meetings direct in New York in March.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.\nJason Gammel: I was hoping to ask you a broader question on the refunding and marketing segment of the business, worldwide basis margins are obviously quiet poor right now, it seems to be a lot of over capacity. What are your thoughts on how that segment of the business gets back to a better margin environment and how long that is going to take? And may be if you could just add your strategic positioning, and how do you think you are advantage or disadvantage relative for the rest of the industry?\nDave O'Reilly: That's a big question. Well, first of all on the micro level, it is, we are headed for a weak period here. The golden age of refining didn't last that long, but we are into a weak period until we see the obvious combination of demand growth and some form of rationalization occur among the weaker players and in the more, oversupply areas of the globe. That's why as a company that we have chosen to invest primarily in what we consider to be the growth areas and that's been the West Coast of the US and the Pacific, where the growth characteristics are clearly more robust and I think that is playing out. Having just been in Asia, you can see that the markets there, the economies there are growing and that is going to lead to growth in demand that will be ahead of what we will experience in the United States and certainly ahead of what we'll be experienced in Europe. I think our strategy, which is to focus on the growth areas and then strengthen those growth areas by culling out the parts of our portfolios that don't match up to what we are trying to accomplish strategically is the right strategy and it's the one we have been pursuing for sometime and we will continue, I think to pursue along that path. The only other point I would make, that advantages have been relative to our size, I think our refining portfolio is so much smaller, but clearly more focused in these growth areas, and I think it will take a few years for this to kind of work its way through then I would expect 2010 and 2011 to be pretty sloppy before we see this begin to come back into better balance.\nJason Gammel: Thanks, Dave I appreciate your thoughts and best wishes for the future.\nDave O'Reilly: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng: Dave, I just want to say congratulation and best wishes with your retirement. Thank you for the older [ph] half. If I could have two questions, one, Dave, you are talking about the Wheatstone. When you guys are going to start in terms of the sales effort, and if we look at between 2014 with the Gorgon coming on stream into 2017 with you guys Wheatstone and maybe the PNG and also plateau a number of very large projects still going to come on-stream. Have you guys sense that whether the market is still be able to absorb all those additional cargo and be able to maintain your pricing power there? Any kind of evident that would be helpful. The second related to the $3.5 billion of the cost saving Pat mentioned. Pat, can you elaborate a bit more in terms of breaking down whether by different component, the labor to the vendor or anything like that, or by segment, that will be very helpful. Thank you.\nDave O'Reilly: I'll take the first one as you ask and then Pat will take the second one, Paul and thank you for your kind remarks. Wheatstone, we're very, very pleased with the progress at Wheatstone, not only on the supply side, where we've made this arrangement now with Apache and KUFPEC to augment their supply and have them participate obviously in the first two trains at Wheatstone. The good news is that we're finding tremendous interest in the gas itself from the market, and I am absolutely conveyance that we will have successful out come here. Just as we have done another projects, we will execute heads of agreement with the appropriate parties that will be contingent on final investment decision. Just as we have done with Gorgon, and you will see continue to see progress in this area as we move the project along during the coming months and next year.\nPaul Cheng: Can I interpret the marketing of the Wheatstone gases already started, that you are not waiting until you finalize the sales for Gorgon.\nDave O'Reilly: No absolutely. The sales on Gorgon are almost at a conclusion right now. The final SPAs on the outstanding sales that we talked about are almost complete. I think I mentioned that in my remarks earlier. So our big efforts right now is on the marketing of Wheatstone and we are finding a very receptive market, and I think one that clearly is going to be needed, given the growth that we are experiencing in Asian demand. So, on the operating comps questions I am going to turn that back to Pat. Pat?.\nPat Yarrington: Paul you asked for a little bit more information on the cost side. Let me just start and say, of the $3.5 billion year-over-year reduction, our estimates are that about two-thirds of that is sustainable and about one-third is associated with self help. The cost reduction that were seeing is generally across the board, uniformly across all of our business segment and transportation is clearly a large component of that as is contract labor, material supplies services. It is really a very broad based, cost reduction success story that we\u2019re having.\nPaul Cheng: Pat I am sorry so you said two-third yet sustainable and one-third is self-help what exactly that mean between sustainable?\nPat Yarrington: On a go-forward basis we were down $3.5 billion year-over-year. Some of that is non-recurring, for example last year in the third quarter we had significant hurricane impact. So on a go-forward basis we are saying two-third of the reduction that you are seeing here we believe it\u2019s sustainable component. Okay.\nPaul Cheng: And that\u2019s mean that two-thirds of the sustainable, you said one-third is self-help or that is over three and half and one-third is self-help.\nPat Yarrington: Of the $3.5 billion one-third is self help, the other relate to a kind of general market indicators, lower activity, kind of global demand, market-related our components.\nPaul Cheng: And your $3.5 billion is not including energy due cost right you said?\nPat Yarrington: The $3.5 billion does include a small, very small energy fuel component.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Is it?\nDave O'Reilly: It is less than 10%.\nPaul Cheng: Pat is it possible you can break down the $3.5 billion by divisions?\nPat Yarrington: I don\u2019t want to do that Paul. As I said it\u2019s pretty ratable in terms of the $3.5 billion reduction it\u2019s very valuable according to the cost incidents, the original cost incident by our business segment.\nDave O'Reilly: The bottom line of all of this Paul is that about two third of this totally sustainable, about one third of if it is price sensitive, such as fuel and transportation those sort of things. So, that two thirds year-over-year we feel it is pretty about and some of it is related to that hurricane impacts and a lot of itself help as well. So, we\u2019re seeing it all, but we are not going to break it down any further for year than we would for anybody else.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Flannery with Credit Suisse.\nMark Flannery: I\u2019d like to talk about capital cost? You\u2019ll talking a little bit about operating cost on this call. Other companies have pointed to some reductions on the capital side are you guys seeing that particularly in the upstream. If so, could you give some idea of the magnitude, then I have follow-up after that.\nDave O'Reilly: Well, I am going to have Pat address a few of these. Well, we are seeing some, it depends on the category of cost, capital cost where we\u2019re seeing some reductions clearly and I will have Pat address just a little bit more triangular response to some of that.\nPat Yarrington: I\u2019ve said in the past call that depending upon which cost category you are talking about, we\u2019ve had cost reduction ranges anywhere from 60% on the high end, if it\u2019s highly commoditized product versus 10% on the low end if it\u2019s something much more specialized. We have seen and we\u2019ve also stated in the past, in terms of our 2009 capital program, a large portion of that was already committed in our pre-committed before coming into the 2009 calendar year. So, the cost reduction activity lower capital cost activity you\u2019ll see is really going be somewhat in 2009. But really in 2010 and going forward. And I am sure you are paying attention to just as we are the upstream CERA cost, capital cost indices and you\u2019ve seen that they came down, they kind of they turned over. But they are not following nearly at the same rate of they that they were earlier in the year. So with higher up prices we have seen little bit a dampening of that particular slop. But year-over-year we are going to see some benefit in \u201909 for lower capital cost and we expect to see some continued benefit of that going forward in 2010.\nMark Flannery: My second question is on decline rate. And you reference was George said, earlier in the year underlying decline rate would be about 6%, little bit lower in the 7% that has been talked about before. With oil prices where they are let\u2019s just call amazing dollars [ph] for ease. Is that scope to get that number down further do you think in 2010?\nDave O'Reilly: Go ahead, Pat.\nPat Yarrington: I was just going to say, on that one we really need we are putting our planes together now. We really need to finish that process and provide you better indication of that when we see you in March of the analyst.\nDave O'Reilly: I just going to add to Mark, I think that the underlying decline rate this year will be about 6% and as we pointed out that relates to deliberate decisions made. Primarily in the natural gas area where the prices were weak and it\u2019s too soon to predict what was going on, rather than I think we demonstrated a agility here that, that we made the right decision on how to invest some of that discretionary capital at the beginning of the year and it\u2019s paying off right now by having a leaning towards oil and lessen the near-term gas. I think by demonstrating that agility you can count that it will be demonstrated in the other direction if its appropriate, and we\u2019ll make that read as we get closure to next years plan\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Gilman from Benchmark\nMark Gilman: Just two questions if I could please, one relating to the Block Zero discovery announcement and the trend day which I believe you referred to. I am curious as to whether this is a new play, relative to your long standing activities in Block Zero or whether it merely extension those that which you being doing previously in terms of the horizon, that you\u2019ll be exploiting and then I\u2019ve got a follow-up.\nDave O'Reilly: Well, it\u2019s not really a new play, we\u2019ve had number of areas of Block Zero even though that we have been in it for some time, that we obviously deferred exploration and until we got the extension of Block Zero, which we concluded a few years ago. So I wouldn\u2019t carry crises this a new play, but just a further validation, I think that we are in a very oil and gas rich area and that were exploiting and investing as you expect us to do, now that we have that contract extend for the next 25 years or so.\nMark Gilman: Second question relates to production sharing contract issues generally speaking. If you work-off the production bar chart, in essence you\u2019re talking now I believe would be a sensitively about 2,000 barrels a day per dollar per barrel price change, which is higher than what has been discussed in the past, and you\u2019ve indicated that this will move around. But I noticed in particular, frankly, both with your results as well as those of others that there seems to be some hypersensitivity with respect to Indonesian volumes lately vis-\u00e0-vis this issue. Can you folks offer some observations as to what might be going on this regard?\nPat Yarrington: Mark I don\u2019t know that we have any particular insights share. We have indicated that tremendous kind of volatility or variability around a range of oil prices here. Indonesia is one of the primary contributors to that variant there, but I don\u2019t know that I can speak to anything unique or uniquely different about Indonesia in this time period.\nMark Gilman: And Pat, nothing changed there in 2009 from structural standpoint?\nPat Yarrington: Not that I\u2019m aware of, no.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein.\nNeil McMahon: Okay. It\u2019s all the way from (inaudible). Just turning two questions; one really on Gorgon. If you look at Gorgon, and the development of all the LNG plants that you\u2019ve got going there plus sellers. What is your sense that these projects will actually be developed on time, given the fact that so many people are putting a lot of construction capacity in to an area with extremely limited resources and infrastructure, that\u2019s really the first one.\nDave O'Reilly: Well, that\u2019s why I was there and heard just a week or two ago. I think the good news is that we have the contracts plus the projects are moving forward and it\u2019s the first one out of the gate really in that area. There hasn\u2019t been much new activity, and being first I think, gives me some assurance that this one is going to move a long way. By all the experts we\u2019ve looked at, they believe that this project is best prepared for execution of any major project that they\u2019ve seen. So I am pretty confident that this one is out of the gate fast and already working. A lot of the work is on Australia, but some of it is outside Australia as well, and is using the so modelization [ph] contract that are already been led that we fabricated in Korea and other place. So this I think is an exemplary project, and I think the question for the longer term is one that we will have to weigh around some of the other projects as well and that is ensuring that we phase them in, and that\u2019s one of the reasons that we put Wheatstone behind Gorgon because we think that the peak, we want to pass the peak of Gorgon and on the down slope before we pickup Wheatstone. So I think we\u2019ve got a very good integrated plan to look at this in kind of orderly manner. So I think that\u2019s the answer to your first question. You had another one.\nNeil McMahon: (inaudible) Will you be utilizing the same construction contractors and quarry for Wheatstone and the same as Gorgon?\nDave O'Reilly: I think the answer to that question no. The seat contract with Wheatstone is a different contractor than with Gorgon. And that\u2019s as far as I\u2019ll go on that one.\nNeil McMahon: And just a final quick one from me. Given your footprints in Asia, any comments in terms of overall Asian refining, refining product in that part of the world.\nDave O'Reilly: Well I mentioned that I had just come back from them and I see there is no question that there is a pickup in demand. The China stimulus package is pretty affective and definitely making an impact on demand and so I think that the Asian refining system will recover sooner than say North America or Europe, and I feel pretty positive about it. The momentum and the focus there is more than I would I have expected. Having been there a year ago and seen everything come to a stop it\u2019s quiet amazing, how they have been able to turn that around. So I feel pretty confident that the outlook for Asia is still going to be sloppy, I think in Asia in 2010, but it shouldn\u2019t prove sooner than some of the other areas of the world We have probably got time for about another one question, we are reaching the top of the hour so let me, let\u2019s take an other question here.\nOperator: Okay, our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: Two questions about Gorgon. First just to clarify, the 40% figure you mentioned on the off-take does that only pertain to Chevron\u2019s interest or is that the entire project?\nDave O'Reilly: No, that\u2019s our interest only. And as I mentioned, we expect to double that in the next month or two.\nPavel Molchanov: And then the second point, how should we think about reserve bookings from Gorgon, now that you guys (inaudible) and particularly do you expect any reserve bookings this year.\nDave O'Reilly: Yes we do. We have it FID [ph] there will be reserve bookings and I can\u2019t obviously say what those would be, but this will have a positive impact on our reserve replacement for the year.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks very much.\nDave O'Reilly: I think we got to wrap it up folks. I appreciate your interest in the company and thank you for your questions, and again I want to thank all of you for your good questions and your support during the year, particularly those of you who that have been shareholders for my tenure with the company. So, I thank you very much and if there are any further questions. Please follow it up with Jeanette and the staff. Sean, thank you for your help and we are finished.\nOperator: Thank you sir, ladies and gentlemen this concludes Chevron\u2019s third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-07-31 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Thanks, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today are George Kirkland, Executive Vice President Global Upstream and Gas; and Jim Aleveras, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2009 and we will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company\u2019s second quarter earnings were $1.7 billion, or $0.87 per diluted share. Our second quarter 2009 results were down 71% from the second quarter 2008. Second quarter 2009 earnings fell 5% compared to the first quarter of 2009, which Jim will discuss shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 17%. The debt ratio was 12% at the end of the quarter. While debt balances were relatively flat during the second quarter, cash balances ended the period approximately $2 billion lower than the prior quarter. The cash change reflects working capital effects unique to the second quarter. For example, nearly half of the cash consumption in the second quarter pertains to a full-year 2008 foreign tax obligation that was accrued last year but was paid in May 2009. The amount is particularly distortive because it was based on the much higher earnings level of last year. And finally, as we announced on Wednesday, Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.03 per share, or 4.6% increase in the common stock dividend payable on September 10, 2009. Jim will now take us through the quarterly comparisons. Jim.\nJim Aleveras: Thanks, Pat. My remarks compare results of the second quarter 2009 with the first quarter 2009. As a reminder, our earnings release compared second quarter 2009 with the same quarter a year ago. Turning to slide 4, second quarter earnings were down $92 million in the first quarter. Starting with the left side of the chart, higher crude oil realizations increased the company\u2019s worldwide upstream earnings. However, upstream results were adversely affected by a foreign currency variance of about $500 million between quarters. Second quarter downstream results were sharply lower than the first quarter. This decline reflects lower margins in the second quarter, along with lower gains on asset sales. The second quarter included a $140 million benefit from asset sales compared to the $400 million gain recorded in the first quarter. The other bar largely reflects improved chemical earnings and a favorable swing in corporate tax items. On slide 5, our U.S. upstream results for the second quarter were about $250 million higher than the first quarter\u2019s results. Combined crude oil and natural gas utilizations benefited earnings by $310 million. Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realizations increased about $16.35 per barrel between consecutive quarters, almost the same change as average spot prices of West Texas Intermediate. Natural gas realizations, however, fell between consecutive quarters, offsetting about $75 million of the benefit of higher crude oil prices. Production volumes increased more than 4% between quarters. The start-up of Tahiti, the ramp-up of Blind Faith, and continued hurricane restoration efforts in the Gulf of Mexico more than overcame natural fuel declines. The other bar includes the benefit of lower operating expenses but these were more than offset by impairments of several small fields which flowed through DD&A and some other items. Slide 6 summarizes the result for our international upstream operations, which were essentially unchanged between quarters. On a combined basis, liquids and natural gas realizations improved earnings by $625 million. Our unit realizations for liquids improved by 35% compared with a 33% increase in brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations, however, were lower in the second quarter, offsetting about $100 million of the benefit of higher liquids realizations. Exploration expense increased $90 million between quarters, reflecting well write-offs spread among a number of countries. The FX and other bar shown largely reflects a swing of more than $500 million in foreign currency affects between quarters. Slide 7 summarizes the change in worldwide oil equivalent production, including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada. Production increased slightly between quarters. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing contracts and variable royalty provisions by 24,000 barrels per day. Based on the $16.50 change in average West Texas Intermediate prices between the first and second quarters, this translates into a roughly 1,500 barrel per day impact, compared to the rule of thumb we provided six months ago of 1,200 barrels per day for each dollar WTI price change. In the interim, we have looked at all of our production sharing agreements and variable royalties and this study reemphasizes our earlier caveats, that the effects are non-linear and any rule of thumb is very rough. Given the volatility in crude prices, no single rule of thumb is appropriate as forward guidance. Therefore, we will continue to quantify our price and volume effects for you each quarter. Moving on to the next bar on slide seven, the decline of 44,000 barrels per day shown under the caption base business and external constraints, includes a number of items. First, the total base business decline was 58,000 barrels per day but over 40,000 barrels per day of this amount was due to planned turnaround activity in Kazakhstan, Canada, and other countries. The same bar also reflects a 20,00 barrel per day benefit of Hurricane restoration, partly offset by a 14,000 barrel per day change in Nigerian production due to local disruptions. External constraints, such as OPEC, [inaudible] whose government limitations, and Asian gas market factors were slightly less limiting than in the first quarter. This change was minimal, about 8,000 barrels per day. As shown in the next bar, increased production from our new major capital projects benefited second quarter production by 75,000 barrels per day, primarily reflecting Agbami, Tahiti, and Blind Faith. George Kirkland will provide a more detailed discussion of our major projects in production in a few minutes. Turning to slide 8, U.S. downstream earnings declined about $230 million in the second quarter. The overall impact of refining and marketing indicator margins was an adverse $75 million. The average change in our total margins between quarters was $130 million in addition to the $75 million amount reflected by the indicator margins. The major factor was refining mix effects due to a decrease in distillate refining margins, a decrease in light heavy crude spreads, and other factors such as higher refinery feedstock costs. As these impacts were not fully captured by the indicator margins, our realized refining margins were more unfavorable than suggested by the indicators. Additionally, lubricant base oil margins were lower due to weakness in the industrial and commercial transportation markets. Higher sales volumes increased second quarter earnings by $75 million. This improvement is about the same amount as the adverse volume variance we showed in the prior quarter. We completed the planned turnaround maintenance at our El Sigundo California refinery that I mentioned last quarter and this accounts for the difference. The other bar reflects timing effects and a number of minor variances, including higher fuel costs due to higher prices. Timing effects represent about half of this variance between periods. WTI prices rose about $20 per barrel from the beginning to the end of the second quarter compared to a $5 per barrel increase during the first quarter. The changes we\u2019ve discussed before, including phasing out provisional pricing for our major supply contracts, have reduced the volatility of our U.S. downstream earnings to changes in commodity prices. However, we will continue to experience timing effects related to market factors, such as lag pricing terms for aviation fuel, along with inventory and supply effects. Turning to slide 9, our international downstream earnings fell about $435 million from the first quarter\u2019s results. On balance, refining and marketing margins reduced earnings by $55 million between quarters. Both refining and marketing margins were lower in Asia, our largest international region. Timing effects represent a $90 million adverse variance between quarters. On an absolute basis, timing effects reduced first quarter earnings by about $140 million, while the second quarter effect was about $230 million. The largest single component of the $90 million quarterly change was a $60 million impact of lagged aviation pricing terms. During the second quarter, we closed the previously announced sales of our fuel marketing operations in Cameroon and Kenya. However, the gain of $140 million was $260 million less than the amount recognized in the first quarter for the sales of marketing businesses in Nigeria and Brazil. Various items, including lower trading profits, partly offset by lower foreign currency losses, made up the majority of the $29 million variance shown in the other bar. Operating expense, which dropped substantially in the first quarter, and stopped slightly in the second quarter, partly on higher fuel costs. Slide 10 shows that earnings from chemical operations were $108 million in the second quarter, compared with $39 million in the first quarter. Results for oliphants, aromatics, and [oranite] additives all reflected higher margins. Oliphants and [oranite] additives also benefited from higher volume. Slide 11 covers all other. Second quarter net charges were $43 million, compared to $294 million in the first quarter. All other charges were below our typical guidance range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects favorable corporate tax items, a swing from foreign currency losses to gains, and lower corporate and service company net charges. Before turning the call over to George Kirkland, I would just like to briefly recap the second quarter. First, upstream earnings benefited from higher crude oil prices but these were largely offset by substantial adverse foreign currency effects, in line with the interim update. Downstream results reflected weak margins, adverse timing effects due to the increase in commodity prices, and lower asset sales gains, also mentioned in the interim update. As we projected, all other net charges were below the guidance range. Finally, and most importantly, our operational results were strong, upstream production to refinery utilization. George Kirkland is now going to provide an update on our production outlook for 2009 and further discuss our upstream projects. George.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Thank you, Jim. It\u2019s good to be back to discuss upstream performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year. I am very pleased with our progress through the first half of 2009, particularly in the areas of project execution, production, and cost management. And I am going to address each of these areas. Let\u2019s now move to slide 13. Production performance from our major capital projects in the first half of this year has been strong. 2009 production growth from these projects will likely exceed the 300,000 barrel a day forecast we provided at the fourth quarter earnings call, and shows both the strength of our major capital project queue and our ability to execute. The bulk of the production increases come from four major capital projects. Tahiti achieved first oil on May 5th and reached peak production within three months. That was six months ahead of schedule. Current production is at full capacity of 135,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The ramp-up of Agbami has reached 220,000 barrels of oil a day and is ahead of our schedule to reach peak production of 250,000 barrels of oil per day. SGI/SGP at Kazakhstan is performing above the nameplate capacity of 240,000 barrels a day. De-bottlenecking activities are currently underway that should allow for higher oil production by year-end. And finally, blind faith reached peak production of 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in late March. Due to the performance of these major capital projects, combined with lower OPEC and market constraints, and lower base business declines, which averaged about 6%, we now expect the full-year outlook for 2009 to be about 2.66 million barrels a day, an increase of 30,000 barrels a day from our previous guidance. This translates to a 5% increase over 2008 levels of 2.53 million barrels a day and includes both the impact of security related disruptions in Nigeria that have caused -- excuse me, includes both the security related disruptions in Nigeria that have caused significant shut-ins. This revised outlook is based on an average oil price of $50 per barrel, and of course changes in price will impact this outlook. Other progress to be noted in the first half of 2009 is as follows -- Frade achieved first oil on June 20th. This is Chevron's first operated asset in Brazil. We expect Frade to reach peak production of 90,000 barrels a day in 2001 [sic] as additional development wells are drilled. And Mafumeira Norte in Angola block zero achieved first oil in July, once again ahead of schedule. Production is currently ramping up and forecasted to reach a peak production of 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2011, as additional development wells come online. Turning now to slide 14, I would like to discuss some of the other significant achievements that occurred during the first half of 2009. Yesterday we announced that Wheatstone and Wheatstone L&G project in Australia entered feed as a two-train development. This significant milestone demonstrates our progress towards sanction. It follows the announcement in February of a successful seven-well exploration and appraisal program that underpins the two-train development. Also in Australia, we received a conditional recommendation from the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority on the expanded Gorgon project. This is excellent news and we are on schedule to sanction the project later this year. In Nigeria, we remain on schedule to sanction stage two of the Agbami field. Stage two development wells will extend the peak production plateau of 250,000 barrels of oil a day. In the partition neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, steam injection the large scale steam flood pilot began in late June, with pilot success a full field development of the [WAFRA EOCENE] reservoir will follow. This field contains over 12 billion barrels of oil in place and would be the first commercial application of a conventional steam flood in a carbonate reservoir. In Angola, we now forecast Tombua-Landana start-up during the third quarter of 2009. Hook-up and commissioning is about 90% complete. It is expected that three wells will be available at first oil. Tombua-Landana is projected to reach 100,000 barrels a day by 2011 with development drilling. And finally, in Indonesia, the start-up of the non-operated South [Natuna] Sea North Belut field remains on schedule for the third quarter of 2009. Let\u2019s now take a look at slide 15. I would like to talk about our upstream cost structure, which includes production expense, DD&A, and other expenses. This chart shows the competitiveness of our cost structure and has been updated since our securities and analysts meeting in March. For 2008, we had industry-leading up-stream costs for $20.05 per barrel. During the first half of 2009, this has improved to $19.87 a barrel. Lower production expenses and higher DD&A charges almost offset each other. On a unit of production basis, DD&A charges increased by $2.22 per barrel during the first half of 2009, compared to full-year 2008. This was principally driven by the investments associated with new project start-ups at Agbami, Blind Faith, Tahiti, and [Moho Belondo]. Although the DD&A associated with these new project start-ups is high, this is to be expected and is a function of how crude developed reserves are booked over time. Let me offer an example -- take a deepwater project like Blind Faith. DD&A rates at start-up are calculated based on the project investment but only a small portion of the resources booked as crude reserves under SEC guidelines. However, as additional crude reserves are booked and the capital depreciated, the associated DD&A rate will significantly drop over subsequent years. Early in the project\u2019s life, earnings may be impacted due to the higher DD&A but cash margins are generally at their highest levels. And remember, we base our investment decisions on cash flow. Now let\u2019s turn to production expense, because DD&A is only part of the story. In the upstream through the first half of 2009, production expenses were $2.52 per barrel, less than full-year 2008. This is a function of lower operating expenses and taxes other than on income. This reduction has more than offset the increase in DD&A. I am pleased with our progress on managing our production costs and this will remain a key focus for us. Pat will provide further insights on Chevron's cost management activities and with that, I would like to turn it over to Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Thanks, George. Slide 16 provides a progress report on our aggressive company wide efforts to reduce cash costs of running the business. We\u2019ve targeted a $2.5 billion reduction in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009 compared to 2008. The target excludes the benefit associated with lower costs of purchase fuel. All areas of the company are working to reduce costs -- upstream, downstream, corporate departments, and our internal service and technology organizations. And at mid-year, we were ahead of pace to meet the full-year objectives. Some key areas of focus in our push for cost reduction are listed on the slide -- materials and supplies, transportation expenses, and contract labor and third-party services. Our recent downstream asset sales, notably in Brazil and several West African countries, removed costs relative to the prior periods and this was anticipated in our target. On the upstream side, particularly in North America, we have reduced activity related to well work-overs and are contracting fewer rigs at lower rates. This makes good business sense given the economics of these activities, in particular in relation to natural gas prices. As a note of caution, please keep in mind that the operating expenses will not be perfectly ratable throughout the year due to seasonal and other effects, such as turnaround activities. Nevertheless, we are very pleased with our progress. I would like to wrap up our prepared remarks with a recap of Chevron's operational performance through the first half of the year. This is slide 17. As George discussed, our up-stream production remains on track for a good year-over-year increase with our major capital projects performing on plan or better. Our year-to-date refinery crude utilization remains a strong 93% of capacity. We\u2019ve had no significant unplanned shut-downs and the [thoman] utilization rate for our operated refineries is right at plan level. George described our up-stream project execution, which is on track. And Jim mentioned that our downstream portfolio upgrading continued last quarter and we expect further progress on this initiative in the quarters ahead. As I just outlined, our cost management efforts are progressing quite well. And finally, we are maintaining our strategic focus on the factors that will ensure growth and superior returns to our stockholders in the years ahead. In addition to funding the long-term growth components of our capital program, we are continuing our strategic staffing initiatives to ensure that we have the future technical expertise in Chevron to remain a top performer. That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019d now like to welcome your questions. Please try to limit your follow-up questions so that everybody has an opportunity to participate. So Sean, please open the lines now for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: Good morning, everyone. You mentioned the $500 million variance in the forex, which seems and correct me if I\u2019m wrong but it does seem to be somewhat bigger than your rivals. I think [inaudible] yesterday was less than -- well less than $600 million, obviously off a bigger base. Could you just help us understand how much of that is, if you like, an accounting effect and how much is an operational effect? Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Paul, these are balance sheet translations and it reflects where we have -- where we do our business and the relationship of the currencies from period to period. So a lot of this occurred in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, the Pound, et cetera and we had currency appreciations there, local currency appreciations versus the dollar between 8% and 16% in the quarter.\nPaul Sankey: Okay, so essentially the entirety of it is a balance sheet item?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, it\u2019s a book item.\nPaul Sankey: Okay, and conceptually, if the dollar -- I don\u2019t want to be too negative here but if the dollar continued weakening forever, would you just continue to -- is there a limit to how much this can be or can it just keep going on forever?\nJim Aleveras: Paul, it would fluctuate based on our relationship between liabilities and assets.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right.\nJim Aleveras: Depending on whether they are a net liability position or a net asset position, we can see a larger, smaller, or no effect from strengthening or weakening of the dollar.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, of your monetary assets.\nJim Aleveras: Monetary assets.\nPaul Sankey: Okay, I\u2019ve got the general idea so maybe we\u2019ll follow-up. If I can have an upstream one as well, please, and what -- you had several different moving parts in -- where it included your base business decline. Could you, to make it simple, just strip out what you think your base business decline was for the quarter? And then I have just a follow-up on up-stream and I\u2019ll leave it. Thanks.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Paul, let me try to do it in the context -- we try to give a view of where we think base business is going to be for the year. Through the first half of the year, it has been significantly below our 7% guidance. It\u2019s been more in the 5% range, 4% to 5% range as best we can track it. Once again you have to take a lot of ins and outs with turnarounds and everything else and security and everything else going on. Our present forecast for the full year is we were going to average about 6%. Now, if you go back to our analyst meeting in the first quarter, or the January call, we said at that point that we were basing our outlook for the year based on a 7% base business decline and at this point, we see that decline as going to be less than we had earlier forecasted, by 1% at least.\nPaul Sankey: And any idea for next year, George? Would that go faster again, or --\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Paul, I really hate to talk about next year until we get our capital program put in place.\nPaul Sankey: If it was the same capital program as this year?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: It would probably be more in line with the 7% because we reduced our base business capital significantly and that\u2019s driven heavily in the United States around our investments in the gas side of the business. Just to give you a little more color to that, I expect by the end of the year, we will not have a single gas land rig running. We are redeploying our efforts to where we can within our ability to move equipment around and contracts around to really focus on oil in the United States. Gas prices, it doesn\u2019t make sense for us right now to be drilling those gas well.\nPaul Sankey: So the [inaudible] of the incremental decline would be basically U.S. gas?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I think it\u2019s going to be heavily U.S. gas. We\u2019ll be able to tell you a lot more after we get through our business plans so first quarter call, I guess January call next year and analyst meeting, we\u2019ll be able to give you a lot more color on that.\nPaul Sankey: Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng: First, Jim, I want to say thank you for all the help over the past couple of years and wish you a happy retirement.\nJim Aleveras: Well, thank you very much, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: We will miss you. I think I have two questions -- one, Pat, you talked about the cost savings is now ahead of pacing at mid-year. How much of the benefit so far that you\u2019ve seen is related to FX, and how much is really just coming from the [vendor] or raw material costs coming down?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good question, Paul. Really from an FX standpoint, it\u2019s a factor but it\u2019s not a significant factor. And I guess the second component you were asking about is sort of the energy related drivers?\nPaul Cheng: And also all the other raw material costs and everything.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, it\u2019s -- clearly it\u2019s a factor in there. We haven\u2019t segregated it out on a raw materials component factor uniquely or discretely. We have cost reductions, I think as I mentioned on the call last time, that depending upon the commodity or the product category, you can get price reductions here or cost reductions here that have ranged from 60%, the more commoditized the service or equipment is, to 10% or 20%, the less commoditized it is.\nPaul Cheng: Maybe I have missed it -- Pat, have you said an exact number that how much you think that your cost-saving is at this point?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: We said that we -- you mean on a year-to-date basis?\nPaul Cheng: Yes.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, we are down more than the 10%. We said we are ahead of pace. The 10% is our target for the year. We said we are more than 10%. We noted in the press release on a quarter-to-quarter, second quarter this year to second quarter last year, that on a recurring basis we were down 15%. We did have some non-recurring items in the second quarter of last year that we didn\u2019t have in the second quarter of this year. They were not repeated, so timing effects like this can occur but they typically even out over the year. So I just encourage you to look at the 10% target and to know that so far we are ahead of pace.\nPaul Cheng: So so far, you are about $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, you\u2019ll see it when we put out the 10-Q, and just know that there some non-recurring elements in there.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. If I could have one quick upstream, George, in Iraq, when you are looking at the opportunity set and the risks associated and the kind of terms that they offered in the first round, if that maintains, is that really a pace that you guys will be very keen on to invest? Also, if you look at the security situation on the ground, has it improved sufficiently for you to feel comfortable to put your people on the ground at this moment?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Paul, I think you can tell that -- or maybe not. We didn\u2019t really submit a bid on the first round in Iraq. We could not see a conforming bid at that point work for us on an economic basis. We like Iraq when you think about the resource side, phenomenal resource. We look at it, we would like to be there but we need to have confidence both in the economic viability of the investments and the security side. So you\u2019ve got to look at both elements of that and we weren\u2019t able to see that in this first round. And the way the first round has ended up, really not -- really the bid did not prove to be that successful.\nPaul Cheng: In the first one, you didn\u2019t put a bid -- is it more of an economic concern or is there a security concern from your standpoint?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I would say at this point it was more an economic concern.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call and also, congratulations, Jim, on your retirement. I have just a quick question on Gorgon. I listened to your comments on the conditional improvement. Could you walk me through, walk us through exact details on the path to FID for Gorgon?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I will give you some of the color. There\u2019s a whole lot of things that must happen. First, most critical item is of course getting our EPA approval. We need to get our environmental permit to build Gorgon on Barrel Island. That\u2019s critical step one. Of course, we have to have all our partners between now and that period have their own internal approvals. We need from the government all the leases ratified, I guess I think would be the best word. So we\u2019ve got to put in a -- our development plans for production. They have to be approved. But I think the most critical items is one, the environmental permit -- nothing can happen until we get the environmental permit. And then second is of course all the partners in Gorgon to give their financial approval to move forward. Those are the two critical steps. There are a lot of other little steps that go with it. We think we are very, very close on the environmental permit and we\u2019ve done all our due diligence and all the project due diligence I think to be ready on the decision-making around the economics.\nEvan Calio: Excellent. Do you -- another question on the up-stream -- are there any hurricane volumes that remain shut in or any color on timing of bringing back those volumes on-stream?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I think we are at about 87% of our volumes that were impacted. We will bring another 5% to 8% on. We\u2019ve always been telling everyone that we didn\u2019t see maybe as much as 5% that would ever be restored and I think most of this remainder will be on by the end of the year.\nEvan Calio: Okay, great. Just one other follow-up on the decline issue, if I understand, and I know it\u2019s CapEx related -- your 7% decline versus the lower 4% at prior CapEx level, you know, is really U.S. gas-driven event.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Predominantly.\nEvan Calio: Is that fair?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: It\u2019s a predominantly -- we\u2019ve cut down all base business. We\u2019ve got some issues around the world too where we have base business that could be impacted by OPEC constraints that we would look at very similarly to what we are looking at U.S. gas.\nEvan Calio: Okay.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I mean, it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend the money and build capacity where we are not going to be able to produce it.\nEvan Calio: Sure, but I mean also, you get a higher decline base meaning that that 7% could taper lower over time, if you -- there\u2019s a lot of variables in that, the math, but is that the -- kind of the correct thinking?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Well, the big thing that is going to happen over time is more and more of these large projects come on, they do not see the decline in the early periods. Many of them have multi-year, five years some of them, and some of them longer, flat lives. You look at a -- like TCO, [Tengeze], and the investment we\u2019ve made in SGI/SGP, that second generation plant there, that is almost a flat line. It is not a function at all of the reservoir. It\u2019s only a function of the plant capacity and the plant capacity doesn\u2019t go down. It stays up, so you have to look at each one of them but more and more as we get more and more of these large new assets on, that base of production has very, very low to no decline rate, so it will change over time. And we\u2019ll have to give you updates on that at least a couple of times a year on what we are seeing happening.\nEvan Calio: Excellent. Thank you for taking my question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.\nArjun Murti: Thank you. Thanks for the color on the DD&A rate. Were there any charges or other things that ran through DD&A in the first half, if I take that 220 a barrel you mentioned, there still seems to be a little bit of a gap. I was just wondering if the $3.1 billion rate in 2Q is sort of a run-rate going forward.\nJim Aleveras: Arjun, that\u2019s a good question. If you look at the information in our press release, you can see that our six-month 2008 DD&A was about $4.5 billion versus almost $6 billion for six months of 2009. The major capital projects account for about 55% of that but then there\u2019s a lot of other things that I mentioned last quarter that do impact DD&A, things such as impairments that run through that, accretion expense. So there\u2019s a lot of different items, as well as base business, that impact DD&A in addition to our major capital projects but I do want to say the major capital projects were the largest single item and accounted for more than half of the increase. But if you look at overall DD&A, the increase is all in the up-stream segment?\nArjun Murti: That\u2019s great. That\u2019s very helpful. And just a final one -- any update on how you are thinking about stock buy-back at this point?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Arjun, as we\u2019ve expressed several times here, the stock buy-back piece is really the most discretionary component of our uses of cash and the priorities are for the dividends, which you saw the board increased, funding the capital program, and keeping a good balance sheet. And for the moment, that\u2019s where our priorities are and I don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not reinstating the share repurchase program at this time.\nArjun Murti: You guys clearly have an exceptionally strong balance sheet and I\u2019m not a die-hard stock buy-back person but maybe in this challenging economic environment, you just want to keep an even stronger balance sheet than even is normally considered strong?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, I think we just -- you know, we have a lot of organic opportunities here and maintaining flexibility, financial flexibility is important to us.\nArjun Murti: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein.\nNeil McMahon: Hopefully you can hear me, the line is not great -- maybe a few for George. I didn\u2019t pick up when Tahiti was going to hit peak production, if it hadn\u2019t done so already. And also on that, being of the upstream, just wondering when you were going to start to think about drilling in the sub salt in the [campus] basin around Frade, if there was an opportunity to do that going into 2010. And then I\u2019ve got a final follow-up.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Well, Tahiti, I tried to make that in the early comments, we have reached peak production, the facility is really designed for about 135,000 barrel equivalent per day. We\u2019ve reached that already. We ramped up all the wells very, very quickly to that, so it\u2019s going very positive. Like all cases, we\u2019re always looking to see if we can get a little more efficiency out of our facilities but we will reach the nameplate capacity and like I say, very, very quickly. Frade, I think it\u2019s too early for us to start thinking about the sub-salt there. We don\u2019t have a lot of opportunities for us in the basin at this point. We have some but it\u2019s -- we are limited with our lease holdings there so we are going to have to look to the future and future opportunities in Brazil.\nNeil McMahon: Okay, and then just a very general question again for yourself -- a number of your competitors this week have come out with statements that have suggested that one company\u2019s got the best set of assets in the industry and another one has -- is the industry leader in terms of its options set and the upstream going forward. Just wondering how you would classify your upstream position, given the fact that obviously you are, based on your competitors, you are at least third in the rankings for some reason.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: There\u2019s been a lot of good work done by analysts and consultants out there and I think almost consistently they have always said Chevron has if not the best, one of the very best queues of project in the industry. I think you can look back at the number of projects that we brought online in 8 and 9 and what we are bringing on in 10 and see the steps we also are taking going forward with Gorgon and Wheatstone and the quality of those assets, the next generation facility that we will bring to [Tengeze]. We\u2019ve got a 400,000 barrel a day expansion that we can do there, and our position in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the lower tertiary, the first one of those projects come on in Perdito early next year. We just moved Jack St. Mallow into feed. We announced the discovery of Buckskin earlier this year. We\u2019ve got a great queue of projects there so these -- and all of the projects I have just mentioned have very, very attractive development costs. So I am not aware of any other company that\u2019s got a better queue of projects.\nNeil McMahon: Maybe we need to look into it a bit more but thanks for those comments.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Howard Weil Inc.\nDoug Leggate: Good morning, folks. Jim, you are going to be missed -- the changes you\u2019ve made over the years have been really appreciated and I will miss working with you.\nJim Aleveras: Thank you very much, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: A couple of questions -- I am going to take advantage of George being there, if that\u2019s okay. The color on the cost is much appreciated, particularly on depreciation, given the substantial changes we\u2019ve seen. However, George, is it possible to just give a general kind of overview as to the new projects that are driving the growth, how do the underlying F&D and [by read-through] the future DD&A compare to the base business to try and strip away the timing effects? I\u2019m just trying to understand when we can expect to see some incremental reduction again, or a reversal of this increase that we\u2019ve seen in fairly substantial depreciation? That\u2019s my first one. I\u2019ll have a quick follow-up.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I think it does vary between projects and the type of projects. I would tell you the deepwater projects are the ones that typically see the highest DD&A rates at the beginning. I will tell you they ramp down pretty quickly. The first year with the barrels that have been booked have extremely high DD&A rates. We tend to, during the start-up period, every six months look at reserves and look at reserve bookings, so we often actually make mid-year updates on the reserve picture on these new projects. My expectation in most cases by the third year, we will have seen a significant drop in the DD&A rates. We see it move pretty quickly as we book these additional barrels. So normally I would say within two booking cycles, we\u2019d probably have those down and I would tell you at that point in time, they will be very attractive on a DD&A basis. But the other side of it, and I think what\u2019s really important to recognize, is these projects tend to have the lowest OpEx, operating expense of any barrels we have in the system, and that\u2019s typical for new projects. You don\u2019t make water. Chemical costs typically are low. You have a lot of barrels per person, in effect, so it\u2019s a really good time and you really need to -- what we really look at, of course, is the margin and the cash margin, which is very, very good in those -- on those projects. Does that help a little bit?\nDoug Leggate: It does. George, if I could push you just a little more on that particular issue, would you characterize the profitability, let\u2019s say -- call it unit margin on an all-in cost basis, that is when fuel reserve [inaudible] are in place, as being incrementally better than the base portfolio? In other words, is your capture rate going to start to improve as you deliver these obviously very substantial [inaudible] visibility over the next year or two, in your opinion?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I would think on average it will improve. I think those barrels are better barrels in total on a margin context. But it does -- for us to see it flow on the book side, on the earnings side, it\u2019s going to take us probably in some of the projects, the second or third year to really see that. And once again, it varies greatly between projects. You get a project that\u2019s like [Tengeze], you don\u2019t see the big impact of it because you really have characterized the reservoir and the reserves are a lot more straightforward in the booking. For most of our deepwater projects, the actual performance, the well performance is needed to book additional barrels and that\u2019s why the first couple of years are so important.\nDoug Leggate: Great. My follow-up was actually related to Wheatstone -- the two or three in development going to feed as you mentioned in your remarks, can you just give us some color as to whether you are going to bring in partners to supply the feed gas for those two developments, or is this a 100% Chevron or -- where are we in the process of securing the gas?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Well, I think it starts with we have with our expiration and appraisal work, we know we have enough gas with Wheatstone and Iago to under-write a two-train, two 4.3 million ton per annum trains -- so that\u2019s 8.6 tons per year of LNG that can be covered by the Wheatstone and Iago projects. We would like, and like in all LNG projects, we would like to have a much bigger footprint, more trains. We\u2019ve got other expiration opportunities in Australia, so we\u2019d like to be able to bake a bigger footprint, i.e. more trains. So we are very interested in moving forward with others to open up a bigger opportunity set for the Wheatstone project, or the Wheatstone LNG. So it\u2019s both but I think what\u2019s really important is we\u2019ve got enough gas to get to the two trains ourselves and -- and we\u2019d like to get bigger, because there\u2019s always the -- the money to be made in LNG is all in getting more and more trains and more and more gas through it.\nDoug Leggate: I guess where I am going with this, George, is would you expect to fund both trains 100% Chevron and any incremental trains would involve partners? Is that a fair way of thinking about it or is it not as straightforward?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s that straightforward and it\u2019s in the early stages. Once again, we\u2019ve got enough gas to under-write it. What happens commercially between now and the next 24 months could shape what we end up with there. I hate to leave it open-ended but it is a little bit open-ended on that piece.\nDoug Leggate: No, that\u2019s great color. Thanks very much indeed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael LaMotte with J.P. Morgan.\nMichael LaMotte: George, if I could ask on Nigeria quickly -- can you give us an update on your perspective on the state of clay there with respect to the physical changes? And really where I am going with the question is thinking longer term how you think about allocating capital in light of the risks of change in fiscal terms.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Well, capital allocation everywhere is a function of the economic returns that we will receive. If fiscal terms, either future or retroactively changes to contracts which once again, like everyone we really want to see contract sanctity. But if you look at the go-forward case, if the economic and fiscal terms change, the capital will flow somewhere else. We are not short of capital investment opportunities and the challenge is always making sure we put our capital to those best opportunities and we try to be very, very rigorous in doing that and if the terms in one country in the world become inferior, you can bet that the capital will flow to another opportunity somewhere else in the world.\nMichael LaMotte: Is that true in terms of the incremental CapEx on the same project that\u2019s in queue but hasn\u2019t gone to feed or FID? As well as any expenses you would have on the maintenance or operating side?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: You are getting to a detail level where the economics are really pretty difficult to tell, so you are starting to get into those ones where there\u2019s some grey in there and it depends on the impact, the amount of investment, and the amount of risk.\nMichael LaMotte: And we just don\u2019t know enough yet on any of that yet?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: That\u2019s correct.\nMichael LaMotte: Okay. If I could shift gears quickly, just a couple of clean-ups on the numbers -- 40,000 in maintenance in Q2, is all that back up? Any maintenance plans for the third quarter?\nJim Aleveras: The 40,000 barrels a day of maintenance is partly back up, not fully back up and I do not have our next quarter\u2019s plans yet.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I can just give a little bit of color on it -- the second and third quarter for us are always the heaviest hike, the heaviest turnaround quarters. That\u2019s when you have typically the best weather, so we do have some turnarounds in the U.K. sector, I know, and I do believe we have some additional work that might fall in [Tengeze] later this year, so there is some more work to come but I think we\u2019ve got a lot of the big stuff done.\nMichael LaMotte: Okay, and then lastly on the SGI de-bottlenecking, where is that going to go from the 240 nameplate?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I think our opportunity is in the 10% to 15% increase and maybe even 20%, so we\u2019re pretty confident of 10% to 15% and we may get as high as a 20% bump on that. What we are doing there is the sulfur plant is really what controls the amount of crude that we can put through. We can\u2019t change or increase the sulfur plant capacity so what we have really been able to do is we\u2019ve got a little bit more capacity on the front end of the plant, on separation, and the ability to inject higher H2S gas into the reservoir. And that flexibility is how we are able to get this higher rate.\nMichael LaMotte: Interesting. All right, thanks. That does it for me.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Kessler with Simmons & Company.\nRobert Kessler: Does your conservatism on U.S. natural gas production later this year have any assumption built in for shut-ins, whether due to economic reasons or -- and want of transportation capacity to get your gas to the market?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: No, it\u2019s --\nRobert Kessler: Okay.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Decline rates on U.S. gas are pretty high and we are pulling the trigger, reducing the amount of investment in that arena and it\u2019s going to start responding and declining. Maybe even to give you a little additional color, we have -- in the [Peonce] Basin we have a facility that will be coming on. We have a nice area of development up there -- 30,000 plus acres. We\u2019ve drilled a large number of wells and will be starting up a facility there but we are shutting down all drilling in the [Peonce] and we had plans at one time to be up to even six or eight rigs running there, so we are going to shut down the last rig. We\u2019ve been running to there for a couple of years and we are going to shut that down.\nRobert Kessler: Beyond shutting down to zero on the incremental drilling is there a price below which you would actually turn off the taps?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: That gets more into the supply and demand balance. Of course there\u2019s a price at some point that you are not going to supply gas. I\u2019ve done no work or seen any work that we\u2019ve done in that arena.\nRobert Kessler: Okay. Separately on  [Tengeze], just trying to think about going forward -- now that you\u2019ve got the capacity there, what sort of utilization rate should we think about for those facilities? Obviously you had quite a bit of maintenance last year. I imagine more than normal to tie-in the new facilities but if we think of a normal run-rate utilization, say 2010, 2011 and onwards, how should we think about that?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Mid-90s.\nRobert Kessler: Okay. Good. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng: George, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly -- you said you are not going to have any more active gas rigs at all in the lower 48 by year-end?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: That\u2019s correct on land rigs -- land gas rigs.\nPaul Cheng: Right, land gas rigs.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Land gas rigs by the end of the year, I expect the --\nPaul Cheng: So no [inaudible] or anything?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: No development gas drilling, I\u2019ll go that far. I wouldn\u2019t hazard to say that far on -- we would have anything with regard to workovers.\nPaul Cheng: Okay, no new development drilling?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Right.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. And [inaudible], I think several years ago that at one point you guys were pretty interested, trying to expand your footprint. In the last two or three years, I think you have been pretty quiet or not totally crazy about that. I mean, where are we from a company standpoint? What is your strategy or what is the priority of the oil sands in your portfolio at this point?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Paul, you know we are investing in the expansion of the Albion oil sands with Shell, the Athabasca oil sands project up there. That expansion should come online in 2010. That\u2019s -- on a gross barrel basis, that\u2019s about 100,000 barrels a day and our working interest share is 20%. That will make the footprint we have in Canada, that will give us over -- that with the existing production will give us over 50,000 barrels a day of oil sands production. We like oil sands in the sense of the resource and the location, so that\u2019s a positive. At this point though, the cost of developing it and operating it, it\u2019s tough to make money in a $50 world, so the challenge for us, and we\u2019ve got opportunities participating with our partners to expand up there but we see it needs to happen when we can control the capital costs, bring the capital costs down and when we have a view of higher oil prices. So that\u2019s what\u2019s important for us. With inside our project queue, oil sands makes up a pretty small piece of it and when you look at the economics of it, it\u2019s the weakest set of projects with inside our queue of projects -- weakest in an economic sense.\nPaul Cheng: Very good. Thank you.\nJim Aleveras: Sean, do we have anymore callers?\nOperator: I am not showing any further questions, sir.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, then I\u2019ll just go ahead and close up. Thank you, Sean. Before ending completely here, I just want to reiterate couple of key messages here. Operations ran very well, are running really very well. Project execution is very strong. You heard from George about the volume increases that we are seeing year over year, as planned. We have a strong focus on cost management, a $2.5 billion target, 10% target reduction for year over year. We\u2019re running ahead of pace on that and we are very intent on sustaining that momentum. I appreciate -- we appreciate everybody\u2019s participation on the call today and I want to thank everybody on the call on behalf of everybody on the call for the analyst questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-05-01 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Thanks Sean. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Jim Aleveras, General Manager of Investor Relations is on the call with me. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2009. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two. Slide three provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter earnings were $1.8 billion or $0.92 per diluted share. Our first quarter 2009 earnings were down 64% from the first quarter 2008. First quarter 2009 fell 62% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 which Jim will discuss shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 22%, the debt ratio was about 12% at the end of the quarter and Jim will now take us through the quarterly comparisons. Jim.\nJames Aleveras: Thanks, Pat. My remarks compare results of the first quarter 2009 with the fourth quarter 2008. As a reminder our earnings release compared first quarter 2009 with the same quarter a year ago. Turning to slide four; first quarter earnings were down $3.1 billion from the fourth quarter. Starting with the left side of the chart, lower crude oil and natural gas realizations reduced the company's worldwide upstream earnings. Additionally upstream results were adversely affected by our foreign currency variance of about $600 million and the absence of a $600 million asset exchange gain recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. Partly offsetting was the benefit of higher upstream volumes in the first quarter. First quarter downstream results were also sharply lower than the fourth quarter, largely due to the absence of favorable fourth quarter timing effects. The first quarter included $400 million benefit from asset sales. The other bar primarily reflects lower corporate charges. Slide five, summarizes the results of our U.S. upstream operations, which declined to breakeven in the first quarter. Lower crude oil and natural gas realizations reduced earnings by $480 million. Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realizations were down about $14.60 per barrel between consecutive quarters, somewhat less than the nearly $16 per barrel drop in the average price of West Texas intermediate. Of the $480 million total variance shown on the chart $100 million was due to lower natural gas realizations, which fell about $1.10 per 1000 cubic feet between quarters. The absence of the $600 million gain on our fourth quarter asset exchange transaction was responsible for more than half of the earnings decline between quarters. Lower operating expenses benefited first quarter earnings by $130 million. The other bar reflects lower gas marketing earnings, along with write-offs associated with exploration activities and higher DD&A rates. Turning to slide six; international upstream earnings for the first quarter were about $750 million lower than the fourth quarter's result. Lower oil and gas prices reduced earnings by $465 million. Our unit realizations for liquids fell by about $7.40 per barrel, somewhat less from the $11 per barrel decrease in brand spot prices. Higher first quarter lifting's particularly in Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Republic of the Congo, improved earnings $105 million. Operating and exploration expenses were down $210 million from the fourth quarter, the OpEx reductions were spread among all major geographic areas and multiple cost categories. The FX and other bar is essentially all related to foreign currency effects which were a $644 million gain in the fourth quarter compared to a $33 million gain in the first quarter. Slide seven, summarizes the change in world wide oil equivalent production, including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada. Production rose 123,000 barrels per day or nearly 5% between quarters. Volumes were up 52,000 barrels per day in the United States and 71,000 barrels per day internationally. Lower prices lead to a 46,000 barrel per day increase in our production. More than half of this amount reflected higher cost recovery entitlements and there are Indonesian production sharing agreements. Restoration of production in the Gulf of Mexico after last year's hurricanes increased OEG volumes by 41,000 barrels per day. At the end of the first quarter about 35,000 barrels per day remained off line and are expected to be restored as third party pipelines and facilities are repaired. External constraints reduced production between sequential quarters. Reduced production in OpEx member countries was partly offset by higher natural gas sales in parts of Asia. Our worldwide base business decline of 13,000 barrels per day represents an annualized 2% decline versus our guidance for 2009 of a 7% base business decline. The 7% estimate for the full year is still our expectation. There's just a lag between reduced investment and reduced production. Ramp-up of production at our major capital projects added 65,000 barrels per day to first quarter volumes. Blind Faith, which started up last November and Agbami which is continuing to build to its 250,000 barrel per day target were the two largest components of the increase. Higher volumes from the Tengiz expansion were also a contributor. Last quarter, I provided a general rule of thumb that we expected that each dollar change in crude prices would inversely affect production by 1200 barrels per day. You may have noticed that the volumetric impact of price shown on this chart was a larger amount in the first quarter. The difference reflects the non-linear nature of price effects and reinforces the need for caution using rules of thumb, as I've mentioned before. We'll provide an update on the price volume relationship next quarter. Turning to slide eight, U.S. downstream earnings declined $900 million in the first quarter. The overall impact of lower marketing and refining indicative margins was $160 million. On the West Coast refining margins strengthened somewhat between quarters. But the impact was more than offset by weaker marketing margins. Lower sales volumes reduced first quarter earnings by $80 million. This reflected some plant maintenance at our El Segundo, California refinery along with lower lubricant base oil sales. The variance in timing effects between quarters was $760 million. On an absolute basis timing effects were a loss of about $16 million in the first quarter consistent with the direction projected in our April interim update. The comparable fourth quarter timing effects were $700 million gain. The first quarter absolute timing effects were much smaller due to the phasing out of provisional pricing for our major supply contracts, reduced use of derivatives to lock-in margins as well as the lower volatility of crude oil and refined product prices in the first quarter. Moving to operating expenses; they were a favorable variance of $225 million between quarters, reflecting lower fuel and marketing expenses. The other bar on this chart is a variety of miscellaneous items including trading losses, and an adverse product mix compared to that assumed in the indicated markets. Turning to slide nine; international downstream earnings fell about $360 million in the fourth quarter's results. Unbalanced refining and marketing margins reduced earnings by $80 million between quarters. Margins were down in all regions except Latin America. Timing effects represented a $990 million variance between quarters. On an absolute basis they added about $850 million to fourth quarter results in this segment, while they reduced first quarter earnings by about $140 million. The timing effects in the first quarter were mainly associated with derivatives used to lock in margins and long haul crude oil and refined products. We closed the previously announced sales of our fuels marketing in Nigeria and Brazil which added about $400 million to first quarter earnings. Operating expense was lower across most regions in cost categories for a favorable variance of $170 million. Previous tax items and trading profits made up the majority of the $143 million shown in the other bar. Foreign currency effects were partly offsetting. Slide 10 shows that earnings from chemical operations were $39 million in the first quarter compared with $28 million in the fourth quarter. Results for olefins fell on lower margins. Aromatics earnings increased due to the absence of the fourth quarter impairment charge and some improvement in volumes in OpEx. Chevron's Oronite additives subsidiary had lower earnings due to weak demand. The other bar is due to a favorable swing in foreign exchange effects. Slide 11, covers all other; first quarter results were net charges of $294 million compared with net charges of $365 million in the fourth quarter. Lower expenses within corporate departments and a favorable change in foreign currency effects were partly offset by adverse swing in tax items. The result for all other was within our guidance range. Before turning the call back to Pat, I'd just like to briefly recap the first quarter. First upstream earnings fell significantly due to the absence of prior period gains and lower commodity prices, although production volumes increased, all in line with the interim update. Second, downstream results saw adverse timing effects in contrast to sizeable gains in the prior quarter. These were partly offset by asset sales gains also mentioned in the interim update. Pat will now summarize our operational and strategic progress. Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Thanks, Jim. Turning to slide 12, I'd like to update you on our operational performance so far in 2009. We projected upstream production growth and you saw the 65,000 barrel per day contribution from our major capital project ramp ups in the earlier production chart. We set an objective for reliable refinery operations. For our major operated and affiliate refineries first quarter crude unit throughput was about 94% of capacity, higher than any quarter in the last two years. As we described in our March Analyst Meeting, we're driving for lower costs across the enterprise. We've had well over 1000 individual meetings with key suppliers at the local, regional, national and global levels in pursuit of lower cost. In addition to focusing on cost sourced from third parties, we're aggressively managing down our internal costs. We're driving our own activities to be more cost effective and efficient. Some savings are already being seen. As shown on the prior chart OpEx was down in the first quarter in each segment. In first quarter 2009, before tax operating and SG&A expenses were nearly $0.5 billion lower compared with first quarter 2008. We're also managing our capital and exploratory expenditures. I mentioned our industry leading global procurement processes at our March meeting, we're using these processes to ensure that our capital projects benefit from a declining input cost environment. And we're adjusting the pace of our capital investments to ensure the best returns in the current market. Now a brief recap of our strategic progress in recent months; please turn to slide 13. Our major upstream capital projects are on track to meet our growth targets. Offshore Nigeria, our Agbami project continue to ramp-up on schedule, achieving 175,000 barrels per day by the end of the first quarter and currently at almost 200,000 per day. We're on plan for Agbami to deliver 250,000 barrels per day peak production by the end of this year. In the Gulf of Mexico, Blind Faith started production in November of last year. Production ramped up to its full target of 70,000 OEG barrels per day in March. Also in the Gulf, Tahiti remains on schedule for first oil shortly. Final hookup and commissioning are essentially complete. All six producing wells have been completed and are expected to ramp-up to peak production of 135,000 OEG barrels per day by the end of the year. Offshore Brazil, Frade is on schedule for first oil by the latter half of this year. The FPSO is moored onsite with sub-sea installation and facility hookup underway. Production is expected to reach 90,000 barrels per day in 2011. Offshore Angola, Tombua Landana remains on schedule for first oil in the second half of this year. All top fives (ph) are in place and hookup and commissioning are continuing. Peak production of 100,000 barrels per day is expected to be reached in 2011. In the Gulf of Mexico our Jack and St. Malo project is progressing and it's projected to enter front-end engineering and design soon. Our industry leading exploration program has continued its success with the Buckskin discovery in the Gulf of Mexico Lower Tertiary trend. We also announced the successful completion of a seven well exploration and appraisal program for the Wheatstone, Iago field's offshore Australia. And yesterday the Environmental Protection Agency of Western Australia said that our Gorgon project could meet the EPA's objective conditioned on certain criteria's. We welcomed the decision as we work towards the final investment decision later this year. In the downstream our portfolio rationalization continues to move forward. And as Jim mentioned we recorded a gain of 400 million on the sale of our fuels marketing businesses in Nigeria and Brazil. We're also continuing to focus on refinery reliability. In summary, we're executing our plans to position Chevron for both current earnings and long-term growth. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now take your questions. I'd ask that you please try to limit your follow-up questions so that everyone has an opportunity, to ask what's on their mind. Sean, please open the lines for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Gilman with Benchmark.\nMark Gilman: Pat and Jim good morning to you. I wanted to talk a little bit about the timing on the ramp-up on Frade and Tombua Landana. Any particular reason that the plateau won't be achieved until 2011, with the second half 2009 start up. Is this a development drilling and rig constraint or something else?\nPatricia Yarrington: No, I think it's really just the scheduling around when the producing wells are planned for startup Mark. It's a scheduled plan.\nMark Gilman: There's been no changes in that Pat?\nPatricia Yarrington: There's been no changes in that. We've been very consistent on those schedules for several months.\nMark Gilman: Okay. If I can just add one other follow-up. The $100 million after tax charges the write-offs in U.S. upstream, could you talk just a little bit about what that is more specifically? And I'm assuming -- please correct me if I'm wrong that it's not included in the report of exploratory expense in the quarter?\nJames Aleveras: Mark, it's a combination of things that are primarily exploratory in nature but some of them runs through DD&A. They have to do with write-offs and write downs of exploratory wells, as well as things that are related to that, that we went through DD&A.\nMark Gilman: Jim, that's not usually clear.\nJames Aleveras: Well. I can't be a whole lot more clear than that Mark. That what we have is fairly straight forward here. This is the sort of thing that we see regularly. We have increased dry hole cost quarter-over-quarter. We had things like an unproved property write-down, which runs through the DD&A rate and it's just a number of small items.\nMark Gilman: Okay. We will take it offline. Thanks folks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.\nJason Gammel: Thank you, good morning everyone I had a couple of questions on Western Australian Gas. The first is with the Gorgon environmental approval process now essentially complete is there anything that stands in the way of final investment decision other the final partner approval and would you expect to be able to reach the final investment decision this year?\nPatricia Yarrington: Well, it's a good question Jason thanks. What will happen now is that there will be a period of public commentary. A short -- relatively short period of opportunity for public commentary; we then will need to respond to those issues that are raised in that. We actually believe that by having the Western Australia EPA announcement now and the ability to move through the public comment period and the response period that we are -- we'll be able to stay completely on track with final investment decision before the end of the year.\nJason Gammel: Terrific. That's what we were hoping to hear. And then if I could turn to Wheatstone and Iago, you mentioned that the exploration and appraisal program is complete can you talk about next steps? Will you be moving the project into feed this year, marketing LNG volumes et cetera?\nPatricia Yarrington: We do -- because of the successful appraisal program; we do expect to be able to move into feed in the second half of 2009.\nJason Gammel: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.\nPaul Cheng: Hey guys.\nPatricia Yarrington: Good morning.\nPaul Cheng: Good morning. Pat and Jim; when you were talking about the cost saving, can you give us a number that how much is yield per year, first quarter '08 to first quarter '09, your total cost saving may be and what is that as a percentage to your total controllable cost. I'm more interested in the cost saving if we're excluding the effect from the FX and the energy cost saving?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yeah Paul, I mean I appreciated the question completely and I can understand why you want to have as much segregation as you can. But let me just talk broadly about our emphasis on driving cost lower both from an OpEx standpoint and a capital outlay standpoint. We've met with as I said with thousands of suppliers in these one-on-one meetings all around the global. The meetings are having successes. But as you can imagine, with the contract renegotiations it's not everything starts on March 1st or April 1st or May 1st. So there is a bleed in time to when these new contractual and lower negotiated rates will take effect. So there's not an easy way to get to an absolute number for you. Secondly not everything is moving in this -- in a uniform manner. It really depends on the cost category that we're talking about and how that cost category is linked to economic growth, commodity price levels, supplier concentrations, the amount of backlog that they have in there, fabricating yards et cetera. So on land rigs it's very fluid we've seen reductions of anywhere from 35 to 50% versus a year ago. Major service providers; we've seen contract renewals that are 15 to 20% lower. Obviously any piece of major equipment that's requiring steel will have significantly lower cost. You know as well as I do that steel prices are down 60% from their peak and the same is true for other commodities as well. The fabrication or engineered units are really dependent upon the degree of commoditization of the unit. If it's a unique piece of equipment with strong demand and there aren't very many manufacturers then we're not seeing tremendous amount of price break at the moment. But if it's a more standard more commodity type, engineering requirement and there is flat capacity or -- then we're seeing a high degree of cost pressure is evident we're able to take advantage of that. I think we mentioned at the Analyst Meeting that offshore the deepwater rigs are rig rates are much stickier. And that's due to sustained offshore demand and for some extent capacity constraints near-term. I mentioned in our analyst meeting that we have indexed a number of our contracts. And we also have global master agreements that allow us to really secure procurement leverage. So depending upon the cost category we've seen contract term reductions anywhere from 50 to 60% down to five to 10%.\nPaul Cheng: Pat can I have a follow-up question? In your 2009 CapEx of 22.9 billion the actual is number is more (ph) like 20.6, because you have 2.3 billion is on the on the sign on bonus upfront? What's the -- can you give us a rough idea what's the percentage of that spending that you talked is already a locked in and fixed price contract or that in other words what is the percentage that may be subject to the benefit as the day rate or that the raw material spot rate continue to come down?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yeah, I mean I think a majority of that spending certainly is under contract terms with the contracts having been laid (ph) several months ago. So I think you need to think of a majority of that as not being spot determined. But having said that I mean we are having these discussions with these key suppliers, as we speak and so we're working very hard to pay a secured lower cost.\nPaul Cheng: Very good, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: Yeah hi everyone. Good morning. I just -- looking at your cash balances, with back into a number of around $4.7 billion of cash from operations, if I add the DD&A to the net income and aligned for the $400 million of asset sales. I end up about $1.7 billion below your CapEx number. It doesn't quite jive with the way your debt moved, which seemed to go up more than that over the course of the quarter. Is that a working capital movement or am I missing something completely? Thanks.\nPatricia Yarrington: Yeah that's a good question Paul. I mean we did have an increase in our net debt of about $3.5 million here. This obviously did reflect the poor operating cash flows related to commodity prices. But also importantly there is the capital program amount which did include a significant bonus payment, which is not a ratable sort of thing. But in addition to that we did have a working capital increase. And that principally or there was a significant piece in there that was a non-ratable item that related to a crude purchase and sale agreement that was started a long time ago -- years and years ago, where we had very favorable credit terms on the purchases composed to the sale and -- as it relates to the sale and then that contract terminated in the first quarter. So that is something that you won't see again repeated in subsequent quarters.\nPaul Sankey: Okay I think I understand. Are you expecting, can you remind me what you've been saying about pension contributions for the year in terms of cash?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes. We've said in our -- its not out yet, the number that we've used is $800 million. And that's the number that you will see in our 10-Q when it's reported as the expected contribution for 2009. We're not in a position of having to make a U.S. contribution at this particular point in time, but we're estimating 800 million for both U.S. and non-U.S. contributions.\nPaul Sankey: And just jumping back to working capital the two elements you described to me, the bonus payments and the non-ratable crude contract; would those account for the difference? Did you just give me a working capital number, sorry I...?\nPatricia Yarrington: Working capital was up $1 billion.\nPaul Sankey: I've got you.\nPatricia Yarrington: In the quarter, and a significant piece of that related to this crude buy-sell that I mentioned.\nPaul Sankey: What -- do you think you'll move back towards the its -- say your crude stays at 50 bucks and we stay at 3.50 nat gas, would you expect your finances to get back in cash balance towards the end of the year allowing for your expected cost savings? Or you think this would still be a debt increase year for the remainder?\nPatricia Yarrington: I think it's a more likely than not that there would be a modest increase in the debt over the course of the year. But I will have to caution that that it's highly dependent on the cost structure changes that we see coming forward in the last three quarters of the year. I don't think you've seen the you've seen the beginning of that but we expect that to accelerate in the remaining three quarters.\nPaul Sankey: Is there any reason to specific to volumes to think that your 7% number. You mentioned I believe that the implied decline rate you had was 2% for Q1, but you expect it to hit 7%, I guess as a full year number. Which means you're going to go to, by the end of the year beyond 7% decline; if I'm thinking straight and how much variation is there around that element?\nJames Aleveras: Paul, that would obviously hurt cash flows a little bit, but offsetting them is the ramp up of major capital projects. So if you look at our full year production profile you wouldn't really see a decline or the base decline being as big a factor in total as you would if you just look that at it in isolation.\nPaul Sankey: Yeah. I get that because you've given us a full year volume...\nPatricia Yarrington: That's right.\nPaul Sankey: Expectation (ph) which includes that right?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes. That's correct. 2.63 million barrels of oil equivalent what we're expecting for the full year.\nPaul Sankey: So effectively the major uncertainty is regarding the cash balance not the volumes as far as you are concerned, regardless of what you tell about decline rates accelerating?\nJames Aleveras: The decline rates wouldn't be a big impact on cash simply because...\nPatricia Yarrington: It's offset.\nJames Aleveras: It's offset by growth in major capital projects.\nPaul Sankey: No. what I meant is the uncertainties surrounding the costs that you're going to have to pay is a greater uncertainty than the volume uncertainty?\nJames Aleveras: At this point, yes.\nPaul Sankey: Yeah. I've got you. If I could and I don't think you're going be happy with me for asking this question, but it's a question I'm being asked a lot. Can you just got through the timing on the Ecuador decision. What the potential risk is there to the company and to shareholders? Thanks.\nPatricia Yarrington: No, sure it's a very topical question so I can understand why you want to ask the question. First of all let me get the facts out as we see them here, we don't think the lawsuit has any legal or factual merit we did complete -- Texaco did complete a $40 million remediation program and the Ecuadorian government signed off on that that the sites were properly, remediated and they granted Texaco a full release from this liability. The evidence that we have suggest that the remediation was properly conducted and the remaining environmental claims and damage really are the responsibility of Petroecuador. It is possible that we could see a judgment come down any day now, I wish could be more specific about the timing but, I don't think it's necessarily immune from political influences as to when that timing will occur. But it could be any day; it could also be several months from now. We will appeal that judgment, whatever it turns out to be and we have courses of appeal to a sort of a panel of judges in the superior quarter of Lago Agrio and if necessary then all the way up to the Supreme Court of Ecuador. So I think that you could expect that this litigation aspect of this suit can go on for quite sometime. I don't think that there is merit in the case and we have a very strong legal as well as scientific data behind that. So from a shareholder perspective I think it's interesting to pay attention too certainly and be on top of it, but I don't see that there is financial impact coming as a result of this; significant financial impact coming as a result to this.\nPaul Sankey: But, the judgment could be -- the number seems to be $27 billion?\nPatricia Yarrington: Well. That is what the court appointed so called expert has laid out there, but there really is not much factual data behind the 27 billion nor is the individual an expert in any sense relative to the task he's been asked to do.\nPaul Sankey: Yeah I guess okay, so I think I understand that what you are saying is we are not sure. There could be a decision any day. It is likely to be a very big number and you'll automatically appeal it which will then extend the process essentially for, probably years?\nPatricia Yarrington: That's exactly right. And we think that the large number that's being bantered around is really very politically driven.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. Thank you. I leave at that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Kessler with Simmons & Company.\nRobert Kessler: Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions for me on the, one on the downstream timing effects; I know you've taken steps to reduce the volatility of the downstream earnings eliminating the preferentially priced foreign crude deliveries to U.S. and what not. I still saw some timing effects in the quarter though. I'm curious if you have any rough expectation going forward as opposed to a significant negative correlation between timing effects and movements in crude prices? Should we just model zero benefit or detriment going forward regardless of what crude prices do, or do you have any rough indication on the order of magnitude and direction going forward there? And then just a quick question on the -- any benefits in the downstream associated with the Contango ship (ph) that the crude stripped (ph) over the course of the first quarter? Thanks.\nJames Aleveras: Robert let me just address those two real quickly for you here. In the U.S. downstream we pretty much wrung out a lot of the impacts as we have talked about in prior quarters. So the provisional price (ph) foreign crude is going to be pretty -- very-very minor only on some minor contracts that aren't necessarily ratable like our major ones. And there would be from time-to-time some derivative activity only if we get outside of a typical band. So I'd say that for purposes of looking forward the timing effects should be in the U.S. downstream, fairly minor and not something that I would internally project to be significant. Now in the international downstream, we still use as I've described in past quarters derivatives to lock in margins on long haul crude sales from the partition neutral zone as well as long haul product sales from our Pembroke refinery in the UK which is an export refinery. This is where we sell the product on a deliberate basis. It's priced in a deliberate basis but the buyer takes the title. So effectively we're selling it FOB. So we do use derivatives to lock in margins on those sales. So in the international downstream you will see a modest timing effect that will be related in virtually to product and crude prices on a going forward basis. But again it should be more modest than what we've seen in the past, but not as significantly reduced as in the U.S.\nRobert Kessler: Okay. Thanks.\nJames Aleveras: Is that helpful?\nRobert Kessler: It does. Thanks.\nJames Aleveras: Now you had a second question...\nPatricia Yarrington: On the Contango (ph).\nJames Aleveras: That really isn't a great big factor for us. Our trading activities compared to some of our competitors is much smaller in overall size.\nRobert Kessler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Mielke with Merrill Lynch.\nErik Mielke: Hi good morning. I have question on your production guidance for 2009. Would it be fair to say that that's looking increasingly conservative, given the pace of development and the ramp up at the various major capital projects that you have coming on in 2009?\nPatricia Yarrington: I think it is the number that we want to standby at this particular point in time. I mean, the one thing that you'll recall I mean I think we feel very confident about our ability to execute on these major capital projects and to have the profile that we outlined back in March. The one area that's slightly different this first quarter than what we had expected was that we had expected in putting that forecast together earlier on, that there would be demand curtailment, OpEx on one hand but also market forces on the other for pipeline gas particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. We haven't seen that through the first quarter, from Chevron standpoint and so we've got an uptick there. I think that really depends going forward on our ability to supply those markets versus some of the competitions ability to supply some of those Asian gas markets.\nErik Mielke: Okay. That's useful. Can I ask it specifically on Tengiz, there was a story in one of the interesting journals a couple of weeks back, that TCO is looking at a potential boost to production from existing capacity, from existing synergies this summer. Is there any creditability to that story, the numbers were not immaterial?\nPatricia Yarrington: Right no, I actually saw that as well and all I can tell you is that we do expect to hit full capacity in the second half of the year. Ramp up is continuing there.\nErik Mielke: Okay, thanks I'll leave with that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Flannery with Credit Suisse.\nMark Flannery: Hi, sort of got two questions. One on cost; on slide 12 when you say you're targeting both operating expenses and capital expenses, can you give us an idea of what you're target is? In other words, are you going for 5% reduction over the full year or 10% reduction or other things being equal, just give us a sense of where do you think you can get to?\nPatricia Yarrington: Mark, I don't have a target that I want to give you. I think I tried to explain before about how we're going after it, how it's different by cost category, how the ramp up period depends on -- it's going to be very sequential over the remaining months of the year. So I don't have a particular target. I will say that we're down 8%, quarter -- first quarter over first quarter on the SG&A and Op expense line and we do expect that to accelerate. So I would expect that pattern to continue to improve as the year progresses. But I don't have a specific percentage target to layout for you. We do have -- I will say we do have line-by-line items in our business units and in our staff group about cost reductions, opportunities and commitments that are being made, all around the globe. So there is huge effort in the company and huge specificity in the company about what those opportunities for cash conservation are.\nMark Flannery: Okay.\nPatricia Yarrington: And we we'll track them and expect them to be realized.\nMark Flannery: Okay. Maybe I could then shift over to the dividend. You kept the dividend flat this quarter. Do you intent to grow the dividend this year or how should we think about the progress of dividend payments in the lower part of the cycle?\nPatricia Yarrington: Right, it's a good question Mark. We do have a strong history of dividend growth. We've been having increasing payments in each of the last 21 years. The dividends so I -- are by the Board and I don't, in any way want to step in front of that call. But we do know that dividends are priority for our shareholders. We did hold it flat in the second quarter here and we got competitive deals and competitive payouts. But we think holding it flat was sort of consistent with and prudent in uncertain economic environment that we're in the low commodity prices. All I can tell you is that the Board will look at this every quarter. And we're proud of the record that we've had. We understand the prioritization and they will move it when they feel that it's a prudent course of action when it comes.\nMark Flannery: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Howard Weil.\nDoug Leggate: Good morning Pat and Jim.\nPatricia Yarrington: Good morning.\nJames Aleveras: Hi, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: Hi guys. My question -- I'm going to start off with DD&A. It's up about 30% year-over-year. I know though obviously there has been some new projects come on line, but can you just walk us through why such a significant move and may be split the international upstream and the U.S. upstream out of that number, so we can get an idea of what's going on there, any clarity on that would be helpful?\nJames Aleveras: But Doug, I don't have the details in front of me. The increase in DD&A is partly related to accretion expense and to a number of other things that you see in the first quarter when we do a DD&A rate review. And we also have a situation where there are lot of impairments and charges that run through the DD&A line when they are taken, such that they are more or less discreet items and they tend to distort what people perceive as DD&A being a flat thing which would be the case in a in an industry that didn't have unit of production DD&A. I don't see the trend being dramatically different, I look at that DD&A rates and the impact of rates which have changed just a little bit but, they are not that dramatic. Instead what you are seeing in the year-over-year comparison is more or less the impact of the discrete items going back to what I was talking to Mark Gilman about in response to his question, the fact that we take for example, some unproved property write-downs those hit the DD&A line. So that can be a little misleading in periods when we're taking charges of unproved properties and other things that tend to run through DD&A, they're shown there but that's not a reflection of the underlying depreciation and depletion that would be ongoing.\nDoug Leggate: So, Jim just may be you can spell it out for me then, what is the if your DD&A this quarter was 2.87 billion, so we're up about 600 and change over last -- over Q1 last year and up about 300 from Q4. What would you define then as the clean underlying DD&A, in other words what should our run rate be going forward because that's heck of a move?\nJames Aleveras: Very-very good question and one I'm a little...\nPatricia Yarrington: It also relates to higher volumes in the quarter as well though.\nDoug Leggate: Yeah. Right.\nPatricia Yarrington: The absolute number -- the absolute number you just quoted relates to absolute volumes as well.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. So production was up 2.5% but DD&A was up 30%?\nJames Aleveras: I would need to break out the components of that, I don't have the pieces in front of me. We'll be prepared to address that question in more detail and I think you'll have a better basis of comparison next quarter when we're comparing six months to six months.\nDoug Leggate: Okay so generally...\nJames Aleveras: But I'll make sure I have those pieces in front of me on the next call.\nDoug Leggate: All right thank you, I don't want to labor (ph) the point but what I'm reading from what you are saying then is you would expect that DD&A absolute number to come down quite a bit in second quarter. Is that a fair interpretation?\nJames Aleveras: I would expect six months of 2009 to be not dramatically different from six months of 2008 adjusting for the factors that Pat mentioned such as, as volumes and so forth.\nDoug Leggate: That's sounds pretty clear.\nJames Aleveras: And we would have to then look then at what the discrete items hitting DD&A were in each year; both credits and debits and pull those out and I'll be prepared that next quarter on a six month basis.\nDoug Leggate: Great, thank you. My follow-up if I may is, still got a decent amount of productions shut in the Gulf of Mexico. Something you don't talk about any or not recently has been the ongoing semi-permanent shuts in Nigeria. Can you just give us an update on what you expect the -- as your best guess anyway the likely timing of any recovery in Gulf or for that matter in Nigeria, or in any others that I've missed in my question?\nJames Aleveras: Well, let me address the timing in the Gulf first. That we're running a little slower than what we had been projecting in terms of restoration. We're basically right now where we had hoped to be at the beginning of the year. And that's really a function of things that are not under our control, such as the recovery of third party gathering alliance pipelines and processing facilities. What we should be looking for in Nigeria is probably something more or less similar in the future with the increase in Agbami being the big swing. But we don't see any significant production disruptions in Nigeria. Obviously there are parts of Nigeria where we have production that we probably aren't going to be bringing back on line in the near-term. But on the other hand, the onshore Nigeria is not a big contributor to our earnings.\nDoug Leggate: Got it I understand. Forgive me, if I could jump right very quickly to the DD&A question, it might be related or might be me squeezing in the third question here, but the two...\nJames Aleveras: We're no longer limiting questions expect to a prudent few. But it's no longer one per.\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate that. Well the $2 billion concession extension, where was that -- was it any reserve additions associated with that? And is that maybe part of the DD&A explanation and that's it for me. Thanks.\nJames Aleveras: I don't believe it will be part of the DD&A explanation. I would be unable to tell you where it occurred. We described in our CNE press release what the two onetime bonuses were; this is the larger of the two hitting. But because of contractual commitments we can't be more specific than that.\nPatricia Yarrington: You know what Doug, just as a final thought I'd ask you, I know you're focused on DD&A here but I'd ask you to go back and pull up the slide that we showed in the March analyst meeting where we talked about our advantage downstream cost structure which takes into account the DD&A as well as production operating costs et cetera. And you can see we're very competitive on that. So DD&A is one component of the cost structure, but certainly there's other things that going into that and from a competitive standpoint we looked very good.\nDoug Leggate: Okay thanks Pat.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Levin with Levin Capital.\nJohn Levin: Could you outline the Jack Malo fuel in the Gulf sort of both the economics and the size, there've been various estimates on it. Could just help to find that, your best estimates at the moment please?\nPatricia Yarrington: Well I think, we have said that we're in the process of entering feed. The production capacity is expected to be between a 120 and 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. George talked in our analyst meeting about the need to have significantly sized opportunities here and that you need a reasonably large sized reservoirs that will have a long lifed production profile to them.\nJohn Levin: Right and what economics is sort of baseline price you need to have a margin of safety?\nPatricia Yarrington: You know I think it's really hard for us to say at this particular point in time, we're just entering feed, the cost structure is very much influx. Obviously we feel comfortable going forward at this stage, into feed with this project. We'll have a much better idea once we get information from that part of our project management process done with.\nJohn Levin: And when would that be...?\nPatricia Yarrington: As far as I can say.\nJohn Levin: When would that be you think, in timing?\nPatricia Yarrington: I think that's probably 12 to 18 months.\nJohn Levin: Got you, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Gilman with Benchmark\nMark Gilman: I wonder if I could talk or you guys to talk a little bit more about the foreign downstream numbers. If we add back Jim the 140 million in timing differences, it takes that number on an adjusted basis, if my math is correct which might a leap of faith, up to nearly $500 billion. Which I guess in my mind, in light of the environment in light of the very weak shipping earnings components which I'm sure is in there, very weak or in chemicals component which I know is in there. It just seems very-very strong in the context of the environment. Are there other drivers associated with that?\nJames Aleveras: No there aren't Mark. I think you have to look at the impact in the international downstream obviously we had assets sales this quarter.\nMark Gilman: Yeah, I've taken that out?\nJames Aleveras: Right. If you pull that out and look at the operations that's pretty much a baseline result. There wasn't a whole lot of unusual noise there. Obviously we were running our refineries very well. We moved a lot of product. But there wasn't anything there that was in the first quarter that I can point to that was very unusual.\nMark Gilman: No LIFO or inventory effects?\nJames Aleveras: Not significant.\nPatricia Yarrington: Yeah. And continued emphasis on operating expense reductions.\nMark Gilman: Okay. Guys, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein.\nNeil McMahon: Hi, just a few that probably haven't been covered yet. First of all, just looking at olefins, can you give us your cash breakeven for your olefin operations? And obviously with your portfolio which has expanded pretty rapidly over the last few years there. And what are your views specifically on the cost of developing that asset base up in Canada?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yeah. I think we should leave the cash breakeven question to the operator. But as what we've seen across all development opportunities here, the cost structure is moving down. I would also say that the light heavy differential probably moved in terms of favor for a tar sands olefins type of opportunity here in the first quarter. That's not good for other parts of our business. But I think it was appropriately positive for the olefins activity. Does that address your question, but I'm really -- I really think we need to leave it to the operator to address the cash breakeven. Tremendous emphasis on cost containment, cost structure improvements that are going on there; we're not going to go forward, the joint venture has decided not to expand on the second phase of that. And so the efforts to-date are really on improving the cost structure and the reliability of the operation that we currently have.\nNeil McMahon: So I am presuming like Shell and Myers (ph) you also met a loss in that business in the first quarter?\nJames Aleveras: Yeah. I think it's important to understand that we have a 20% non-operated interest in the Athabasca project. And we aren't going to disclose the financial results; we're going to see those in the international upstream segment. But you make a reasonable assumption about that given the prices.\nNeil McMahon: Just may be on your you've talk a bit about dividends maybe just switching to buybacks, one of your larger peers made a reduction in their buyback guidance yesterday. Just looking at yours going forward what could you say for the rest of this year in terms of buybacks and what would trigger you to go either plus or negatives on the buybacks going forward?\nPatricia Yarrington: We suspended our share buyback program for the first quarter and we're not continuing it in the second quarter. And I think if you've got commodity, price conditions as we have currently; I think it would be unlikely that we would reinstate that share repurchase program for 2009. We do have a strong capital program and so that's where our priority really is. We've already talked about the dividend, that's a priority as well. And so we look at the share repurchase program as being the most discretionary element of our cash use.\nNeil McMahon: Given that decision which was made when you're looking forward, do you have a particular -- having run the financials in your business, do you have a particular oil price that or a blended oil and gas price that it seems to make sense where your generating enough cash to step out or to go back into the buybacks again?\nPatricia Yarrington: I don't think I want to go down that path with you there. I think you just need to -- on your own set of models; with your own set of commodity prices and all production growth increases that we've outlined, capital program that we've outlined; I think come up with your own estimates on that. I just need to reemphasize that the share repurchases come after the dividend and they come after the capital program and our capital program we've got a long queue of projects here, a lot of opportunities for organic development that are important to us and that are legacy building assets and that's really where our prioritization is.\nNeil McMahon: But maybe just to summarize this, well if your, your self (ph) not in control looking forward of the financial situation what is -- the philosophy hasn't changed then in terms of what it had been over the last few years in terms of priority?\nPatricia Yarrington: No, in fact the philosophy has not changed. I mean we put a high priority on maintaining financial strength and flexibility, maintaining our double A rating, funding our projects and paying sustained and growing dividend that's really our priority.\nNeil McMahon: Okay so...\nPatricia Yarrington: And that hasn't changed and I think you saw going back to the analyst meeting, I put up a chart that talked to -- what we have done, how we have managed our balance sheet over through thick and thin times from commodity price cycle standpoint.\nNeil McMahon: Okay.\nPatricia Yarrington: So I think our posture has been very consistent.\nNeil McMahon: May be just a very quick last one, anything any update on interest Iraq?\nPatricia Yarrington: Obviously we are interested in Iraq, it could have -- could turn out to be a real opportunity for us. But that depends really on the terms and conditions. The Iraqi's did just put out new kind of bid around terms. We're in a process of evaluating those. We do believe that they have made some improvements. But I don't want to comment any further than that. We know the bids were due and that they will be opened up at the end of June, I believe it is. And so we'll wait and see what comes of that. But obviously it's a prospective area. But it really will depend on the fiscal terms that are to be realized.\nNeil McMahon: Okay. Thank you.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay. I think that -- pretty much -- we have one more question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.\nPaul Cheng: Hey guys, I will be real quick. Jim, if I look at page nine, in the international downstream you have other policy of 143 million of the benefit. And you are saying that it was trading profit. To assume -- if I looked at and also foreign exchange I suppose. So if I look at that it seems to suggest your trading profit is roughly about 118 million for the quarter, is that on the ballpark, correct? And secondly on the DD&A increase sequentially from the fourth quarter are they all in the upstream or that some of them you see in the downstream also?\nJames Aleveras: Okay. Let's take that one other time. We are talking international downstream other and what I said there was we had tax items and trading profits, made up the majority with foreign currency effects offsetting. So in order of size, favorable tax items relative to the fourth quarter were the largest in that swing. Trading profits for next and of course foreign currency is what you see in terms of the 84 million adverse change.\nPaul Cheng: So the tax item is a bigger impact than the trading profit?\nJames Aleveras: Yeah. I always give you the impact in the order of size.\nPaul Cheng: I see. And can you -- seems that some of your competitors like Shell and BP they make a huge killing in the first quarter from trading. Any kind of rough number you may be able to share?\nJames Aleveras: No. Again we did not make a huge killing simply because we don't have large trading activities from book. The trading and derivatives that I talk about in conjunction with the downstream are used to lock in margins. We don't use hedge accounting, so we talk about them as derivatives, but they really are meant to be risk management tools. So trading for our own book relative to some of our competitors is very small. One of our larger competitors does virtually none. So we're pretty small in terms of trading for own book.\nPaul Cheng: Okay.\nPatricia Yarrington: Except that I mean, we did see the commercial opportunity and we did have some positives associated with the Contango market. But it's much more modest than what you might have been reading on the part of others.\nPaul Cheng: Okay, fair. How about DD&A?\nJames Aleveras: DD&A was not a big factor here I mentioned\nPaul Cheng: No, I was saying that DD&A increased, is it all the its close to 300 million, is it all related to the upstream or they're just in downstream or chemical or corporate debt (ph), also have?\nJames Aleveras: No I mentioned it in the context of the U.S upstream. The impact in the international downstream was not as significant in terms of quarter-over-quarter change.\nPaul Cheng: Okay, would do. Thank you.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay. That...\nJames Aleveras: All right that's the end of the call.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay, so in closing let me say that we appreciate everyone's participation in today's call. I certainly want to thank each of the analysts on behalf of all the participants for their questions during the morning session. We do appreciate your interest in our company and we hope you share our enthusiasm. Our projects are ramping up well or executing well, we're on plan. We're operating very well. We are aggressively managing our spend, whether that's OpEx or CapEx. And we feel that we've got the flexibility to manage well in this environment, to achieve low unit costs, grow the business and put up very competitive returns. So thank you all. Sean, I'll turn it back to you.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes Chevron's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}], "2011": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2010, "date": "2011-01-28 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Shawn, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corp., Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.\nJohn Watson: Okay. Thanks, Shawn. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our CFO; and Jeanette Ourada, the General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2010, and we will refer to the slides that are available on our website. Of course, before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements, and we ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I'd like to share some of our strategic accomplishments for 2010, which are located on Slide 3. I'll begin with our safety performance. This past year, we achieved our safest year ever, again, I might add, our safest year ever with both our Upstream and Downstream operations setting new records. We're very proud of our world-class safety performance, and it will continue to underpin everything we do. In the Upstream, our achievements were many. We exceeded our production growth guidance, delivering 2% growth for the year. We progressed a number of key projects. We sanctioned three Deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico, along with the Papa-Terra project in Brazil. We also sanctioned the expansion of the Caspian Pipeline, a critical step forward for our next Tengiz expansion in Kazakhstan. We continued our Australian exploration success with five discoveries. This brings us to a total of nine discoveries since we sanctioned Gorgon 18 months ago. These additional volumes will support expansion opportunities at both Gorgon and Wheatstone. Finally, we added a significant amount of new Deepwater and shale acreage to our portfolio. We're currently in the early phases of evaluating and planning for these new opportunities. Looking at our Downstream business, we made truly great progress in the first year of a three-year plan to improve returns. A new organization is now in place and focused on tactical plans to improve performance. In 2010, we sold the Colonial Pipeline, exited seven countries and most U.S. East Coast markets. We received good value for these assets. These exits lower costs and capital employed in the Downstream, allowing us to focus on markets of competitive strength. We also made progress on our capital projects with start-ups in the U.S., Korea and Qatar. In all 2010 was an excellent year, both operationally and financially. Pat will now take you through our fourth quarter financial results. So I'll turn it over to Pat.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay. Thanks, John. Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter earnings were $5.3 billion or $2.64 per diluted share. Comparing the fourth quarter 2010 to the same quarter a year earlier, our earnings were up over 70%. Upstream benefited from higher prices and sales volumes, and Downstream benefited from higher refined product and chemical margins and asset sales. For the year, earnings were $19 billion or $9.48 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the year was over 17%, and our debt ratio at year end was 9.8%. We paid $5.7 billion in dividends, and 2010 marked the 23rd consecutive annual dividend increase, with an annual average growth rate over the period of 7%. In the fourth quarter, we resumed our common stock repurchase program, repurchasing $750 million of our shares. In the first quarter of 2011, we expect to repurchase another $750 million. Finally, Chevron's 2010 TSR, total shareholder return, was nearly 23%. Over a five-year period, we continue to hold the number one ranking in our peer group and have outpaced the S&P 500 by over 10%. Now on Slide 5, underscoring Chevron's financial strength, our cash balances exceeded debt by $5.6 billion at the end of the year. In the fourth quarter, cash from operations exceeded $8 billion. For the full year, cash from operations exceeded $31 billion, a record for the company. And this is after nearly $1.5 billion in pension contributions. Along with proceeds from our assets and divestments, our cash flow provided excellent support for our capital expenditures, our dividend payments and our share buyback program. Our previous investments are generating strong earnings and cash flow, allowing us to reinvest in our project queue, while sustaining meaningful dividend growth and a share buyback program. Certainly, our strong cash flows and our solid balance sheet continue to be a competitive advantage. Turning to Slide 6. I'll compare results of the fourth quarter 2010 with the third quarter of 2010. And as a reminder, our earnings release compares fourth quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter earnings were $1.5 billion, higher than the third quarter. Results for all of the segments improved between periods. Upstream earnings were up nearly $1.3 billion, driven by higher oil prices and higher liftings. Downstream results were nearly $200 million higher. Gains on asset sales and favorable timing effects were partly offset by higher operating expenses. The variance in the other bar reflects the favorable swing in corporate tax items. On Slide 7. Our U.S. Upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were $16 million lower than the third quarter's results. Realizations increased earnings by $180 million. U.S. crude realizations rose over $7 per barrel between consecutive quarters, about $1 less than the increase in the average spot price of our WTI. Natural gas realizations fell between quarters, in line with Henry Hub spot prices, offsetting about $30 million of the liquids realization benefit. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $30 million between periods, primarily due to higher maintenance costs associated with multiple assets. Inventory effects had a $60 million unfavorable impact between quarters, primarily due to year-end LIFO drawdowns. And the other bar is comprised of a number of unrelated items, including higher abandonment expenses and lower gas marketing earnings. Now on Slide 8. International Upstream earnings were up $1.3 billion compared with the third quarter. Higher oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $600 million. Average liquid realizations rose 14% between quarters, slightly higher than the increase in average rent spot prices. Natural gas realizations increased 2% between quarters. Higher lifting, particularly in Kazakhstan and Indonesia, increased earnings nearly $400 million. Operating expenses decreased earnings by $120 million. About half of that total was due to a new Indonesian agreement, where we sell oil and purchase natural gas. Previously, we had handled this through a volume exchange. And with the new arrangement, the natural gas purchased shows up in operating expense. With an identical offset in liftings from the oil sale, there is no bottom line earnings impact and no impact on production. As a result of this new agreement, we expect the 2011 full year increase in reported operating expense to be approximately $1 billion. Moving to the next bar, a favorable change in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $190 million. The fourth quarter had a small loss of about $50 million compared to a $250 million loss in the third quarter. These foreign exchange impacts have no direct effect on cash. They are primarily balance sheet translation effects. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including lower tax, exploration and depreciation expenses. Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Production increased 48,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts during the current quarter, decreasing production about 18,000 barrels a day. The average WTI spot price increased about $9 between quarters. For the fourth quarter, each dollar increase in WTI resulted in a 2,000 barrel a day volume reduction. Base business production increased 32,000 barrels a day between quarters. It is unusual to see a positive variance for this bar. The absence of third quarter planned turnarounds in Europe and Karachaganak more than offset normal Base business declines and planned maintenance in Thailand. Contributions from major capital projects increased fourth quarter production by 34,000 barrels a day, primarily driven by the ramp up of the AOSP [Athabasca Oil Sands Project] expansion in Canada and higher volumes in the Gulf of Mexico. Slide 10 compares full-year 2010 net oil-equivalent production to that of 2009. Production rose 2% or 59,000 barrels a day. On a price-adjusted basis, we achieved a 3% production increase in 2010. Price impacts from production sharing and variable royalty contracts decreased production by 38,000 barrels a day. The average WTI price increased about $18 in 2010. And for the full year then, each dollar increase in WTI resulted in about a 2,000 barrel per day volume reduction. Base business combined with external constraints lowered production by 73,000 barrels a day. Record Base business reliability and system optimizations limited our decline rate to about 4%, in line with the guidance we provided earlier in the year. Also included in this bar are the favorable production benefits from fewer security disruptions in Nigeria and higher natural gas demand in Asia. Incremental production from our major capital projects contributed 173,000 barrels a day to 2010 oil and gas production, reflecting debottlenecking at Tengiz, SGI/SGP in Kazakhstan and a full year of production from Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico and Frade in Brazil. Now on Slide 11. Compared to the third quarter, U.S. Downstream earnings improved $126 million in the fourth quarter. Indicator margins reduced earnings by $85 million. We saw a stronger Gulf Coast refining indicator margin, in part driven by seasonal heating demand. However, West Coast margins fell by 11%, reflecting the end of peak driving season and high inventory levels. Marketing indicator margins continued to weaken in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter turnaround activities were also a major driver in the quarter of negative $140 million earnings impact. This came about because of lower volumes and higher operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, we sold our interest in the Colonial Pipeline Co. and in seven terminals, realizing a combined gain of nearly $400 million. The other bar consists of several unrelated items, including lower trading and Chemicals results, offset by lower turnaround-related feed stock costs. On Slide 12. International Downstream earnings were also higher, increasing $51 million from third quarter's results. Weakened Asian refining and marketing margins lowered earnings by $35 million. Operating expenses increased between quarters negatively impacting earnings by $90 million, reflecting small increases across a number of multiple expense categories. Timing effects represented $120 million positive variance between the quarters, reflecting a swing from a negative $85 million in the third quarter to a positive $35 million in the fourth quarter. The primary drivers were favorable year-end LIFO effects and lower volumes of open paper associated with underlying physical positions. Put another way, we simply had fewer cargoes and, therefore, less paper exposed to the higher prices. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $65 million. Fourth quarter's foreign exchange loss was about $55 million compared to the third quarter loss of $120 million. And the other bar there includes a number of offsetting items. Now on Slide 13. Fourth quarter net charges were $294 million compared to a net of $361 million charge in the third quarter, a decrease of $67 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in $150 million benefit to earnings. Corporate charges were $83 million higher in the fourth quarter. For the full year, this segment had net charges of $1.1 billion. We believe our quarterly guidance range of between $250 million and $350 million for net charges in this All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. And so with that, I'd like to now turn it back over to John for a few thoughts on 2011.\nJohn Watson: Okay. Thanks, Pat. Let's turn to Slide 14. We recently announced our capital program for 2011 at $26 billion. This is about a 20% increase from our 2010 investment of $22 billion. 85% of the program is for Upstream activities, primarily related to our large multiyear projects and consistent with our well-articulated Upstream growth strategies. These include our legacy LNG projects in Western Australia and projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Africa and the Gulf of Thailand. About 11% of the planned investment is earmarked for Downstream, mostly related to maintenance and capital projects at our larger refineries. As Pat mentioned earlier, we grew production over 2% in 2010 and exceeded both our original and interim guidance despite higher crude prices. Slide 11 shows our production outlook for 2011. Our full year outlook for production in 2011 is 2.79 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, about a 1% increase over 2010 levels. The outlook assumes $79 per barrel, the same average price as 2010 and does not assume OPEC curtailments, material security or market impacts. The 1% increase comes from a combination of sustained performance from our base business and continued ramp-ups from some major capital projects. Turning to Slide 16. Heading into 2011, our strategies remain very consistent and are serving our shareholders well, we believe. In the Upstream, we're on track for start-up of two major capital projects, the Platong II project in Thailand and the Agbami 2 project in Nigeria. We expect to sanction three other major capital projects, the Wheatstone LNG project in Australia, the Vietnam Block B gas project and the Clair Ridge project in the U.K. We will continue to progress our major capital projects with keen focus on Gorgon and our Deep Water Gulf of Mexico projects. During the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Atlas Energy. We look forward to the results from the Atlas stockholders meeting on February 16. We're currently working on integration planning. We look forward to welcoming this highly skilled team to Chevron's family and adding these assets to our portfolio. In the Downstream, we will continue on our path to improve returns and building on the solid foundation that we achieved in 2010. We expect to complete a number of divestitures and market exits consistent with our strategy to focus on Downstream operations, where we have competitive strengths. We also expect to sanction our Pascagoula Base Oil project shortly and start up our Saudi JV chemical project this year. Underlying all of our efforts will be a continued focus on safe, reliable operations, project execution, capital discipline and cost structure vigilance. 2011 will be another year where we continue our disciplined growth, continue maintaining our financial strength and continue to reward our stockholders, and we look forward to further discussing our plans at our Security Analyst Meeting on March 14 in New York City. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now welcome your questions. So Shawn, please open the lines for those questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nEdward Westlake: Firstly, as you look at your portfolio, I mean, housecleaning's always a good practice. What kind of level of disposals are you thinking for 2011?\nJohn Watson: Sure, Ed. In terms of divestitures, most of the efforts that you'll see in 2011 are really following up on the work we've been doing in the Downstream area. We have been pruning our portfolio, chiefly, of marketing assets that aren't directly linked or supplied through our refining networks. So we've announced a series of sales, and those will continue. In addition, we've made no secret of the fact that we were going to test the market around our U.K. Refining and Marketing business. And as Mike Wirth mentioned to you in the third quarter call, we've had considerable interest. And so, we've said that we'll dispose of those assets if we get a fair value. I don't have anything to talk about specifically today, other than to say that we have had a very strong interest in those assets. And so, we'll be continuing to work that opportunity. Beyond that, most of the divestitures that you see in the Upstream tend to be routine disposals for assets that are at the end of their useful life. Our general view is absent a very compelling strategic move. There's a lot of leakage when you sell Upstream assets through tax consequences and other. And so we tend to make decisions for the long term, but I think you could see some pruning that would be sort of in the ordinary course of business.\nEdward Westlake: I mean, obviously, you're positive on the U.S. gas demands and the position you picked up in the Atlas, and frac-ing is also helping to unlock some of the onshore oil potential in North America and elsewhere. I mean, you've got strong sort of international exploration credentials and cash flow per barrel. What's stopping you, I guess, being more assertive, given the cash you've got on the balance sheet in the nonconventional area, maybe thought for your plans?\nJohn Watson: Well, we talked about unconventional last year at our meeting in New York, we had indicated that we thought the price prices were, frankly, a bit high at that time, and that we have had a fairly active interest in shale gas properties. And so, we have been accumulating opportunities overseas. We've done so in Poland and Romania and Canada, and we have said we that we were looking in the United States, too. We haven't seen the value proposition. Well, as we progress through the year, we saw values improve. And so, we did make what we think is a good offer for Atlas Energy. And that's the kind of low-cost entry that we're looking to make. Now our first order of business is to close that transaction, and we look forward to the shareholders' vote next month. Having said that, we're in the business of acquiring assets. We do so through leases. We do so through discovered resources, and we do so through companies periodically. And so that effort will continue, including in shale areas, if we see the right commercial opportunities. We try to either be ahead of the game, so that we get low-cost entries or we try to wait for the right opportunity, given market effects for discovered resource or companies, as the case may be.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.\nDouglas Terreson: John, my question is on the Upstream. Globally, your production growth was impressive in 2010 when you consider that your output in whatever is in 4% before prices effects, and that it did rise by 2% with price effects. And that's after the 7% gain in 2009. And as you pointed out both of these numbers were well ahead of expectations. And so, I want to see why you believe the Upstream segment has been able to consistently surpass expectations in recent years, meaning, for the past couple of years, price effects were kind of a neutral factor, which implies that external effects, stronger base business and/or better performance on new projects drove the surprise in relation to expectations. And so, I just wanted to see if you could provide any additional insight into some of the things that might be driving this performance?\nJohn Watson: I think we have had a very good run, as you point out. Actually over the last five years, we hit the target that we laid out for the financial community for production growth, and we recognize that that's helped our credibility. And we're focused on doing the same thing again. In terms of why that's happened, I think it's a combination of things. I think I'd start with the people and the leadership that we've got. George Kirkland and his leadership team are simply terrific and do a great job. They're supported by a technology organization, a project execution organization, that works very well. Our business model has strong leaders on the ground, supported by functional groups. And we think that, that works very well. Now it helps to have good assets in our portfolio, and of course, we think we have those as well. You saw that we had some nice gains in Kazakhstan, the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere last year. The final thing, maybe one other thing I would mention, is we talk a lot about our base business work that isn't quite as glamorous as perhaps some of the major capital projects. But the blocking and tackling around well reliability, maintenance, facilities, debottlenecking, et cetera has really been outstanding, and that initiative really moved forward in the middle part of this last decade. And George and his team was supported, many throughout the organization have just done an outstanding job. And I give them a lot of credit for the work that's going on. And we have really made progress by production efficiency or other internal measures that we use to track that, and we're looking forward to sustaining and finding new ways to do even better. But those would be the things that I'd highlight.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: A question on reserve bookings, and I know that it has been and will remain lumpy, and we should see a significant impact in 2011, when Wheatstone reaches FID. But I was wondering if you could give some color on the bookings and whether you booked anything on the gone projects that were sanctioned D D, Big Foot and Jack/St. Malo and whether those bookings were influenced by either inactivity or SEC technical definitions, particularly regarding Jack.\nJohn Watson: Yes, that's a good question on this technical subject. I think that your premise is pretty good. The previous five years, we had more than replaced reserves, and it is lumpy and it's a function of a couple of things. It's a function primarily of major capital project timing. I mean, there are price effects. So our reserve replacement rate was 24%. It would have been something like 37% without price effects. But beyond that, it's really the timing of major capital project bookings. Now if you go back some years, it was quite common that when you went to FID, you had major bookings. In this instance, we had three Deepwater developments: Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot in the Gulf of Mexico and Papa-Terra in Brazil that, based on the economics that we run that sanctioned the projects. And remember, these projects are shares of about $8 billion. So we felt confident enough in the resource that was there that it would be recoverable to make those investments. But the volumes that we premised those projects on, which are close to 600 million barrels, we didn't book any of them. And we didn't book them for the reason that you described. There's an economic producability test that the SEC has, under our interpretation of the rules, that, first, you start with the technical qualifications for what can be booked early. And typically, that limits the number of barrels, and then those barrels alone are not what you ultimately expect to recover. You have to cover all the capital costs, which may include infrastructure for future expansions and the like. And so you get into this situation where you have to get enough, some costs behind you, before you can book the reserves. And that's just the SEC rules, and we live by them, but we think it contributes to the lumpiness that you described. And you can go back over the last 10 years, and we've had periods that were low and periods that were very high. And this happened to be a low year, but it's not impacted by the moratorium. I'm saying it's more impacted by the SEC rules. And as you say, as we press forward with these, we'll expect to record bookings in future years.\nEvan Calio: Maybe a somewhat related question in the 1% production guidance for 2011. I know the tricky part is forecasting the base. And I believe last year, you were at 6% base decline underlying those numbers. I was wondering if what you're assuming there in the Gulf of Mexico, activity-wise, and how we can think about incremental risks either way on that guidance or even future production growth?\nJohn Watson: Yes, I'd make a couple of comments. First, in a broad sense, we have seen a reduction in our Base business decline rates. And from 6% or so in past years now into the 3% to 4% range. So I think that reflects a number of things, including the progress that we've made on our Base business work. Now as far as the Gulf of Mexico, going forward, maybe I'll take a minute. This may be a little bit longer answer than you wanted, but I would like to comment on the subject. The progress in getting back to work has been slower than we would have expected. There's some maintenance work going on. But fundamentally, the moratorium's up, but they're not issuing permits. And I think they're trying to get it perfect, in terms of some of the regulations that they're putting in place. And so we keep getting more thrown at us. If you reflect back on the last year, the industry and regulators have done an enormous amount of work to try to raise the bar, if you will, on standards for all operators. I've made it very clear that Chevron has operated at a high standard, but enormous progress has been made to include prevention. So that in the very unlikely event that has been well-documented, it doesn't happen again. And we think that prevention steps have improved. In addition, containment and cleanup is far better than it was. So we're in much better position as an industry than we were previously, and no company, based on the comments I've had from administration officials and regulators, no company has done more to engage the government to try to improve these standards and get us back to work. And my comment here is that time's about up. We can operate very safely. Our industry has an outstanding safety record, notwithstanding the terrible incident of last year. Our days away from work rate in the industry is lower than the federal government's. The fatality rates for serious incidents in the Oil and Gas business is lower than most other manufacturing businesses that you could name. And we just think that the unprecedented step of just shutting down a business has reached the point of diminishing returns, and it's time to get back to work. The administration wants to create jobs. We can create thousands of them. I'm very concerned about energy security for the country, going forward. Independent experts have said that already 300,000 barrels a day have been lost, if you look out three or four years, and that number's going to grow. And that's going to represent a sizable chunk of the spare capacity that the industry expects to see. And that will impact prices, and that will retard economic growth. So we can operate safely. We can create jobs. We can reduce dependence on imports, and I think it's time to get back to work. But I can't tell you how fast this is going to proceed. We seem to take a step forward and then take a step back with difficulties in interpreting the new NTLs that are out there, and we engage heavily. We try to be of assistance, but the bottom line is they're not issuing permits and until they issue permits, Deepwater development, both exploration and development wells, for the most part, won't be drilled. And I wish I could give you a precise timing, but I can't. So that's a long-winded answer to your question, but that's the best I can give you.\nEvan Calio: Does your guidance assume activity in 2011?\nJohn Watson: It does. It does assume that. We've made assumptions about when we might get back to work. That's in there, and there are development wells that we expect to drill. There's activity on the shelf that we have some expectations for. More importantly, exploration wells won't be drilled. We suspended wells that were in progress last year. We'd like to finish those and move on to others. In the grand scheme of things, Chevron can deal with this. It cost us about $100 million or so after tax last year. We can deal with this in the short run, but it's very difficult on small companies. It's very difficult on service providers. We're seeing rigs leave the area, and we just think that time's about up. We need to get back to work. It's the right thing for the country.\nPatricia Yarrington: Evan, I just want to add. The $100 million is really the op-expense-only impact. If you include Gorgon revenues, Gorgon production, obviously, it's much larger than that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Merrill Lynch.\nDouglas Leggate: The absolute tax benefits, please, Pat, by division, if you have them in the quarter? I'm trying to understand what the underlying tax rate was. And while you figure that out, John, the question I have is really a follow-up on Evan's question about production. Obviously, we've got a much higher oil price than any of us really expected internationally, I think, is part of your comment. I'm not so much looking at the PSC sensitivity, I'm thinking more about cost recovery cliffs on some of the new projects, how quickly you actually move through cost recovery such that your underlying production, obviously, after a period of time is moved to the production share. At the same time, given what you said to Evan, what if you don't get back to work in the Gulf, can you give us an indication how that might impact what the range would be, perhaps, in your production outlook? And finally, what's going on with the base decline? And are you're putting money back into gas projects now, which I think was originally what George had deferred capital from before. So if you could kind of round out the production question and then maybe giving a tight sense? That would be great.\nJohn Watson: First, the base decline, as I indicated, company-wide is in the 3% to 4% range. As far as gas investments go, in the United States, once we close the Atlas acquisition, there's a favorable carry in that agreement. So activity in the Marcellus would ramp up as had been the work that's being done by Atlas and planned to be done. So that will ramp up. So we will see more drilling activity there. As far as the Gulf of Mexico goes, we've made some assumptions about when we'll get back to work this year, and I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on that. Now what I would say is if we went the whole year without activity, the number would be lower than what we have put forward. We've exceeded our guidance this year for several reasons. One, the base business results were very good. We've had a little bit higher market demand than we might have expected, and we also didn't have the hurricane season that we thought we'd have. So we factor some of these things in and a few other items, and so we've had good performance. Tengiz performed better than expected last year. So there's some ebbs and flows here that we take into account. In the Gulf of Mexico, it will be important for us to get back to work, for us to continue drilling on the Deepwater projects, we're non-operating position at Perdido there are additional development wells to be drilled there, and we have our own activity. So it's important to us. We have assessed that in providing the guidance that we've put forward, and we'll continue to update it as the year grinds on. So I'm hopeful we'll be back to work. We've been keeping a lot of people and equipment busy doing maintenance and other work, but the Deepwater progress has been slowed significantly. I think I got most of your items there.\nDouglas Leggate: The PSC cliff, John, is there anything we should be aware of?\nJohn Watson: I mean, we do have PSCs out there. Of course, if you hit a cliff sooner that's because you're making more money because prices are higher, and you're recovering your costs faster. But I'm not prepared to talk about any particular cliff or impact here with you today. Pat, do you want to talk a little bit about taxes?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes, on taxes, I mean, the effective tax rate for the quarter was about 39%, and you're right. It's more favorable this quarter than last quarter. A big variable that impacts the effective tax rate for us is the foreign exchange movement, because those really are balance sheet translation effects. They are not taxed, and so depending upon the size of the loss or the size of the gain that you have in any particular quarter, it obviously moves the effective tax rate. So I would just say I'm not -- that really is the primary driver between the quarters. The other thing that has occurred here is, as we earn more out of our Downstream segment, typically, it is coming from lower tax jurisdictions and so you get a mix effect.\nDouglas Leggate: So basically does that get allocated to any particular division? And sorry, John, very quickly, can you qualify the expected contribution from Atlas this year? And how do we get their effects?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes, I mean we booked the taxes in accordance with the segment where the earnings are accrued, the taxes are accrued there as well. Foreign exchange is also in the segment.\nJohn Watson: I'm not going to say much about Atlas. We're in a very sensitive time period right now, leading up to their shareholder vote. With the successful shareholder vote, we'll close the transaction, and we'll be happy to give you more information at that point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng: John, I want to follow up on the Gulf of Mexico. To the event, unfortunately, that if the current impasse continues, at what  point, let's say, a year from now, two years from now, your development cycle time for the Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot off in this current year, assumed to be 2014 start-up, at what point that you start to have a question mark on that start-up date?\nJohn Watson: Paul, the impact on the big projects, I mean, construction we've gone to FID. The facility's work is proceeding. The issue really isn't that it will impact start-up date. The issue is really how many wells will come online at start-up. Because we have  three Deepwater rigs, and we use those rigs for exploration and development. And so we'll have to prioritize once we get back to work, which wells we drill. And we'll make those choices. But obviously, the fewer wells you drill, some of those could be development wells, and so it would push off the ramp-up not so much the first oil date. So Jack/St. Malo's on track for the 2014 start-up, and I don't expect that to be impacted. Only the drilling schedule ramp-up would be the impact.\nPaul Cheng: So you don't think any of the changes in the regulation will impact your design work and you'll have to go back and redo and correspondingly that you don't think that's any real impact on the start-up. It's just that at what pace you can ramp-up or at what we pace you start up at?\nJohn Watson: Well, we're incorporating some design changes now that have come about. I wouldn't advertise these as being material. We've been operating at a very high standard already, and so we have not been significantly impacted. But there are some changes. We can give you a lot more granularity on schedule and information on some of these at our meeting. Jeanette wants to add something here.\nJeanette Ourada: Paul, we have said before that in 2011, the development drilling that we have planned in the Gulf of Mexico, it's towards the end of the year, and we did that intentionally.\nPaul Cheng: John, on the Atlas Energy, what is your overall trend that you look at in the nonconventional play in the U.S. I mean, do you get a sort of like a bridge halfway now and how aggressive do you think you want to increase the exposure in there? And also when we're looking at some of your peers in the recent year, pretty aggressively moving into the nonconventional liquid play, whether it's in the Eagle Ford or Bakken, in some way, that I think Chevron is noticeable or may be left behind or missing in there. So do you think there is a bit too late for you guys to go into those or that you think that you just have to wait, and maybe opportunity will show up?\nJohn Watson: I think you're first talking about unconventional gas, and we feel good about the Atlas acquisition. It's a low-cost resource base, and we'll continue to -- once we get that transaction closed. We feel very good about it, particularly, good about the economics, given the carry that's in place. So we'll continue there, and we continue to look for other opportunities. Up to now, we haven't been as big on the liquids side. But in general, if you look at the unconventional business in the United States, it's been developed by the independents and smaller companies. The reason for that is that there's a great deal of land work that has to be done. And so you're going farm to farm or property owner to property owner. It's a very labor-intensive process. And so you've seen small companies make those moves. In due course, Chevron has the opportunity to come in. We do think we have something to offer from a technology point of view, and we'll continue to evaluate the opportunities that we see on either gas or liquids. I would note that we've been pretty active internationally, as I commented earlier, adding acreage and we continue to look for new opportunities.\nPaul Cheng: In the U.S. Downstream, excluding the asset sales gain you earned of $75 million, Chemical earning is up, and based on what your partner Conoco report, it seems to suggest the U.S. power and [indiscernible] lost quite a bit of money in the quarter. In some way, that is surprising because the market condition, quite frankly, is not really that bad in the fourth quarter. I understand you have downtime, but looking at your total throughput, it's not necessarily much worse than the other quarter in the last two years. So does it mean that your operation in the refining, basically, that will lose money in the kind of market condition we saw in the fourth quarter?\nJohn Watson: Let me add a couple of comments, and then I'll let Pat offer a few things. The first comment I'd make is we've been very pleased with our Chemical business. It was a decade ago that we put together Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, and it's far exceeded the expectations that I had at that time. So it has been profitable. We also have an additives business that's been successful as well. And we did put these businesses together in the last year so that Mike Wirth and his team really can make the right manufacturing and marketing decisions for all the molecules together in the Downstream and Chemicals business, and that's gone quite well. I'll let Pat comment a little bit on profitability, noting that margins were different on the Gulf Coast and West Coast.\nPatricia Yarrington: Right. I mean, I think the primary thing you want to take into account here for the fourth quarter were the impacts of turnarounds. It was a significant turnaround quarter that is not unusual in the fourth quarter of the year. Actually, it's not unusual in the first quarter of the year either. That significantly impacted the segment results for the basic R&M.\nJohn Watson: Mike and his team has done a fantastic job this year, this last year, of delivering on the things that he outlined last year. We've gone through some difficult times with employees, but we've really exceeded our expectations in that regard, capturing benefits. And we've, as I noted earlier, made some of the portfolio moves. Mike will give you a lot more update on this, but our Downstream business is doing well and on track to deliver the improvements in returns that he outlined. We've got a three-year plan to do that, and we're ahead of pace for the first year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel from Macquarie.\nJason Gammel: I wanted to ask about a couple of the capital projects that will be coming up in the Final Investment Decision. First of all, on Wheatstone, John, do you think you have enough contracted offtake already to be able to move forward with the project or are incremental offtake contracts still necessary for FID? And are you seeing any cost pressures at Gorgon that would potentially cause you to go back and look at your estimates again or even to delay the Final Investment Decision, so as not to be competing with your own project?\nJohn Watson: On the offtake, we've been really pleased with the marketing that we've been doing for both Gorgon and Wheatstone. In fact, we announced another agreement very recently. We're at the 80% and 90% level for both projects in terms of agreements that we have in place, and we certainly don't view sales agreements as an impediment to a Final Investment Decision for Wheatstone. In terms of cost pressures, we're going through the engineering work now, and we expect, based on what we're seeing, they will have a good handle on costs sufficient to make a Final Investment Decision later in the year. We're, obviously, very close to what's happening in the markets because of our position in Gorgon. Gorgon is a $37 billion project, but we've let contracts totaling about $25 billion so far. So we have a good idea what's in the marketplace. We're monitoring it well, and I don't expect that those cost pressures, which are real, will impact Final Investment Decision, since we've got a pretty good idea of where they come from and how to mitigate them.\nJason Gammel: And then with the decision now to extend the Caspian Pipeline and given that you're seeing just tremendous reservoir performance at Tengiz, when would you envision that you would be looking for sanctioning the next phase of Tengiz expansion?\nJohn Watson: A couple of comments. First, it's both reservoir and facilities performance at Tengiz that has been very good. In terms of sanctioning it, I think the first thing's first, we'll make a fee decision in 2011. And we'll give you a little more detail in March, when we come back on maybe what the timing would be. I will say this, we learned a lot from the first expansion project. The technology is now proven. It's actually a simpler project than the expansion we just completed, and I won't say it's a simple project. But it is simpler in scope, given what we've learned about injection technology during that time period. So feed very soon and then FID following.\nJason Gammel: Do you think Tengiz eventually gets to 1 million barrels a day?\nJohn Watson: I'll just say that we have another nice expansion coming, and I'll let George give you a little bit of update on that. But certainly, there's more there than the over 600,000 barrels a day that we've been producing on 100% basis recently.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Gilman of Benchmark Group.\nMark Gilman: John, can you give us a number for non-PSC variable royalty-related revisions implicit in the reserve numbers?\nJohn Watson: No. Mark, I'm not trying to be cagey. We just don't give out that level of information. We talked about the price effect taking about 13 points off the replacement rate, but we haven't gotten into the specifics of the PSCs.\nMark Gilman: Pat, in your comments you referenced I think on several occasions in terms of PSC sensitivity this 2,000 equivalents per day per dollar kind of number. Would you expect that to change in 2011, at all, one way or the other?\nPatricia Yarrington: The reason we give you the numbers, Mark, relative to the previous historical period is so that you can see what the relationship has been. I don't know what prices are going to be, going forward. We tried to give you that number. It's been in that 2,000, 1,800 to 2,000 barrel per WTI dollar for quite some time. I think that's a reasonable assumption, a reasonable planning base for you going forward.\nMark Gilman: Give me an idea of any negative impact of rig contracts on U.S. Upstream results, both in the fourth quarter and full year '10?\nPatricia Yarrington: Well, we said earlier that the operating expense on an after-tax basis was $100 million or so. But that's predominantly the rig impact. On a full P&L basis, of course, we have the loss production, really thinking something a couple of hundred million dollars or so.\nMark Gilman: So the $100 million is rig cancellation charges and things like that?\nPatricia Yarrington: No, it's really just idled rigs, costs associated with idled rigs.\nMark Gilman: And you expensed that?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes.\nJason Gammel: What would be the number if there were no activity in 2011, Pat?\nPatricia Yarrington: Well, I'm not going to go there. I'm just giving you the impact of the moratorium for us here, both from an op expense and the total P&L standpoint.\nJohn Watson: We've got three Deepwater rigs under contract. One of them is drilling an injection well in Tahiti right now. This market will depend upon the degree to which we can quickly put these rigs to work.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.\nFaisel Khan: First on exploration. Can you just give us an update of how exploration went in the fourth quarter? I believe you were drilling the Lagavulin well and any other wells you were drilling in the quarter?\nJohn Watson: Yes, we don't have anything to say on the Lagavulin well, just yet but you're correct. It is drilling. We did announce a discovery in the Republic of the Congo. Our partner, our non-operating partner there, that's certainly encouraging. And then Australia, the progress has continued with additional discoveries there. We don't have any news, obviously, from the Gulf of Mexico because we weren't able to conduct any activity there.\nFaisel Khan: And then just on the liftings, you've mentioned you have higher liftings in Indonesia and Kazakhstan. I take it those were -- what was the quantity of overlifts you guys had in the quarter?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes, in the third quarter, we were underlifted in excess of 3%. In the fourth quarter, we were underlifted just about 1%. And for the year, we were underlifted about 1%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: First regarding Australia, kind of following up on the earlier question about cost escalation, anything that is happening in terms of project delays that is labor shortages, et cetera, that is perhaps shifting timelines for either Gorgon or Wheatstone as you currently see it?\nJohn Watson: No. It hasn't. In the Australian press, you'll see things reported from time to time, and we do adjust the schedule of work. For example, right now, we've got cyclones that are going through the area. So that, obviously, impacts work. So you read about these adjustments, but we managed that in the context of an overall critical-path set of activities, and we're on that critical path. Labor is certainly a significant issue to be monitored in Australia. As it is, frankly, with all big onshore projects around the world. We've got good relationships with the unions. I think the best thing we can do to maintain those relationships with unions is to communicate well and to keep the outstanding safety record that we have, because that's certainly a priority of the union. But at this point, we haven't seen any significant shifts in activity and certainly not because of issues involving labor.\nPavel Molchanov: Let me turn to Poland. Given that you will now have the in-house expertise from Atlas, is that going to change your Polish shale gas program at all in terms of moving personnel over or just transferring that skill set overseas?\nJohn Watson: Well, it's a little early to tell. As I say, once we close the Atlas transaction, we'll be in a better position to talk about that. But certainly, the expertise we're picking up, well first, Chevron has expertise. We've drilled hundreds of wells in the peons-type gas wells. We've been active in the Haynesville. So we do have expertise. But certainly, with the acquisition of Atlas, that will help us. Now we expect to drill our first well later this year, actually, in Poland. So as we close that transaction, we'll assess the people that we have, and I think one advantage for the people of Atlas will be the opportunities that will be available elsewhere in the Chevron system, including Poland and overseas. So I'm hopeful that it will help us.\nPavel Molchanov: And where is your current Polish acreage position at? Is it still at 1.1 million, I believe.\nJohn Watson: Yes, it is.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Iain Reid of Jefferies.\nIain Reid: In Angola, there's quite a lot of excitement about the pre-salt of having some blocks were awarded recently. But as far as I'm aware, I didn't see Chevron in that group of companies. I just wondered whether you could talk about what you think about the pre-salt, and Angola, and are you going to drill that from your existing acreage?\nJohn Watson: Well, you're correct, basically, in the recent lease round. We're very prudent in what we did, and if we're unable to capture some of it because of prices, so be it. I would tell you over the last few years, we have participated in some of the lease rounds, this time we didn't capture anything. Beyond that, I probably don't have a great deal to say other than we continue to ramp up Tombua-Landana there and have had a long and very good relationship there. Our focus right now, frankly, is on Angola LNG. That project is progressing very well toward first gas. And that's been the big focus for us recently.\nIain Reid: So you don't have any plans to drill any deeper wells in the basin, so below the tertiary to test the pre-salt?\nJohn Watson: I don't have anything for you right now in that. If we've got more to say about the pre-salt, I'll be sure that George covers that in March.\nIain Reid: In Kazakhstan, you're a partner in Karachaganak, where there's been dispute over taxes and also issues of the state company trying to push their way into the license, are you seeing anything of the same issues in Tengiz at the moment?\nJohn Watson: Well, you're correct. There have been some concerns that have been voiced by the government, and the partners are working through that with the government. I'm confident we'll get to some resolution. At Tengiz, from time to time, we have issues that are raised, but we have rigidly adhered to the contract. We've performed very well, and we've always been able to work through any issues without a material impact. And I would say the same thing is true today. We're held up in Kazakhstan as the company that has best delivered on what the government has expected. So in my visits with the President and in our relationships there, they've been very good. Recognizing that from time-to-time, there are differences of opinion, but we've been able to work through them well. We're in a good place in Tengiz would be my comment.\nIain Reid: So there's no issues of that nature that would stop you further expanding Tengiz?\nJohn Watson: No. We appreciate the very good questions. Thanks, Shawn. Let me just say that we appreciate your participation in the call. I'd like to thank the analysts, and I'd like to remind you that we do have our Security Analyst Meeting in March, and we look forward to seeing you there. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-10-29 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I will be your conference.  Facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington.\nPatricia Yarrington: Thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today are Mike Wirth, Executive Vice President of Downstream and Chemicals; and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2010. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. And I ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $3.8 billion or $1.87 per diluted share. Our third quarter 2010 earnings were flat compared to third quarter 2009. Compared to the second quarter 2010, earnings fell 30%. Janet will discuss the sequential earnings variance shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $10.6 billion and our debt ratio was 9.4%. Total cash at the end of the quarter was $14.5 billion, and this was after a $550 million pension contribution. Third quarter was our strongest cash generation quarter since third quarter 2008. As you will see in the remainder of our presentation, our third quarter earnings were negatively impacted by several large items, which had no corresponding impact on cash. A prime example here is foreign exchange, the quarter's earnings almost $370 million in foreign exchange losses, which were simply balance sheet translation effects. In July, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program as previously announced, we will begin repurchases in the fourth quarter here. We are targeting a repurchase rate between $500 million and $1 billion per quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we expect to repurchase $750 million of our shares. Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.\nJeanette Ourada: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 4. I will compare results of third quarter 2010 with second quarter 2010. As a reminder, our earnings release compares third quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from the second quarter. Results for all segments dropped between periods. Upstream earnings were $978 million lower, largely due to unfavorable foreign currency variants and higher exploration expenses. Third quarter downstream results were $410 million lower, driven by adverse foreign currency and timing of variances.  The other bar largely reflects the unfavorable pool in corporate tax items. On Slide 5, our U.S. upstream earnings for the third quarter were $144 million lower than the second quarter's results. Crude oil realizations reduced earnings by $55 million. Chevron's U.S. crude realizations fell about $2 per barrel between consecutive quarters, slightly more than the 2% change in WTI spot prices. Natural gas realizations were flat between periods. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $35 million between periods, primarily due to impacts from the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium.  The other bar represents a decrease of $54 million, which is comprised of a number of unrelated items, including higher asset impairment charges. Turning to Slide 6, international upstream earnings were down $834 million compared with the second quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $40 million, with lower liquids realizations, partially offset by higher natural gas realizations. Our average liquids realizations decreased 2% between quarters, in line with the decrease in average brand spot prices. Natural gas realizations improved 8% between quarters. Lower listings decreased earnings by $115 million. For the third quarter, we were underlisted by over 3%, bringing the year-to-date position to slightly over 1% underlisted. Higher exploration expense reduced earnings by $210 million due to well write offs in Turkey and Canada. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects lowered earnings between quarters by $350 million. The second quarter had a gain of about $100 million compared to a $250 million loss in the third quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including higher depreciation and lower pipeline and sulfur for earnings. In the interim update, we forecast $200 million of discreet items in the International Upstream segment. These items include an out-of-period depreciation adjustment and an equity redetermination of a field covering multiple leases. The depreciation adjustment covered multiple years, and was not material in any year.  These items were either non-cash or cash neutral. Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 8,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price changes had a modest effect on volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts in the third quarter, increasing production about 2,000 barrels per day. The average WTI price declined about $1.75 per barrel between quarters. Base business production decreased 30,000 barrels per day between quarters, mainly due to plant turnarounds in Europe and normal field declines, partly offset by higher demand in Thailand. As shown in the green bar, contributions from major capital projects increased third quarter production by 20,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by lower plant shutdown activities at Tengiz in Kazakhstan. Before I turn to the downstream results, I'd like to note that our upstream adjusted earnings for the quarter were $14.65 per barrel. Based on preliminary competitor results announced today, we continue to lead our peer group on this metric for the fifth consecutive quarter. Turning to Slide 8, U.S. downstream earnings fell $84 million in the third quarter. Indicator margins reduced earnings by $60 million. Gulf Coast Refining indicator margins fell by 20% due to tempered demand growth and high inventories. West Coast refining indicator margins were relatively flat. Actual margin capture and higher volumes added a small increase to earnings. The other bar consists of several unrelated items, including unfavorable mark-to-market effects on open paper, partly offset by better core trading results. International downstream earnings were also lower, decreasing $326 million from second quarter's results. Higher margins in volumes benefited earnings by $50 million, with each contributing about half the variance. Improved margins in Asia and Canada were partly offset by declines in Europe. Volumes were also higher in the third quarter, in part due to the absence of second quarter plant maintenance at our Cape Town refinery. An adverse swing in foreign currency effects reduced earnings by $250 million. Second quarter included a $130 million gain, while third quarter had $120 million loss. Timing effects represented $180 million negative variance between quarters, reflecting inventory revaluation and unfavorable mark-to-market effects on open paper tied to underlying physical positions. In the second quarter, WTI prices moved down from the beginning to the end of the quarter, generating a paper gain. In the third quarter, WTI prices moved up from the beginning to the end of the quarter, generating a paper loss. The other bar is comprised of several unrelated items, including better core trading results and a favorable OpEx variance due to the absence of the second quarter plant turnaround at Cape Town. Slide 10 covers all other. Third quarter net charges were $361 million compared to a net $108 million charge in the second quarter, an increase of $253 million between quarters. An unfavorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $259 million variance. Corporate charges were modestly lower in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, this segment has net charges of approximately $850 million. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the all other segment is still appropriate going forward. Mike is now here to provide an update on our Downstream business. Mike?\nMichael Wirth: Thanks, Jeanette. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to update everyone on the progress we've made in restructuring Downstream and improving performance. Just a quick comment on the results jeanette just covered, we've had a good quarter and, in fact, a good nine months, especially given the amount of change underway. Our financial results have improved markedly from last year due to good execution in the Base business and steady progress on the improvement initiatives we've undertaken. And while the benefits from some of those improvements are reflected in our results, others are only beginning to appear now, and the full effects should be seen in the coming quarters. I'm especially proud of our continued strong performance in the areas of safety and reliability. Through nine months, downstream is experiencing its safest year ever. In terms of reliability, the utilization of our refinery units continues to be high as it has been for the last several years. I'd like to share some details on our restructuring efforts and major capital projects, both of which are right on track. Please turn to Slide 12.  As I told you on March, our focus is on improving returns. I committed to delivering operational excellence in our Base business, while high-grading our portfolio, reducing costs and improving revenues. At the end of September, a new, leaner organizational structure was in place. Every employee knows their status in the new organization. We expect to meet our target of 2,000 workforce reductions by the end of 2010. We've captured $275 million improvement in our refining system versus our 2008 Solomon baseline. Most of this comes through cost reductions, including reduced contract accounts and less employee overtime due to increased work productivity, and renegotiated contracts for materials, chemicals and contract labor. We're also increasing refinery profitability through improved energy efficiency, better yield optimization and tighter blending tolerances to reduce specification giveaway. Turning to Slide 13 -- we've also taken action to high-grade our portfolio to create a simpler footprint and improve focus on efficiency. We completed the previously announced market exit from 12 states in the eastern U.S. We've closed the sale and transitioned operations of four terminals and are our continuing negotiations on nine others. Sales agreements have been signed for our businesses in eight African countries. Some of these could close as early as the fourth quarter and the balance will close in 2011. Earlier this month, we announced the sale of our minority interest in the Colonial Pipeline Co. to KKR. You'll see the financial impact of this sale in fourth quarter results. And divestiture efforts are in progress for assets in Europe, the Caribbean and selected countries in Central America. Data rooms are currently opened and are being accessed by potential bidders. And we're close to finalizing a sales agreement for our businesses in western Caribbean and parts of Central America. We'll continue to keep you advised us of these transactions materialize. Now turning to Slide 13. Capital discipline is an essential part of our commitment to improve returns. Our 2010 capital budget is 23% lower than it was in 2009, and I expect will come in even further below that number. Having said that, we do have a few key projects underway that I'd like to update you on. The Ras Laffan olefins complex, which is a greenfield world-scale ethylene cracker and cutter was started up successfully in the second quarter of this year. In Yosu, South Korea, a new heavy oil hydrocracker  will lower feedstock costs and increase high-value product yield. This project was mechanically completed in June, two months ahead of schedule, and came on stream in the third quarter. The Pascagoula continuous catalytic reformer project, which will enhance reliability and performance, has reached mechanical completion and is in final commissioning. In the Saudi Polymer (sic) [Polymers] Company project, another greenfield, world-scale ethylene cracker with derivative units is on track for start up in 2011. I'd like to say a few words about the two chemical projects. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company has developed these Middle East ventures based on attractive feedstock terms, world-class economies of scale, strong partner relations and excellent project execution. They'll be coming online into what we expect to be the beginning of an up cycle, and they should perform well in the years ahead. So in summary, I'm pleased to report the progress we've made on our restructuring to improve performance and to deliver on our commitment to improve returns. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Pat.\nPatricia Yarrington: Thanks, Mike. Now turning to Slide 14. I'd like to close with a recap of Chevron's strategic highlights during the third quarter. We continued our record-setting trend in safety performance. Mike provided you with an update of our downstream restructuring, which is on track and progressing well. In our upstream business, we had a number of accomplishments in the third quarter. We continued our exploration success in Australia with natural gas discoveries at Acme and Briar Road [ph] (20:04). These discoveries will further contribute to expansion opportunities for Gorgon and Wheatstone. We acquired exploration acreage in several new prospective Deepwater basins. Offshore Liberia, China's Pearl River Mouth Basin and the Turkish sector of the Black Sea. These are large blocks and the combined total exploratory acreage, exceeds 20,000 square miles or 53,000 square kilometers. And finally, we sanctioned two Deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico. The Tahiti 2 project will drill to additional producing wells and three additional water injection wells to extend Tahiti's peak production and increase ultimate recovery. We received a permit to drill a water injection well at Tahiti and began drilling there with the discovery of clear leader [ph] (20:56) in late September. We also authorized a $7.5 billion Jack/St. Malo development. This will be Chevron's first operated project in the Lower Tertiary. The development is a semi-submersible, floating production facility hub, in 7,000 feet of water, with multiple subsea tiebacks. The Jack/St. Malo fields are estimated to contain, combined total recoverable resources in excess of $500 million oil-equivalent barrels. We do not expect to book pre-reserves for these project in 2010. We are pleased that the drilling moratorium has been lifted. This is the first step needed to return thousands of people to work and to begin drilling back in the Gulf. The second step is reemergence on the efficient permitting process. We have submitted one Deepwater drilling permit, and we have an active exploration and development drilling program planned for 2011. We are actively trying to understand and address any remaining issues that the regulators may have. We remain hopeful that drilling approvals will be received in a timely manner. In summary, our base business is healthy and robust. We're on track to meet our revised production target for the year. We're meeting key milestones and progressing our major capital projects and our downstream is delivering on its restructuring commitment. Our cash generation is superb, giving us the flexibility to reinvest in our business and return immediate value to our shareholders through a growing dividend stream and share repurchase. We are certainly executing on all our key strategies. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And now I am happy to open up the floor for any of your questions. Sean, please open up the line?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: Since Mike's this quarter's special guest, let me start with a question on the Downstream. Mike, could you update us on the sales process for Pembroke or how it's shaping up, interest level, exceed expectations and when you expect it might close? And then any update on Hawaii? You mentioned Hawaii in terms of either sale closure or kind of renegotiation of that contract there.\nMichael Wirth: I'll start with Pembroke and remind you that they're also additional European assets included with that. Some fuels marketing in the U.K., Ireland, Spain, the Canary Islands, aviation, et cetera. We started out with a long list of bidders earlier this year and got some strong indications of interest. We subsequently narrowed that to a shorter list of preferred bidders and are in the process now of working with them to finalize their proposals. As I mentioned in my comments, the data room is open and being accessed by these bidders. They have all conducted site visits and are deep into their due diligence. We expect to see their final proposals later here in the fourth quarter. I can tell you the interest has been strong. This is a good refinery. It's a 210,000 barrel-a-day facility with good complexity, a natural deepwater port that makes the logistics just excellent for bringing in advantage crude and also for exporting products into global markets, and the marketing assets are attractive as well. So it's a good asset and a good package. It doesn't fit with our portfolio, which is really focused into North America and Asia, but for others who have a better fit, it's attractive. And we've got an excellent workforce there. So we've seen strong interest from what I consider to be good quality bidders and the process continues. So we'll have more to say on that as we receive final bids, and then move into negotiations. Relative to Hawaii, as I think I mentioned in March, we had reviewed the continued operation of that facility and alternatives to convert it to a terminal. We concluded that there wasn't really a value-creating move in conversion to a terminal. So we've continued to operate as a refinery. We have restructured several contracts, including one critical large fuel oil contract there to improve the profitability of the facility, and we found more optimization opportunities within our system. So the performance of the refinery has improved since I saw you in March. Having said that, we're still looking at our alternatives here to return the maximum value to our shareholders. And so other alternatives are still under consideration. We'll have a more to say about that as we reach any critical decisions.\nEvan Calio: Moving to the upstream. I know the CapEx level elevated in 29 when you brought on a series of material projects that were almost 500,000 barrels a day and Blind Faith, Agbami, Tengiz, Tahiti, Frade and a few others. Should we expect another CapEx increase off your 21.6 year-on-year with the big project queue into 2013 through '15?\nPatricia Yarrington: We're not prepared at this point to give you a new number for 2011. We customarily do that. We're reviewing the plans right now. And we customarily do that after we have board approval for the plans as to that'll be. Some time later this year or early in January. But it's clear we are investing at a healthy pace. We do have strong cash flows and we have a low leverage, and the breadth and depth of our queue is extraordinary and it gives us a lot of flexibility, those factors combined, give us a lot of flexibility in project selection. You mentioned and we do have these large projects on the horizon: Gorgon, Wheatstone, Deep Water. And we were successful here in this last quarter, in particular, in picking up some new resource opportunities and those resource opportunities will require further evaluation. So I do think you will see our outlays go up. But our projects are staggered, and as we sift through our opportunities, we always do an affordability overlay. And in that overlay, we take into account commodity prices, industry cost and different scenarios. And so this issue is in the end, that our C&E program is affordable, even in less-robust scenario situations and that only the best projects get funded.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDouglas Leggate: Mike, on your comments about expecting the beginning of an upcycle, I'm just kind of curious if you could give us a little color as to where your head is on the environment right now? And if I may just jump on the Hawaii question, could you elaborate a little bit on the fuel contract? I think I heard you say you've already secured it. I was not aware the regulator had approved it yet. But if you can give some color on that?\nMichael Wirth: My reference to projects coming on into an upcycle was specifically directed at the two chemicals projects that I made reference to. And we've actually seen a pretty good chemicals market this year, more so in the first half than in the second half, where margins have been softening as we've seen some additional capacity come online. But as we move through the next few quarters where we could continue to see that softening trend hold as economies really gain traction out into the medium term. The chemicals cycle looks as if it's poised for an upturn. And so we're very pleased with the performance of our chemicals affiliates, both at Chevron Phillips Chemical and in Korea with GS Caltex in our wholly-owned specialty, additive chemical company. And we think the fundamentals in that sector are encouraging out into the medium term. I want to be sure that I differentiate that from the refining segments where I don't share nearly as a bullish view in the refining sector. We continue to see pretty tepid demand growth. Some parts of the world, certainly, showing decent demand growth. Others are not. And the continued incursion of mandated alternative fuels, fuel efficiency and the addition of refining capacity, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, will contribute what we believe to an overhang in refining capacity for years to come. And so, on the refining side of our business, we are prepared for tough conditions for several years out into the future, and that's why the focus on itself helped that I've been talking about in recent discussions with you. Hawaii, the contract, the fuel contract, has been renegotiated. I have to tell you, Doug, I'm not current on the state of regulatory approval. I know it's been submitted for regulatory approval, but I'll have to have Jeanette get back to you with a specific answer on that because I just don't recall.\nDouglas Leggate: What's Chevron's stance on Prop 23 [Proposition 23]?\nMichael Wirth: We've taken a neutral stance on Prop 23, Doug. It's an interesting question. This is the first time to my knowledge that voters are actually going to speak on climate regulation. I think the proposition really raises a legitimate issue about the impact on the economy and on jobs. Carbon regulations will not come for free. And California has real economic challenges. And California cannot materially impact global CO2 emissions on its own. So I think it's a very legitimate question has been put forward through this proposition. Having said that, we have taken a neutral position on Prop 23. We have a different footprint in this state than perhaps some others do, and this is our home. We continue to work closely with the air resources Board and the governor's staff to seek reasonable market-based solutions for carbon reduction in California. And we're looking at how we would meet AB 32 in the most technically feasible and cost-effective manner. It's tough because the final regulations are not complete, so there's still some uncertainty out there. But in a broader context, we've been working to address climate change really through a variety of different strategies. A higher energy efficiency, which we've been working on really for the last two decades. We spent a lot of money on R&D and improved technologies, focused on renewables, energy efficiency. Looking for promising and profitable opportunities and things like our warehousing venture and then supporting flexible on some policies. So we're preparing ourselves to deal with climate regulation and deal with it on a business context. But we have stayed neutral on Prop 23.\nDouglas Leggate: My quick follow-up for Pat. Exploration spend was up in the third quarter. It seems to light in the first half of the year. Can you give us an idea how you expect that to trend? And also DD&A stepped up in the third quarter. If you could help us understand what's was going on there, that would be great.\nPatricia Yarrington: The exploration expense certainly did move up in the third quarter. Jeanette referenced two significant well write-offs in Turkey and Canada. I think if you look at us year-to-date 2010 versus year-to-date 2009, you will still find, however, that our 2010 expense outlet factor is about 25% or so lower than year-to-date 2009. This tends to be a very lumpy item for us. Some of these wells are very expensive wells, and some of these circumstances is pure wildcat-ing, and so it's very hard for us to predict. On DD&A, you also saw a step up. Jeanette also mentioned some of the retroactive adjustments that we have there. Again, year-to-date, 2010 versus 2009, we're seeing higher impacts associated with rates, but also higher production.\nDouglas Leggate: So that DD&A rate is probably a good go-forward number? Farther, is the trend still higher?\nPatricia Yarrington: We did mention the -- it was not a period adjustment so the vast majority of that increase would not be going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: How much CO2 do you emit in California, I wondered? And secondly, could you talk a little bit more about the Asian oil market in general? I know you guys have a huge footprint there. I'd just be very interested by any observations you have on how market dynamics is shifting both from the supply side in terms of refining capacity, availability and crude use and also on the demand side?\nMichael Wirth: Paul, on your first question, on carbon emissions in California, I'd point you to our corporate responsibility report. Where we make a lot of disclosures and everything that we publicly disclosed on carbon is in there. And I don't have a copy in front of me right now. We've got both upstream and downstream operations here. So I'd just point you to that. On Asia, it is certainly the most optimistic part of the world in terms of economic growth. I've recently been over there and visited multiple countries. I will tell you it is not homogeneous by any means. There is a strongly growing Asia that is really represented by China, primarily, but also a number of other economies. Singapore is exceptionally strong. Vietnam is strong. So there's a very rapidly growing Asia where we see strong demand for our products. There's a modestly growing Asia, which is still pretty attractive. Markets like Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, where we see growth and its good growth but it's not as strong as you would see in China and some of the others. And then there's a part of Asia that doesn't look a heck of a lot better than the U.S. And growth is negative is still in Japan and fairly flattish in places like South Korea or the Philippines or Thailand. And so we really have exposure to a number of those markets. And we have the ability to try to optimize our refinery production and our supply activities into those markets that have the strongest growth characteristics, the best margin opportunities and try to mitigate some of the exposure to the weaker markets and optimize there. So I think increasingly, we all need to be paying attention to Asia in our business because it is really where the growth will occur. But the key point, I think, is that there are many different countries in Asia and their economic circumstances are vary pretty dramatically.\nPaul Sankey: How are you planning the supply side in terms of shutdowns? I'm thinking of Japan, maybe some lost capacity in China and some low utilization rates perhaps among some other players.\nMichael Wirth: We certainly have seen some announced intentions to shut in capacity in the countries you referenced, Japan and China. Frankly, I think these tend to occur at the margin. And as you look at some of the tea kettle refineries in China or some of the changes in Japan, you also have to look at some of the big new builds in China. The capacity that's pretty fresh, new in India, Vietnam has brought on a new refining capacity. And so net, the capacity is going up not down in Asia. And even with some economic utilization cutbacks and turnarounds, Asia's long, the world's long. And so I think we really do need demand growth to steadily chew into that. Perhaps some projects will be delayed but haven't started construction at this point. And some slow and gradual rationalization. But as I mentioned earlier, we're not banking on a rapid rationalization of the industry in a return to tighter supply and demand balances anytime soon.\nPaul Sankey: Then if I could have an upstream one, you mentioned there's an impact, obviously, for the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico. But you submitted a permit. I was wondering if you could be a little bit more specific about the volume impact that that's having right now? I guess it's an accelerating effect with decline rates. And I just wondered if we could somehow get a sense of when you think you may be able to resume, for example, how long it would be before you resumed activity after you received the permit? Or is there any way you can frame how long you think it will be before you resume?\nPatricia Yarrington: Sure, Paul. In terms of the impact in the quarter, really I'm going to talk about the second half of the year, we are estimating a volume impact somewhere less than 10,000 barrels a day. And of course we've got operating expense impacts that Jeanette referenced as well. Those, with the moratorium lifted, as long as we get back to having permits actually authorized and of course those effects become muted. It's very hard to all for us to say exactly how long a return to -- how long it will take for the permits to be authorized. We're working very aggressively with the BOEM to understand what their uncertainties are and to try to work through that very, very quickly. As I did mention, we are doing the Tahiti water injection well. So there's some progress, but I think it's going to be slow. And we're hopeful in the next several weeks, few weeks, couple of months that we'll have a better indication of a long exactly it will take to get through the permitting process.\nPaul Sankey: Is there a very serious potential impact on volumes for next year, at least the portion of your Gulf of Mexico volumes, say for example, if there was no more activity in the next year?\nPatricia Yarrington: Paul, it's really too early for us to give an indication of that. I mean we're right in the midst of trying to get things back to work.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng: Mike, I think historically, you guys looking at Asia as a major coal market for you because of the growth. But on the other hand, as you indicate, there's enough new capacity coming up and a lot of content may be driven by certain national priority. And so while that demand is growing, capacity is since that we growing even at a faster pace. And so does that change your view of the attractiveness of Asia as your coal market? And the second question is on the chemical. Saudi Arabia, look right now, they are already short in their domestic discipline. Do you have a long-term, feed stock gas price contract for the next 20 years? Or that, I don't know the exact term, but if you give us some idea that -- how sustainable is your cost advantage on there? And also within chemical, do you believe that the joint venture structure is the best on a going forward or that it will be better off to be owned by the single parties?\nMichael Wirth: On the attractiveness of Asia, I think you really have to look at this in a broad sweep of time. And long term, the next several decades I think are the decades where Asia will move into a very prominent role in the global economy. And there will be attractive opportunities to participate in that. We aren't going to jump into projects just to be in Asia and invest there. We need to have profitable investments and, particularly in the Downstream and Chemicals business, we are keenly aware of the realities of a margin-based business and supply and demand. So we'll be very thoughtful in terms of anything we would do. And certainly, as I said, over the near to medium term, we're expecting some pretty tough sliding. And frankly, you're seeing others say the same things and some begin to behave that way as projects have slowed down and the like. And so we're not going to plow into things just to be there. We got a good strong position right now. We can optimize that position and look for the right kinds of opportunities over time to profitably participate in that growth. And so I think it's still an attractive market to us but we're going to be really prudent in terms of how we participate in growth. On your question relative to Saudi Arabia and feedstock for our ethylene cracker, I can tell you we do have a long-term feedstock arrangement that underpins that investment. And I won't go into the specifics on that, but we do indeed have an agreement there that gives us attractive feedstock economics. And finally on your question on the joint venture structures, I said we've been very pleased with the performance of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. They have, I think, a very strong track record in their sector and have been one of the steadily improving performers in that segment. And we're happy with that. In terms of any alternative structures, we don't comment on M&A or things like that. And so I'll stay consistent with our practice and not say anything more.\nPaul Cheng: A quick one on the upstream, Jeanette. For the underlift in this quarter, say $150 million, look like second quarter was pretty flat or pretty balanced and you didn't really have an overlift or underlift. Should we assume the entire $150 million is a result of the third quarter of the underlift?\nJeanette Ourada: Paul, the bar that shows on that graph is comparing absolute liftings in the second quarter then the third quarter. So it's the value differential between those two. My comment about the underlift in the quarter, so compared to two productions in the quarter we were understood by 3% into third quarter. I think I told you on last quarter's call, in the second quarter, we were about 1% overlifted. So that's only a swing between quarters.\nPatricia Yarrington: Paul, this is Pat. Just wanted to go back and add one thought to the question on the joint venture structure. We have tremendous alignment between ourselves and Conoco. And usually, when you have good alignment between the partners, things work out really quite well. And sponsored doesn't become a statement issue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.\nMark Gilman: Mike, I was wondering if you could give me some idea as to the total costs of the Yosu hydrocracker and what kind of return you expect there? And also address what you're likely or maybe considering doing with your West Coast problem child, which I call Richmond? On the upstream side of the business, Pat, you might be able to respond to this, with the success that you continue to have in terms of exploration for Australia and the northwestern shelf (sic) [North West Shelf], is any consideration being given to scaling up Wheatstone not just in terms of potential down-the-road expansion opportunities but to go with a much larger project right up front similar to what happened with respect to the progression of the Gorgon project?\nMichael Wirth: Paul, I'll start out. On Yosu, it's actually a question that -- I'm not going to give you the total cost on it because actually, there's some portions of the project that are not yet completed. So there's an FCC, that's the second part of this, to take some of the gas off the new vacuum column there that was started up a couple of years back. So we don't have cost, but I can tell it's below budget, it's very competitive as we benchmark through IPA [ph] (55:25) and the industry benchmarking process. They have a consistent history of delivering projects at very strong capital efficiency. The other thing I would tell is it's completely funded out of their cash flow from their balance sheet. We don't inject any cash into GS Caltex. Relative to your question on Richmond, we love all our children whether they're problem children or not. And we're continuing to work to try to find a solution there. I think since the last time that we were together in March, the California appeals court has ruled on the lower court ruling on the EIR. At the time we were together in March, we've made our appeal, but we have not heard back. They ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, which we continue to disagree but that is the ruling of the court. Where we are right now is in discussions with various stakeholders to see if we can find some sort of a reasonable solution here. The stakeholders include the City of Richmond, senior representatives from both the legislature and other political officials in the state and the plaintiffs on this thing. I can't predict the outcome of the discussions. We're trying to find a reasonable solution that allows us to maintain a competitive facility in Richmond. We've been operating there for more than 100 years, and we hope to continue to do so competitively. But there are some realities that we have to face as well. And so the discussions have been ongoing for some time, and we're still hopeful that we'll find a solution there through that path.\nPatricia Yarrington: And just on the Wheatstone question, as you know, we've got process underway for capacity of about two trends of 4.3 million tons per year. So it gives you 8.6 million tons. We actually have plus space at Wheatstone for maybe five to six trains. But in addition to just having the cost space, we obviously have to go after the environmental permits as well. So I think the best answer to your question, Mark, really is that our team will be looking at what, and looking at the gas availability that we have, the cost base that we have, the economics and then also the environmental issues. That combination of factors will really dictate optimum expansion at Wheatstone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faisal Khan with Citigroup.\nFaisel Khan: Mike, on the Chemical business, just curious, given what's going on at U.S. natural gas prices, would you guys be reinvesting to process kind of more lighter-end products? I guess, how do you think about that across your whole global portfolio given where U.S. domestic natural gas prices are and the advantage feedstock you have here now.\nMichael Wirth: U.S. ethane crackers have a nice advantage right now over other U.S. feedstock alternatives and also over other European or Asian naptha crackers. CP Chemicals, U.S. assets can crack a lot of ethane. They're really geared towards a gas feedstock and they are differentially advantaged in that regard versus other U.S. competitors who, as a group, have lower ability to crack ethane. What we see right now are the light crackers are really running full and derivatives out of those units can compete pretty favorably in export markets, and those markets have been growing. So I think in the near term, we certainly see strong utilization and really good performance out of our existing assets. The question as to whether or not there's a long-term sustained investment case for new capacity is a different question. And I think that's one that we need to see more evidence on the long-term sustainability and cost structure in the shale gas industry in this country and it is one that's being watched very closely. I would say the near-term effects have been very positive for light crackers. And the question about future investment is one that is clearly on people's minds. But I don't know that I'm ready to say anything more than that at this point.\nFaisel Khan: If you're looking at your global portfolio, have you shifted more production in the U.S. away from other parts of the world because of this lower feedstock environment?\nMichael Wirth: Well, if you were to look at the portfolio x the start-up and gutter that I talked about and you see the stronger utilization in the U.S., I think the answer to that would be yes. But we do have the new capacity that's coming on in the Middle East, which is a very large -- it's a 1.3 million ton per annum cracker. And so I think net net, you wouldn't necessarily see that shift because of the impact of the new capacity in the Middle East.\nFaisel Khan: An upstream question if I can. Just give us -- repeat your comments on Jack/St. Malo. Did you say you would or would not book reserves at the end of this year?\nPatricia Yarrington: We will not be booking reserves at the end of this year.\nFaisel Khan: And then what's the status of Big Foot?\nPatricia Yarrington: We're still hopeful it's going to FID before the end of this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: You guys have been pretty much the only company in your peer group to stay away from North American shale gas, and I don't think anybody would fall through for that at all. My question is what would you like to see change before pulling the trigger on some of those opportunities or if they just completely off the table for the foreseeable future?\nPatricia Yarrington: We're not opposed to shale because it's shale gas. I think we have expressed that because we've been out picking up acreage in Canada and Poland and Romania. What we have been trying to do is have a very cost-effective entry point, and we have not found that to be the case in the U.S. market. That's not to say that, that will never be the case but we haven't found it to be the case right now. As you know, there are lot of -- there's a lot of spread between quality of shale properties and so it really is important, the asset quality that you're acquiring.\nPavel Molchanov: In your European shale opportunities, I guess Poland in particular, what kind of timeline do you see for development into 2011 in terms of how many rigs you'll allocate, et cetera?\nPatricia Yarrington: I don't have the full plan on that. We're just in the acquiring seismic, shooting seismic at this point in time. It's just very early days for Poland.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Harlan [ph] (1:03:04) with Societe Generale.\nUnidentified Analyst: With the sales at Colonial Pipeline, will you be booking a gain? And if so, how much?\nPatricia Yarrington: Will be booking a gain. We'll indicate it when we get to it on our interim update. But certainly, it will be a material item for us and we'll call it out.\nUnidentified Analyst: With Jack/St. Malo, I know you're not going to be booking any reserves. But regarding the development, are you going to be frac-ing the wells before you flow them, or are you going to flow them and then frac them?\nPatricia Yarrington: That sounds like a great question for George. We'll have to get back to you on that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Last one for me, you're just starting back up again in the Gulf of Mexico. Things are going to go slow. The BOEM said that cost would rise for the industry, about $183 million. I know it's probably too early to assess but I was wondering, time-wise, whether you thought it would be kind of a 2012 event or a late 2011 event before you get a kind of PD sense of how projects will be effective for you?\nPatricia Yarrington: I think we're going to watch this as it unfolds. What I would say is that a lot of the recommended changes in procedures and process, Chevron already had and was operating through a very high standard and already had those costs essentially as part of our way of doing business. So while there could be some incremental cost, I think of it in terms of delay and a little bit of overhead burden, than really anything more substantial than that. When we look at our projects, of course, we take into account a variety of scenarios on commodity prices but also on cost. And our view of this cost increment that may come from the moratorium will be very small and certainly well within the bounds of the project economics that we already evaluate.\nOperator: I'm not showing any other questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn it over to Pat Yarrington for closing comments.\nPatricia Yarrington: All right. Well, I want to thank everybody for being on the call today. We do appreciate everyone's participation and I especially want to thank the analysts who -- on behalf of all the participants,  for their questions. Thanks very much. I appreciate your interest in Chevron. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Third  Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-07-30 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington.\nPatricia Yarrington: Thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President of Global Upstream and Gas; Jeanette Ourada, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2010. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement here on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The second quarter earnings were $5.4 billion or $2.70 per diluted share. Our second quarter 2010 earnings more than tripled compared with the year-ago quarter. Second quarter 2010 earnings increased 19% compared to the first quarter of 2010, which Jeanette will discuss shortly in more detail. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. The debt ratio was 9.5% with cash balances exceeding debt balances by $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter. Jeanette will take us now through the quarterly comparisons. Jeanette?\nJeanette Ourada: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 4. I will compare results of the second quarter 2010 with the first quarter 2010. As a reminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter earnings increased about $850 million from the first quarter. Upstream earnings were $180 million lower due to unfavorable tax charges and higher OpEx, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency variance. Second quarter downstream results saw a significant improvement of nearly $780 million. Earnings benefited from stronger U.S. margins, favorable foreign currency and timing variances, as well as the absence of first quarter charges related to planned employee reductions. The other bar largely reflects a favorable swing in corporate tax items and lower corporate charges. On Slide 5, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $66 million lower than the first quarter's results. Realizations in the second quarter were down $95 million. Natural gas realizations drove the decline, dropping 24%, slightly higher than the 20% decline in Henry Hub spot prices. U.S. crude oil realizations were essentially flat between quarters. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by $40 million between periods, primarily due to downtime and normal field declines in the Gulf of Mexico. The other bar represents a benefit of $69 million, which is comprised of a number of unrelated items including lower DD&A rates and exploration expenses. Turning to Slide 6. International upstream earnings were down $116 million compared with the first quarter. Higher realizations benefited earnings by $70 million. Liquids realizations rose 2% between quarters, in line with the increase in average Brent Spot Prices. Natural gas realizations were a slight offset, declining 5% between periods. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $210 million. First quarter results included a $100 million loss that was effectively offset by a $110 million gain in the second quarter. An unfavorable swing in tax items across multiple jurisdictions decreased earnings $220 million. Second quarter charges of about $120 million effectively offset a $100 million earnings benefit in the first quarter. OpEx increased $120 million in the second quarter, which included higher turnaround costs in Kazakhstan and Canada. The other bar reflects higher exploration expenses and DD&A rates. Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Production decreased 37,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price changes had a modest effect on volumes under production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts in the second quarter, about 3,000 barrels per day. Base business production decreased 47,000 barrels per day between quarters, largely due to planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and Canada, partially offset by higher demand-driven production in Thailand. Incremental production from major capital projects increased second quarter production by 13,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by the continued ramp-up at Frade in Brazil. George will discuss our current year production outlook in a few minutes. Turning to Slide 8. U.S. downstream earnings improved $350 million in the second quarter. Indicator margins strengthened between quarters, increasing earnings by $170 million. Refining margins improved from the depressed levels of the last several quarters. Actual margin capture from advantageous crude mix and product yields increased earnings by an additional $90 million. Chemical results were $50 million higher mainly due to improved margins for olefins and aromatics. The absence of an employee severance charge recorded in the first quarter benefited earnings by $50 million. The other bar is a negative variance of $9 million. On Slide 9, international downstream earnings also improved significantly, increasing about $430 million from first quarter's results. Margins were $45 million higher with improvements in Europe partly offset by declines in Asia. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $230 million. First quarter included a $100 million loss compared to a $130 million gain in the second quarter. Timing effects represented a $155 million positive variance between quarters, reflecting favorable mark-to-market effects on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions. WTI prices dropped about $8 per barrel from the beginning to the end of the quarter. The absence of a $100 million employee severance charge recorded in the first quarter also benefited earnings. The other bar is comprised of several unrelated items, including planned maintenance impacts at our Cape Town refinery in South Africa. Slide 10 covers All Other. Second quarter net charges were $108 million compared to a net $368 million charge in the first quarter, a decline of $260 million between quarters. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $220 million variance. Corporate charges were lower in the second quarter and included the absence of a $25 million severance charge related to workforce reductions recognized earlier in the year. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. George is now going to provide an update on our upstream business. George?\nGeorge Kirkland: Thank you, Jeanette. It's good to be back to discuss upstream performance and our production outlook for the remainder of the year. I'm very pleased with our progress in the first half of 2010, especially around our safety and production performance. Let's begin by looking at our second quarter competitive position on earnings margins. Please turn to Slide 12. In the first quarter, our adjusted earnings per barrel were $19.50, over $3 higher than our nearest competitor.  In the second quarter, upstream margins were $18.74, another excellent quarter, reinforcing the strength of our oil-weighted portfolio and the quality of the new projects we're bringing online. Based on competitor results disclosed this week, we have sustained our competitive advantage. We led our nearest competitor by over $4 per barrel this quarter, and this is our fourth consecutive quarter in the top position on this metric. Now I'll turn to production. Please turn to Slide 13. Our first half production averaged 2.76 million barrels a day at an average WTI price of $78 per barrel. At the fourth quarter call in January, we set full year production guidance at 2.73 million barrels a day based on the 2009 actual price of $62 a barrel. Using the same price basis, our year-to-date production would be 60,000 barrels a day higher than the original guidance. Remember, a portion of our net production is sensitive to price through entitlements. At current oil prices, this is about 2,000 barrels a day for every dollar price change. Our full year production outlook at year-to-date prices of $78 per barrel is 2.75 million barrels a day, almost 2% higher than 2009 levels.  At $62 per barrel, this translates to 2.78 million barrels a day or about 3% growth, significantly higher than our original guidance of 1%. The higher growth forecast is driven by stronger base business performance, our focus on reliability and system optimization, as well as increased gas sales in Thailand. Our annual base business decline is now estimated to be in the 4% to 5% range. Incremental production for major capital projects remains close to the original forecast. Most projects are performing as planned. Better performance has been seen at SGI/SGP in Kazakhstan, Frade in Brazil and Mafumeira Norte in Angola. This improved performance is offset by delays at some non-operated projects, particularly Perdido in the Deep Water Gulf of Mexico and the first expansion of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Canada. Now please turn to Slide 14. I would like to spend a moment to discuss the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf and the follow-on impact on our operations. First, our deepest sympathies go out to the families of the 11 individuals who lost their lives and also to others along the Gulf Coast impacted by this tragedy. We are very pleased that this well has been successfully capped. The drilling moratorium has impacted our offshore Gulf of Mexico operations in several ways. We expect some lost production in 2010 due to permitting delays on the shelf and a slower ramp-up at Perdido. The full year impact is expected to be less than 10,000 barrels a day. When the moratorium was implemented, we were completing a Tahiti development well and drilling the Buckskin appraisal and Moccasin exploration wells. The Tahiti well is due to come online soon, but other development drilling activity is now on hold. Buckskin and Moccasin operations are suspended, and our other two planned deep water exploration wells are delayed, negatively impacting our 2010 exploration program. We have three deep water rigs on contract. One is currently working for BP to assist in the spill response. The other two are on stand-by, waiting for approval to resume drilling operations. Although the longer term impact of the moratorium remains unknown, we are focused on progressing our projects in the Deep Water Gulf of Mexico. The Tahiti II, Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot projects remain on track to reach FID later this year, assuming the moratorium is lifted. Chevron is a leader in safety performance, and we're very confident in our abilities to safely drill and develop our deep water projects. Our safety and environmental focus is to prevent incidents from occurring. We believe the investigations of this tragedy will show that it was preventable. We are participating in joint industry taskforces, working with the National Commission to determine the appropriate path forward on drilling safety, with particular attention on prevention, containment and spill response. The Gulf of Mexico and other deep water basins remain very important in meeting the energy demands of the U.S. and the world. A continuation of the suspension of operations in the Gulf of Mexico will reduce supply and influence energy prices. We believe the moratorium should be lifted, and we believe that deep water drilling can be done safely and reliably. Turning to Slide 15, I'd now like to discuss some of our significant achievements during the second quarter. First, a short update on Gorgon. We continue to make good progress. Site preparations are under way, dredging has begun, the construction camp is being built and we have awarded over $24 billion in contracts. As a reminder, we have signed sales and purchase agreements for approximately 90% of the equity LNG offtake from the Gorgon trains one through three. We recently signed a Heads of Agreement with KOGAS for delivery of almost 2 million tons per annum of LNG from the Wheatstone project. KOGAS will also acquire a 5% equity interest in the project. This is another successful step in early capture of market share for this project. We now have approximately 80% of LNG offtake from Wheatstone's train one and two tied to long-term agreements. Also in Australia, we have announced two deep water natural gas discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin, Clio-3 and Sappho-1, moving us closer towards our goal of additional LNG trains at Gorgon and Wheatstone. I'm very pleased with our continued exploration success in Australia. In Indonesia, we sanctioned the 13th expansion of the Duri Field, where we have 100% working interest. This latest expansion will leverage existing steam and production facilities to increase production from the field by approximately 20,000 barrels a day. We've made good progress in capturing new opportunities. In the unconventional shale gas area, we have captured 675,000 acres in Romania and almost 200,000 acres in Western Canada. We expect to begin appraisal of the Canadian acreage by the end of 2011. As a reminder, we recently added 1 million acres in Poland. In Venezuela, we have formed a consortium that will work toward developing the Carabobo 3 heavy oil project in the Orinoco belt. And in Russia, we have signed a Heads of Agreement with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil company, to pursue a deep water opportunity on the Shatsky Ridge in the Russian portion of the Black Sea. In summary, I'm very pleased with our accomplishments in the second quarter and the first half of this year. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Pat.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay. Thanks, George. Turning to Slide 16, I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks with a recap of Chevron's strategic progress through the first half of the year. Strong operational momentum continued in the second quarter and our safety performance remains at record level. The Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico has heightened investor interest in operators' safety and environmental records. We're very proud of our safety culture and our industry-leading performance in this area. We publish historical statistics annually in our corporate responsibility report, which you can find on our website. Our businesses are continuing to run well. Our major refineries are operating reliably and upstream production efficiency remains at a high level, which contributed to our strong first-half production performance. We are sustaining our cost management efforts. For the first half of the year, excluding one-time employee severance charges, operating and SG&A expenses were up 5% versus the comparable period in 2009. Half was related to higher fuel and transportation costs. The remainder is in line with a 4% production increase over the same period. As George mentioned, our upstream business is growing and growing at an industry-leading level of profitability. He also highlighted several new opportunities that expand our set of portfolio options to continue to grow our resource base. In the downstream, we are executing our restructuring plan. Portfolio [ph] exits (27:54) and market reviews are under way, and specific actions are being taken to de-cost our operations. We anticipate the new organizational structure will be in place by the end of the third quarter. The same drivers expanding upstream earnings margins are contributing to our robust cash position. After paying dividends and funding our capital program, we generated about $2 billion of cash flow in the second quarter. This strong cash flow and a low net debt position, allow us to maintain our financial strength and flexibility. I'd like to close with a few words on capital intensity. It's a frequently heard question that I believe should be laid to rest. We have invested more than $60 billion in upstream in the last four years. We've brought on many major capital projects during this period that grew production 7% last year alone, and production is still growing. And we've had the highest earnings per barrel now for four consecutive quarters and the gap is large. This should be solid proof that our investments are attractive. We're expanding at the right parts of our portfolio. We are making the right choices on individual projects and we have shown that we can profitably grow. Looking forward, we're headed into another period not unlike the last four years. We're taking on world-class projects to reap the production and cash rewards when those projects come online in the middle of the decade. We are very comfortable with this profile as we have proven that disciplined capital intensity is a good thing, if the projects are the right projects and you can afford it. They are and we can. Now that concludes our prepared remarks. I will now take on your questions. So Sean, I'd ask that you open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from [ph] Robert Kessler (30:18) with Simmons & Company.\nUnidentified Analyst: Firstly, just a general question for you, George, on your perceptions of the current upstream M&A market, in particular with respect to possible, more substantial additions to the Chevron portfolio. And then, secondly, with regard to your confidence in reaching FID on projects in the Gulf of Mexico later this year, notwithstanding the need for the moratorium to be lifted, I'd be curious on your thoughts on two points. Firstly, even beyond the lifting of the moratorium, it seems we need some confidence in understanding what the new sort of technical-regulatory environment will be, what's required for a development well going forward. And secondly, with respect to your thoughts on the higher cap or an unlimited cap on liabilities in the Gulf of Mexico.\nGeorge Kirkland: M&A's going to be the standard answer. We always are looking for opportunities that are inorganic, if you will, but they've got to compete, they've got to make economic sense for us. The market's still been very hot. People, I think, are [ph] overpaying (31:36). And once again, it's back to returns. We believe in returns. So it's got to be -- return basis has got to fit with our portfolio. It's got to be a bump on our returns. On the Gulf of Mexico, the technical work, we are moving it forward as if the moratorium is going to be released, removed. We do not know all the changes on the technical requirements. We've been leading a task force that did make recommendations that would raise the industry standards on drilling wells. I will tell you, most all those standard improvements are raising the bar, if you will; we presently do in our drilling operations. Now we don't know the individual procedural changes, engagement with government that will be required. We are waiting to see that but we're drilling wells around the world. We have seen higher engagement with other governments. It does have some minor impact on the time it takes to drill a well but it is not significant. Once again, our confidence is very high at being able to drill these wells safely, just like we've drilled hundreds of other deep water wells. So we think it's going to move forward. Now with regards to the liability cap. It's an issue that we can understand, why governments would want to increase it. But at the same time, if it gets too high, it won't impact companies necessarily like a Chevron except in our decision making. But for our competitor group and the broad span of the competitors, some of them may not be able to participate. We believe competition is good. And if you set the liability cap too high, there's a lot of companies that will not be able to participate and we don't believe that's a good thing. It may be a competitive advantage but we don't believe it is a good thing for the industry, for consumers, so we don't support it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDouglas Leggate: I guess, the first one is kind of an upstream and a capital question. George, as it relates to your comments on the underlying decline, I seem to recall several quarters ago you talked about how in the current gas price environment, you would probably slow the base spending and that might accelerate your decline rate a little bit. It doesn't appear that that's happening. Can you give some color around what has changed there that is allowing you to hold the base a little better? And the related question is, given that you've, I guess, the capital spending for the year-to-date looks a little bit on the light side. We're getting into the second half, we're starting to look at FIDs for the longer-term projects. Can you give us an early look as to why your capital is not quite running at the rate you suggested at the strategy day and what perhaps the outlook might be for 2011. That would be great.\nGeorge Kirkland: Okay. The decline rate, you're absolutely correct, we did I guess say that there was a potential for a higher decline rate as we reduced some of our expenditures in the base business, particularly in 2009. We also pulled back, like you said, on some of our gas investments and preferentially moved more or as much as we could towards oil. Our success on keeping that decline rate in this 4% to 5% has been very good. It really is all related to the reliability and the production efficiency of our operations. We have seen production efficiency -- which really is reliability -- of our operations come up by about 2%. So what we thought we were going to lose on decline rate has been overcome by greater efficiency, greater reliability in our base business operations. And frankly, we are extremely pleased with that. That's great for efficiency of money spent. That's getting more barrels and not spending -- base, when you get it from the base and you're not having to spend much more money for it, it is really good margin barrels. Now on the capital spend rate. In the upstream, we're very close to our typical spend profile for the year. We are almost dead on our target when you look at the last four years of history on how we would spend our money. So my expectation is, we will spend our capital. I think there is even a chance that we will be a little bit higher on spend in the upstream than what we had said initially. Not significantly, but we've added a few opportunities that we mentioned this morning that will require some monies in 2010. And that will likely push our capital spend for the year slightly above what we told you in March.\nDouglas Leggate: Can I [ph] risk (37:21) a follow-up for Pat. Just kind of a related but also an adjacent question. The share buyback program has been reloaded to an unlimited number it looks like, and with the amount of cash in the balance sheet I'm curious as to why no share buybacks in Q3? And if you could also address the tax rate, which looked a little light for this quarter. And I'll leave it there.\nPatricia Yarrington: On the share repurchases, we were facing the expiration of the three-year program. And while we indicated in the press release that we're not looking to inaugurate one at this point in time, we wanted to retain the flexibility for having that option on a go-forward basis. Basically, George, I think, answered your question about why not inaugurating it now because he mentioned about having a higher spend profile, a typical higher second-half spend profile in C&E and that's really what's coloring our view right now. On the effective tax rate, I think the best way to look at this is on a year-to-date basis. And foreign exchange was over, or about half of the variance in the year-to-date 2010 versus year-to-date 2009 time period. So foreign exchange comes through. It's balance sheet translation, it's not cash effect. It is not tax-affected either. So when you have big swings in foreign exchange, you get big swings in your effective tax rate. The other activity going on there really relates to just jurisdictional changes.\nDouglas Leggate: Would you give us [ph] a thought (39:07) about a run rate, perhaps, for the underlying tax rate?\nPatricia Yarrington: I think the best way to look at it is over a long period of time. We've been a little bit lower this year than we were in 2009. So maybe on average for 2010, we may be a little bit lower, but it's not an area I want to get into predicting.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: My first question is on Wheatstone. With 80% of the gas under contract, I mean, are you targeting a higher percentage closer to 90% for Gorgon? Is there any sell-down interest in the project contemplated? And with the [ph] HUAs (39:56) closer to done, can you discuss other hurdles for the project here before you reach FID in 2011? And are you trending ahead of schedule? That's the way it would look to me.\nGeorge Kirkland: There was a couple of questions there where I thought -- I wasn't sure all of them were Wheatstone, or there sounded like there was a Gorgon question, but I think when I answer it if I don't come back and redirect, [ph] I'd (40:19) be happy to get clarification. Our target on Wheatstone on gas on long-term basis sales is 90%, just like what we did in Gorgon. We believe 90% gives us the flexibility to deal with any operational issues and meet our contractual requirements. So we're 80%. At Wheatstone, we're very, very close. That gives us a lot of confidence that we can move forward. What I'm telling you then is the market, where we stand in the market, it will not be the constraint going forward on Wheatstone. So we've fulfilled predominantly our goals on getting gas sold into the long-term market. Now these are HOAs. They only become Sales and Purchase Agreements when we reach FID. I believe the project is moving forward in the FEED process, very much on schedule. We would like to accelerate it, if it's possible. We will not accelerate it, though, unless it is ready. It's back to the discipline. Being ready to execute is absolutely critical for all these big projects. A big hurdle for us is environmental permit. Just like environmental permits were needed on Gorgon, we must have those in place on Wheatstone. We've made good progress on the land tenure piece of it where the plant would be located. So overall we're very, very pleased with our progress. We're clicking off all the milestones that we need to and we're pushing to move it forward as quickly as we can. But once again, with all the discipline in being able to execute.\nEvan Calio: My second question. Production's been higher, yet I was curious if you could give us more color on the driver of $120 million incremental international OpEx? Is that cost inflation, maintenance or turnaround expense? And does that impact any kind of go-forward thoughts?\nGeorge Kirkland: I think most of it is related to our turnarounds. We had big turnarounds at Athabasca, we had big turnarounds at the KTL units in, that's our standard, that's a lot of our facilities in Tengiz. So I think it's heavily related to that. Our second and third quarters typically are our biggest quarters on turnarounds. Quarters one and quarters four are not. That's generally related to weather. It's a better time for us typically to do our turnarounds in quarters two and three. So I think that explains most of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.\nEdward Westlake: A couple of upstream questions. On the accident, you said you believed it's preventable. So you could continue drilling and the technical regulations are all within, Chevron's already included. So I guess the question is, is there anything that you're hearing out of Washington that could change your view that once the moratorium is over, that you could go back into the Gulf, [ph] I'm (43:48) thinking requirements to drill relief wells or changes to BOPs.\nGeorge Kirkland: Once again, I hate to speculate on what the requirements could be. The recommendations made by two of the DOI, from the task force, from the industry task force on improving drilling operations, once again, we do most all of those practices already. We don't know what's going to come out from the government as a requirement. And until we know that, it's really hard to speak beyond that. Drilling and starting a second -- or starting a relief well, when you're drilling the first well, we don't support. We think it increases risk. Here, you're exposing yourself to two drilling operations at once. So we, frankly, from a risk profile and a probability basis, don't understand that concept. We don't think it makes sense. Once again, we can't and I don't think we should speculate on what's going to come out. We've made recommendations. We believe the bar should be raised for everyone in industry and we need to have assurances, and I think the government and the public should have assurances that all operations in the industry are being done safely.\nEdward Westlake: And then a follow-up back to Australia. You've got, obviously, success in your own exploration efforts and you've got two large LNG projects that could be expanded. What's your thoughts in terms of accepting third-party gas because obviously the industry is discovering gas near your own facilities as well?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, in the case of Gorgon, we really don't think that we have any additional land availability to build more trains on Barrow Island to accept any gas beyond what the Gorgon partnership will be able to develop. We believe there can be five trains put on Barrow Island. We believe at this point, at least I believe, we have enough gas already for the fourth train. I didn't say I had all the partners on board in that but I believe that. And we still have exploration opportunities in the Gorgon partnership. On Wheatstone, I'll take you back and remind everyone that we have already brought third-party gas into that development. That's Apache and KUFPEC, and their discoveries; they will be a part of Wheatstone development. They have a 25% working interest in the plant there. So in these first two trains, we have already bought third-party gas. We see Wheatstone as a hub. It's a hub to bring in our gas and other industry gas. We've set the commercial arrangements in a way to attract third-party gas. We believe that we have enough area on the site for up to six trains. So we have a, I think, a view that we will make this a hub with our gas and others' gas, and make it attractive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: George, you mentioned Romania and Canada on conventional gas acreage, but generally speaking, you are underweight I guess in the unconventional gas and [ph] effect (47:34) oil theme, particularly in the lower 48. Could you just talk a little bit about, whether this is sort of you dabbling or how attractive you find the overall theme relative to the rest of your portfolio?\nGeorge Kirkland: We like unconventional gas where we can make reasonable returns. And I almost would characterize it simply as that. We've got a position in the Piceance in the United States, a position in the Haynesville in East Texas. We've drilled wells there. We know how to get the gas out of the ground efficiently. We know how to drill the wells. So we understand it very well. We would have -- these are good positions. They don't presently make development sense because the gas price and the market conditions with oversupply in the U.S. just doesn't make it attractive. Those developments, our own developments that we presently hold with -- and once again, on both of these, we don't have a royalty we have to pay in the Piceance, and these are held by production acreage in East Texas -- so what we really need is a market that needs the gas. And then we think there will be very good returns there. We don't see in the U.S. in most cases, an opportunity to pay the land rentals, the royalty rates that you see in the U.S. and make a competitive investment. That's why we're looking outside the United States to apply the same technology, to look for an organic exploration-type development opportunity that we can then, with low entry cost, develop and supply gas to market in those locations.\nPaul Sankey: And Pat, if I could to you, I think you pretty clearly stated that you didn't buy back or you decided not to buy back in Q3 because you expect a step up in CapEx, wherefore causing you to have another couple of billion dollars of free cash flow in Q3. Would it be reasonable then to expect, knowing your priorities regarding AA rating and everything else, that you would be buying back shares by Q4, assuming our forecast of the excess cash flow is correct for Q3?\nPatricia Yarrington: Paul, I'll leave you to do the forecasting and I'm not going to commit here to a fourth quarter share repurchase program. I will tell you that it will look at the whole host of things: the capital program, industry costs, what's happening in the global economic environment, what's happening to downstream margins. We'll look across the whole gamut of variables that we try to manage here. And when we see ourselves in a position where, after the dividend grows and a good, strong capital program, and keeping the balance sheet, if we see ourselves in a position where we've got surplus cash being generated for a reasonably longer term period of time, that's when we will look to reinstate a share repurchase program.\nPaul Sankey: So we shouldn't characterize the cash build as a war chest, then.\nPatricia Yarrington: No. I wouldn't characterize the cash build as anything other than a cash build.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Gilman with Benchmark Capital.\nMark Gilman: I had a couple questions for George, if I could, please. First, with respect to the contracts on Gorgon and the heads of agreement, George, on Wheatstone. Can you give me a rough idea what percentage of those agreements are accrued length in terms of the price structure?\nGeorge Kirkland: My memory is, all are price-linked to crude. We've indexed everything to crude. And I'll give you a little more [ph] piece (51:43) on what we've said consistently, at very close to oil parity.\nMark Gilman: Second question relates to the U.S. liquids production number, which, at least to me, even taking into consideration the Perdido delays, looks awfully weak. Is blind fate declining or is there some other reason that we're seeing the fall-off there versus the first quarter in particular being fairly sharp?\nGeorge Kirkland: Yes, the fall-off in the second quarter is heavily related to Hurricane Alex disruption. It impacted our Gulf of Mexico operations by about 20,000 barrels per day in the second quarter.\nMark Gilman: Barrels per day or barrel equivalents per day, George?\nGeorge Kirkland: Barrel equivalents but it's heavily barrels, particularly anything in the deep water. The Deep Water piece is, Tahiti, Blind Faith, all of those projects, once again are predominantly oil.\nMark Gilman: Blind Faith holding plateau?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, Blind Faith is producing. It is coming down. It is coming down as expected. It's in line with what we planned and what we forecasted.\nMark Gilman: Just one more, George. Duri. Believe it or not, I can recall when the 12-phase steam flood was the target. You're now sanctioning a 13th phase. Is there something new there that you've identified and is there the potential for a whole other set of phases alongst the lines of the program that was in place some years ago?\nGeorge Kirkland: I would characterize this is more just a further extension to the north end of the field. And we probably will see maybe one, at least, one more area extension. We're looking at another area that we can develop. You always see these big fields get a little bit bigger and you drill some more wells and you find the reservoir looks good, at least good enough to take the next step and do the steam operation. That's what's happening here. Area 12 has been very successful. So it gives us a lot of confidence in stepping out to Area 13. I hope I come back in another year or two and talk about 14.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng: George, if we're looking at over the last several years, I think, it seems like there's a change in view on the oil sands within Chevron. I think at one point you guys are pretty excited, snap up a lot of land position and then that has been relatively quiet since then, with the exception of the ESOP development, the upgrade, the expansion. Can you share with us then what's your view on the oil sand dunes? Do you think that, stacking up, they are not looking that great comparing to your rest of your portfolio so you are not too interested in dramatically expanding your exposure, or that this an area that you guys looking at?\nGeorge Kirkland: Paul, I think actually our view on oil sands has been pretty consistent. We did, through some crown-lease acquisitions, obtain some acreage up there and assessed it for in situ steam operations. But we've done that work and our view of the oil sands all along has been that it's kind of the part of the portfolio or the industry portfolio that sets almost the marginal price. It is high cost. We have other opportunities that supersede it. We do expect that we'll be back into what we obtained down the road, it's at Ells River. We've done the assessment and we fit it into the queue. It just sits at the back of the queue in recognition of other opportunities in front of it. And I would characterize all the oil sands projects that way. They are a little bit narrower in margin and they need higher prices to make them economic.\nPaul Cheng: George, since earlier, you're talking about Duri, the steam fronting. Can you give us an update, how's the pilot steam [indiscernible] (56:33) your neutral zone?\nGeorge Kirkland: Yes, in the partition zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, we've had the steam flood pilot there in operation for about a year now. We are seeing some temperature climb in the reservoirs. We can see that in our observation wells. It's encouraging. It's early. We expect within the next 18 months to have a pretty good read on the reservoir response. So I think we're about 18 months away from really telling you something that's really meaningful. I'll just end and say, we're encouraged. We're encouraged by what we're seeing on temperature response. And of course, we're encouraged because there's 12-plus billion barrels of oil in place that we're looking at there.\nPaul Cheng: Two final questions. One, there's again having some rumor coming out talking about Kazakhstan government going to snap Tengiz with the export tax. This is probably the ten times in the last six or seven years. I'm wondering is there any official communication between you guys and Kazakhstan Government on that? The last question is that, if we look at in the Gulf of Mexico, Jack/St. Malo, the Big Foot look like I think those probably target start-up maybe some time in 2014, 2015. If the memorandum of the Duri [indiscernible] (57:59) extend beyond November, how long then, the Duri [indiscernible] (58:06) extend, up to what day you would start to see there's a risk on those start-up days?\nGeorge Kirkland: First, let me talk about Tengiz and statements out there. And I'm going to cover a couple items. You've seen a media statement about the mining allotment. The mining allotment for us is very clear in our contract. We have all rights of all subsalt. Everything below the salt in the Tengiz geographical area. We have rights to that, we have contractual rights. It's very straightforward in our contract. The media statement, the media words you've seen out there on the export customs duty, there is reports of that. I will tell you, we've had some communication with the government on that point. Once again, our contract, I think, is very straightforward on custom duties like that. They would be offsetable. And I'll just leave that piece of it at that point, at this point. I had two other things related to Tengiz. First off, operationally, Tengiz is running extremely well. We're very, very happy with SGI/SG performance and the existing facilities. And then maybe one last point, our long-term relationship with the government of Kazakhstan, with our partners there, has been very good. We've been there 18 years. We've had disagreements that we've always worked through very well. I think it translates to our good performance. As a group, we've done well. That doesn't mean we haven't had times where we had discussions and had to work through things. And I believe we will see the same thing here. Our relationships will carry us. Our performance for these 18 years, I think really underscores that we can work there and that we can work together very well with the government and our partners.\nPaul Cheng: George, how about in the Gulf of Mexico?\nGeorge Kirkland: Sorry. When you give me these multiple questions, it sometimes \u2013 Gulf of Mexico, I would tell you, if the moratorium is still held, is still on us post-November or -December, it will start impacting the schedule. We cannot move forward on these projects without knowing clearly what the expectations are. So at some point, it's going to start pushing the startup date of these projects. We think we're in pretty good shape up until November. We've done FEED work. We've positioned ourselves with bids on contracts. So we've done all the engineering and preparatory work to be able to move forward into execution. If this keeps sliding out in the unknowns, it will delay the projects. And frankly, for not only us, but for government and others, it will impact revenue streams, crude availability. These are all very large projects. Remember, Jack/St. Malo is a roughly 120,000 to 150,000 barrel a day oil development. So very significant projects.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.\nFaisel Khan: Can you give us a little bit of an update on exploration? Any major discoveries in the second quarter, or significant ones. And what your plans are for the third quarter here and the fourth quarter?\nGeorge Kirkland: Okay, I tried to give a little bit of that in my prepared statement so I'll try to take that and then maybe expand a little bit. We are, and I'll start off with the impacts. Our program in the Deep Water Gulf of Mexico has been impacted significantly. We were on the Buckskin appraisal well and that was a very significant well for us. We wanted that one drilled, where we could accelerate potential development of that prospect. We really think it's that good, that that appraisal well would define an awful lot if it would go forward. We've had three other deep water wells in the Gulf of Mexico that we wanted to drill. We were actually on the Moccasin well when the suspension of operations occurred. We had two other deep water Gulf of Mexico wells, very large prospects, that have now been delayed. So from that perspective, a big part of our program in exploration was these impact, greater-than-100-million-barrel resource-size prospects. Those have been eliminated from the program this year. So that's worrying, that's delaying, but we don't have any choice. That's where we are on that. Elsewhere in the world, our other deep water drilling is moving forward and other exploration wells around the world are moving forward. We're drilling the [ph] Lona (1:03:43) well up in the East Coast of Canada. That well spudded shortly after the moratorium and after the spill in the Gulf of Mexico started. So that well is getting closer to our [ph] objective (1:03:57) section. We've made good progress there. I hope by the fourth quarter, third quarter call, we will be able to tell you more there. Successes have been strong in Australia. We're drilling a large number of wells in that focus area. We continue to have great success there. We're focused on Australia in the Carnarvon Basin because not only are the discoveries significant, if we have those discoveries then they also move quickly to expansions of the LNG projects that we're doing there. So we have strong focus there. We're putting a lot of money into Australia to try to get to the next step on the expansions of those projects. We've got a well that we'll be drilling west of Shetlands in the second half. Another significant well, we call it [indiscernible] (1:04:53). So we've got several other high-impact wells. But bottom line, the scale of our exploration program has been significantly impacted this year because of the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico.\nFaisel Khan: And then just one question on the downstream portion. Can you give me an idea of what the absolute timing effect was in the quarter in the International downstream business? I know you gave us the quarter-over-quarter variance, I was wondering if we could get the absolute number in terms of the timing impact.\nPatricia Yarrington: It's about $100 million.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: Let me just press you a little on Kazakhstan. I appreciate the point you're making about sort of the nature of the language of the contract but of course we know from a lot of places, sanctity of contract is not always respected. So my question is, with Tengiz and Karachaganak, both under investigation this year within just a few months, is it your sense that Kazakhstan might be becoming just a more hostile place for Western operators to do business in?\nGeorge Kirkland: I hate to read into that far. We've had disagreements in the past. We've been there, in the case of TCO, 18 years. We've worked through differences. We have had a very positive relationship with the government. So I am very confident that we will move through this issue. I do look at Karachaganak -- though we're in both of those ventures, I look at them somewhat differently -- I do believe that the claims in the case of Karachaganak, some of the claims that the government's making are things that we have got to deal with in the sense of overexpenditures on projects, as an example. And we are in discussions and negotiations, trying to get to a rational solution there that is appropriate, that recognizes what the issues are from the government side and the issues from the partnership side. So I do, from my perspective, see a difference. I see contractual differences and I see issue differences.\nFaisel Khan: Let me turn quickly to your European shale gas presence. I guess you have about 1 million acres in the Silurian and Poland and then of course you just added Romania. What do you need to see to bring that to full-scale commercialization and, realistically, when might be the timetable for doing that?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, the process is going to be a standard process that we use in our exploration. We will go in and shoot seismic. We'll use this to kind of define the areas of interest better. Then we will go in and drill wells. We'll understand the shale. We will frac the shale. We will actually do a fracture test there and we'll put the gas on production where we can understand rates. So it's normal process. The first work with regards to seismic, we should be doing -- we will be doing seismic in Poland this year and next year. And I expect to be in Poland some time next year also to drilling the first wells. And then, after we drill a few wells, I think we'll have a better idea of the follow-on timing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jacques Rousseau with RBC Capital.\nJacques Rousseau: Just one question from your presentation. On Page 14, where you talked about the deep water rigs on standby. Do you still have to pay the full rate for them or was there some renegotiation of the contracts there?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes, largely, I think it's best to assume that it's largely the full rate. There's a little bit of a discount but it's not a material discount.\nOperator: Our final question comes from John Harland with SG Americas Securities.\nUnidentified Analyst: Three quick ones. How much are you spending overall, George, on unconventional resource activities this year?\nGeorge Kirkland: Right off-hand, I couldn't tell you. It's a combination of lease acquisition. And I probably, frankly, would be very reluctant to tell you exactly that, because you could figure out acquisition cost, and everyone else could figure out acquisition cost. So maybe that's something I can discuss by the time we get there in March, at our March meeting, and we'll portray it in a way that we're not disclosing information that I don't want to, but also we'll kind of give you an idea of how big a bag of money it takes to do what we want to do.\nJacques Rousseau: Next one. In Canada, are you in the Horn River? Is that the shale gas?\nGeorge Kirkland: We're not disclosing the location at this point in time.\nJacques Rousseau: Last one for me. Obviously, with the moratorium in the U.S., your exploration expenses have been running a little bit low versus history. Will the second quarter rate kind of continue going forward?\nGeorge Kirkland: I wish I knew the outcome of wells that I would only drill if we could.\nJacques Rousseau: But I'm just thinking in terms of the [ph] biz (1:10:54) risk profile.\nGeorge Kirkland: The Australia side, the wells we drill in Australia, we continue to have better performance on the risk side than what we come in prior to spudding the well, but it is so hard to forecast that.\nJacques Rousseau: George, I was just asking U.S., I wasn't asking globally.\nGeorge Kirkland: U.S., it's going to make a huge impact. I'm sorry I misunderstood your question. The U.S., we're just not going to have any wells drilled, it looks like, this year.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay. I think that we'll close off here now. First of all, let me just say, I appreciate very much your interest in the company. I appreciate everyone's participation on the call today. And I especially want to thank the analysts on behalf of all the participants for their questions during this morning's session. Thanks very much. Goodbye for now.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-05-03 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia Yarrington: Good morning. Thanks Sean very much. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Jeanette Ourada, General Manager, Investor Relations is on the call with me. Our focus today is on Chevron\u2019s financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2010. We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company\u2019s first quarter earnings were $4.6 billion or $2.27 per diluted share. Our first quarter 2010 earnings increased about 150% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Our upstream business benefited from higher crude oil prices and higher production. Net oil equivalent production was up about 5% from a year ago, due mainly to the ramp up of major capital projects. Downstream earnings were lower, reflecting the absence of 2009 gains on asset sales, as well as 2010 charges related to previously announced employee reductions. First quarter 2010 earnings rose 48% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, which Jeanette will discuss shortly in more detail. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 13%. The debt ratio dropped below 10% at the end of the quarter. And finally, we announced on Wednesday that Chevron\u2019s board of directors approved a $0.04 per share, or 5.9% increase in the common stock quarterly dividend. This follows only nine months after the previous quarterly increase, which was in the third quarter of 2009. Turning to Slide 4, I\u2019ll now compare results of first quarter 2010 with the fourth quarter of 2009. As a reminder, our earnings release compares first quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. First quarter earnings were about $1.5 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Higher crude oil and natural gas realization, as well as lower operating expenses, benefited the company\u2019s worldwide upstream results. Cash from earnings were also higher, most of the result of improved refining margins across all regions and the absence of unfavorable fourth quarter inventory effects. The variance in the other bar reflects slower corporate charges. Earnings in first quarter included charges of $175 million associated with employee reductions and the downstream businesses and corporate staff. As I alerted you in our fourth quarter earnings call, we have done some re-segmentation of reported earnings and I\u2019d like to go through those changes with you now. Starting this year, both our chemicals businesses meaning Oronite Additives and our Chevron Phillips Chemicals joint venture, report to Mike Wirth. Their performance results are now included in the downstream business segment. In addition, certain upstream enabling operations, primarily the Escravos gas to liquids project and major international export pipelines, have been reclassified from the downstream segment to the upstream segment. These upstream enabling assets are fundamental to the success and economics of their related upstream operations. In our judgment, the revised segmentation more appropriately aligns current and future capital allocation decisions with segment performance results and management oversight responsibilities within the company. Prior period information has been conformed accordingly, and for transparency we have footnoted the slides for each impacted segment to provide earnings for the comparable periods using the previous reporting methodology. Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons for each of the business segments. Jeanette?\nJeanette Ourada: Thanks Pat. On Slide 5, our U.S. upstream earnings for the first quarter were $90 million higher than the fourth quarter\u2019s results. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $175 million. Chevron\u2019s average U.S. crude oil realization was up about $3 per barrel between consecutive quarters, slightly more than the increase in the average spot price of West Texas Intermedia. Natural gas realizations increased 25% between quarters, in line with Henry Hub\u2019s spot prices, and represented about half of the positive variance. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by $80 million between periods. This was primarily due to the absence of a favorable royalty settlement recognized in the prior quarter. The other bar is comprised of a number of offsetting items. Turning to Slide 6, international upstream earnings were up about $470 million compared with the fourth quarter. Higher oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $145 million. Average realizations for liquids rose 2%, in line with the increase in Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations were also higher in the first quarter, contributing about $100 million to earnings. This was in part due to retroactive price settlements on long-term natural gas contracts. Operating expenses were down $215 million from the fourth quarter. The reduction in OpEx reflects small reductions across multiple categories and operations. The other bar represents an increase of $113 million, and includes various unrelated components, the largest being a favorable variance in tax items. Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production remained strong in the first quarter and increased 5,000 barrels per day. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts by an estimated 5,000 barrels per day. WTI prices averaged $79 per barrel in the first quarter versus $76 per barrel in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter, each dollar increase in WTI resulted in an 1,800 barrel per day volume reduction. This is in line with the 2009 average rate of roughly 1,500 barrels per day per dollar change in WTI. Base business production decreased 1% or roughly 27,000 barrels per day between quarters. Our sustained focus on reliability and system optimization has yielded favorable gains and minimized declines to date. In addition, as shown in the green bar, incremental production from major capital projects benefited first quarter production by 37,000 barrels per day. Primary drivers were ongoing de-bottlenecking efforts at Tengiz in Kazakhstan and the continued ramp up of major capital projects, most notably at Frade in Brazil and Tombua-Landana and Mafumeira Norte in Angola, where new production wells came online. At this time, it is too early to update our full year production outlook of 2.73 million barrels per day. We have several major turnarounds scheduled for the second and third quarters, and storm effects may come into play later in the year. We are very pleased with the first quarter production levels, and intend to provide another update at the second quarter earnings call. Turning to Slide 8, U.S. downstream results increased more than $400 million in the first quarter, as market conditions improved and our refineries ran well. Indicator margins were up, resulting in a $115 million positive variance. Refining margins strengthened from depressed fourth quarter levels in both the Gulf Coast and West Coast, with Gulf Coast margins increasing almost 50% between periods. Heavy refinery maintenance contributed to the improvement in the quarter. Operating expenses were $145 million lower between periods, in part due to the absence of expenses associated with the fourth quarter planned shutdown at the El Segundo refinery and a non-recurring charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to the exit of certain U.S. east coast markets. We recorded a $50 million severance charge in the first quarter related to previously announced employee reductions. Chemical results were $60 million higher, mainly due to improved margins for olefins and aromatics. Multiple components made up the other bar, including favorable tax and trading variances and a small asset sale gain. On Slide 9, international downstream operations also improved significantly, increasing by about $450 million from the fourth quarter\u2019s results. Higher realized margins improved earnings by $345 million between quarters. This was particularly evident in the Asia Pacific region, where Singapore cracking margins rose by almost 160%. As in the U.S., we recorded a severance charge of $100 million related to previously announced workforce reductions for our international operations. Timing effects resulted in a $170 million positive variance between quarters, primarily due to the absence of negative inventory effects recognized in the fourth quarter. The other bar was a small map benefit for the quarter, reflecting lower operating expense and higher shipping and chemical results. Partially offsetting were unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Slide 10 covers all other. First quarter net charges were $368 million compared to a net $418 million charge in the fourth quarter. A $50 million decrease between quarters is mostly due to favorable variances in tax items and other corporate charges. A $25 million severance charge related to workforce reductions was recognized in the first quarter. Our quarterly guidance range of $250 to $350 million for net charges in the all other segment is still appropriate going forward. Pat will now summarize our operational and strategic progress. Pat?\nPatricia Yarrington: Turning now to Slide 11, let\u2019s start with our operational performance so far in 2010, where we\u2019ve had excellent performance in safety, reliability and production efficiency. Following up on a record year of safety, we\u2019re off to an even better start here in 2010. Our refinery network continued to operate reliably and upstream production efficiency continued to climb, as evidenced by our strong production volumes. Also, our diligence in cost management is continuing to yield positive results. Excluding one time employee severance charges recognized in the first quarter, operating and SG&A expenses were flat between comparable year-to-date periods, sustaining the gains that we realized in 2009. This is against a backdrop of a 5% production increase and the doubling of crude prices across the comparable first quarter periods. We\u2019re pleased with the results from our ongoing cost management efforts. In the upstream, Perdido reached first oil at the end of March. This is the first commercial production from the Lower Tertiary trend in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Full facility capacity is 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In March, we announced that the Discoverer Inspiration, an ultra deepwater drill ship, commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the second state-of-the-art vessel commissioned by Chevron in the last year. Both vessels are designed to Chevron\u2019s specifications and will work on a strong queue of deepwater opportunities. Also in the Gulf of Mexico, we were the apparent successful bidder in a recent lease sale, capturing 19 blocks in the deepwater and 27 blocks in the shelf. Selectively growing our leading position in this very important basin will help advance our robust portfolio of projects. In the downstream, we continue to progress our restructuring plan. Our new organizational structure has been finalized and we\u2019re in the process of filling key positions. We are on track to achieve our 2010 targeted year end workforce reduction of 2,000 employees. We\u2019re also on schedule to complete the previously announced U.S. east coast market exit. Other announced market reviews are underway, and we\u2019ll provide further updates as appropriate. And finally, we generated very strong cash flow in the quarter totaling $2.5 billion after paying the dividend and funding our capital program. Cash generation from the major capital projects started up in the last two years is proving to be very robust. In addition, based on preliminary results, our upstream portfolio\u2019s earnings per barrel continued to outpace our competitors, giving us the leading position among our peer group for the last three quarters, and the gap has widened here in 2010. At the end of the quarter, net debt is once again negative as our cash balances exceed our debt level. Net debt is back to year end 2008 levels. And since 2008, we have grown upstream volumes by an impressive 10%. This growth was self funded and we simultaneously weathered the low point in the commodity cycle while also growing our dividend. We\u2019re executing our strategies well, and they\u2019re paying off. And it\u2019s our intention to, and we are confident that we can, maintain this strong performance momentum. So that concludes our prepared remarks and I\u2019d now like to open it up for your questions. Sean, please open up the line. Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Doug Terreson - ISI Group.\nDoug Terreson: So today, there\u2019s commentary regarding a ban on drilling in new areas in the United States, although it\u2019s not really clear to me exactly what that means. And on this point, with Chevron being one of the more proficient explorers in the Gulf in recent years and I\u2019m sure pretty close to the BP situation, I wanted to see if you could provide any insight into this information, that is, if you have any, and how it changes your exploration plan if at all.\nPatricia Yarrington: As you know, this is breaking news, and let me just say that first of all our operations in the Gulf to date have not been impacted by this incident. We do see the press releases and the media reports this morning that say that existing lease sales that are currently planned, you know, will go ahead. We have no information to the contrary. We haven\u2019t heard anything kind of yes or no on that. You know we\u2019re certain that there will be a full investigation and that a root cause analysis will be done, and that it will be widely shared. And beyond that, we\u2019re not really in a position to go much further with that.\nDoug Terreson: One more question, you guys have obviously done a really good job on cost productivity during the past couple of years and I think your operating expenses were lower by 15% last year alone. And on this point, on Slide 8 you guys talk about how, well it appears that you may have already captured around one third of the $400 million in non-fuel savings in refining that you talked about at the analysts\u2019 meeting, so my question is whether or not this is the correct way to think about it or whether, after normalizing for El Segundo and the one other item that I think Jeanette mentioned, that progress on the cost objective is different. So can you provide color on this item? Is this the correct way to think about the objective?\nPatricia Yarrington: Doug, I think a big piece of improvement is we\u2019re coming off a high fourth quarter expense range. So that\u2019s more I think activity driven. I wouldn\u2019t contribute it to the refining goals that we set for ourselves in March.\nDoug Terreson: And that refers to both of those items that you highlighted on the call?\nPatricia Yarrington: In terms of operating expenses here?\nDoug Terreson: Yes.\nPatricia Yarrington: Right. I mean, we talked about the absence of the planned El Segundo refinery shutdown that occurred in the fourth quarter, so relative to first quarter you\u2019ve got a positive variance there. And we also talked about we took expenses associated with the exit of certain U.S. east coast markets in the fourth quarter. We don\u2019t have those again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: I have a question on the balance sheet and your positive $3 billion free cash flow in the quarter, driving an increase in your cash balance. Can you generally discuss at what cash levels Chevron considers re-initiating buyback or conversely looks to increase CapEx spend on the year? And I have a second question.\nPatricia Yarrington: It\u2019s a great question. I think discussing our cash priorities is always very important. You know really we look at this in terms of our uses of cash the priorities are to increase the dividends, sustain an increase to dividends, we did that. We did it only nine months not a year after the previous increase. You know we then fund C&E. We got a good opportunity set currently underway and a good opportunity set ahead of us, so a big queue of attractive projects. We\u2019d also look to keep our balance sheet healthy so that we can weather commodity price downturns, margin downturns and also keep our flexibility for future opportunities. We look at funding our pension plans as appropriate. And it\u2019s only after we\u2019ve done all of those factors and sort of met those sort of hurdles that we look at share repurchases. So, on a go forward basis in order to re-inaugurate or reinstitute the share repurchase program, we\u2019re going to have to see some cash in excess of our ongoing operating requirements, ongoing working capital requirements; some cash balances that will again allow us to weather any sort of downturn in margins and prices. We\u2019re going to have to see what I would call sustained, positive, surplus cash generation going forward so our outlook would have to suggest that. And I think we\u2019re going to have to have confidence in our ability to be able to sustain a meaningful share repurchase program. We don\u2019t want to be in a position of sort of turning this on and off. And while I\u2019m very pleased with our current balance sheet position and the cash generation from our projects, I\u2019m not in a position to say that I see all of those criteria exactly being met. I think we have a great track record frankly of doing this balance on uses of cash quite well. I think our shareholders have been well rewarded with the choices that we\u2019ve made here, and our intent is to keep making these wise choices going forward.\nEvan Calio: And my second question is a little bit on an Ecuador update. I mean I know you\u2019ve had a lot of progress in the recent quarter and you\u2019ve won in the southern district on the challenge to proceed in The Hague and you were awarded the $700 million subject to a tax determination against Ecuador on an unrelated matter, and I guess I had a few specific questions of what is the path forward in terms of collecting on the award against Ecuador and any idea on maybe timing on your recent motion to strike the expert report in the environmental matter on Lago Agrio and maybe any interplay between the state level actions and the environmental case would be helpful.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay. Well, let me just take them here, hopefully one at a time and see if I can knock those off. In terms of the international arbitration ruling, and for those of you who maybe aren\u2019t quite familiar with that, this is where the international court ruled in favor of Chevron for approximately $700 million in damages and interest related to a long standing set of commercial claims. And they found that that Ecuador court had violated international law, basically through delays and rulings on certain disputes between Texaco and the Ecuadorian government. The case is separate from the Lago Agrio case. In terms of next steps about collecting on that, I wouldn\u2019t put that in any of your models any time soon here. There\u2019s quite a degree of additional dialog that needs to go on about not only the amount of the money, the interest, the taxation associated, the proper tax rates to apply to that. So I think you need to think of that as being still covered with a great deal of uncertainty. The Ecuadorian government has said that they\u2019re going to seek annulment of the award, but they haven\u2019t identified any basis upon which they can do that. In terms of the local court proceedings, there really hasn\u2019t been a significant change in timing or activity associated here. We did have the conflict of interest was identified basically with Mr. Cabrera. He\u2019s the individual who was appointed by the local court to make the remediation assessment, and it\u2019s been found out that he has an ownership position in a remediation company that stands to benefit financially from any judgment against Chevron. So he\u2019s got an obvious conflict of interest and he didn\u2019t make that known to the court. We\u2019ve asked the court to reject his work. The court\u2019s denied that request. And then we also have had one of the technical experts for the plaintiff has testified that reports were submitted to the local court under his signature but they were not his report. And he has said that he never concluded that the sites posed a risk to human health or the environment. So we\u2019ve had a number of positive developments but all that being said, I don\u2019t think it changes some of the fundamentals. There\u2019s still a great deal of uncertainty out there. While the court has finished with a lot of its procedural components, I think we still have to wait and see what the next steps are going to be.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch.\nDoug Leggate: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be able to answer this one terribly easy, but we monitor I guess you\u2019d call it your upstream capture rates which is looking at your kind of worldwide oil and gas prices weighted by your volumes on your net income, and for quite a while it was a fairly stable relationship. The last couple of quarters last year it fell a little bit and this quarter and last quarter, this quarter in particular, it has been pretty stellar. It\u2019s a terrific result, particularly in the international upstream. So my question is, is there something changing there? This is on an earnings basis obviously so I\u2019m thinking is there something changing in the DD&A level? Was there a tax benefit that was particular to this quarter? Obviously your tax rate was a little lower. If you could just give some color as to whether or not this is something that may actually be sustainable, because as I say it was up pretty [inaudible] capture rate this quarter.\nPatricia Yarrington: Well I don\u2019t have your numbers in front of me, Doug, but for DD&A we were comparative. For fourth quarter, DD&A was essentially flat. There really wasn\u2019t anything unusual going on in DD&A. Compared to first quarter 2009, DD&A was up 7% but our production over the time period was up 5%, so that was really what was driving that. So nothing terribly unusual.\nDoug Leggate: What about on the tax line?\nJeanette Ourada: Well, I was just going to follow up on the tax component. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you were going to ask here, but just on taxes we did see a lower effective tax rate in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and also compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. And that really, in both periods, reflects jurisdictional changes not only within the upstream, country by country analysis, but also between upstream and downstream. And then also, for example, in the international sector there was a change, a reduction in Canadian corporate tax rate that applied in the first quarter, for example, which was baked in there.\nDoug Leggate: Guidance is not something you normally give on tax, but should we expect that the tax rate is going to be kind of lower than your legacy run rate, given that change?\nJeanette Ourada: I think that it\u2019s too early to kind of give that sort of a forward indication. You know taxes are really very lumpy, and it really is dependent on earnings profiles across the jurisdictions.\nDoug Leggate: On the major projects that you brought on, a lot of these were liquids rich or liquids heavy, where are we in terms of the get off in terms of those projects now? Are they now at plateau? I guess Perdido is probably not, but in terms of the other major projects you brought on last year, are they now at fill rate? If you could give some color, that would be great.\nPatricia Yarrington: You know I think largely the answer to that broadly would be yes. I mean Perdido just came on at the very tail end of this quarter here, so that obviously has a ramp up profile that is much more extensive and will take quite some time. Tengiz\u2019 reliability has been very strong and Tengiz is currently producing around 600,000 barrels a day, which is just a tremendous accomplishment for the quarter. We mentioned Mafumeira Norte. It\u2019s hit peak production here at 42,000 barrels a day. And Frade. Frade continues to ramp up and we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve seen here, particularly most recently. Current production\u2019s about 60,000 barrels a day from five wells. So I think there will be some continued ramp, but in the broad answer I think we have seen the vast majority of the ramp up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research Equities.\nJason Gammel: Nice inflection point in terms of the earnings power of the downstream that became apparent during the quarter. My question is, our indicator margins for the west coast and Singapore, two areas that you have significant exposure to, would indicate that strength was actually building in April relative to what we saw late in the first quarter and certainly for the quarter as an average. Would you be able to confirm that the margin environment that you\u2019re facing in those two markets is improving and that you\u2019re able to capture those margins?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes, I think our best view really right now in both those locations would be that you may have some softening going into the second quarter because what was driving these really related to refinery maintenance and turnaround schedules. And depending upon how those units come back online, the extent to which they come back online, you know, again relative to demand, you may still have some sloppiness in the market.\nJason Gammel: The LNG market is obviously starting to swing towards the favor of the buyer versus the seller right now. Can you tell me if there\u2019s been any progress made on any incremental marketing of the Wheatstone volumes that are not committed right now?\nPatricia Yarrington: Right now we have about 60% of the Wheatstone volumes that are under HOAs or tentatively committed here. We continue to have tremendous interest on the part of prospective buyers. You know we\u2019ll update you as those HOAs come to fruition but we haven\u2019t seen really any softening in interest for our particular product supplies.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: Just going back to the deepwater Horizon disaster, I was wondering if you could just help me list the risks to Chevron from this instance. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll confirm that there\u2019s obviously no direct liability for Chevron, but some of the things that come to mind are the potential for a suspension of leasing I think is coming out of the White House this morning; there\u2019s obviously the potential for a suspension of activity in the deepwater GOM. I\u2019m thinking higher safety costs. I was wondering if you thought that would be an impact, perhaps even higher taxes. There is, I guess, the potential for oil movements to be disrupted. I don\u2019t know what your thoughts are on that and whether you\u2019re thinking about, for example, supply to Pascagoula or whether or not that might be a total red herring. And then of course there\u2019s the overall industry risk, but if you could just kind of throw out there what you perceive to be the risks. And again as I said I assume confirmed that there\u2019s no direct liability. That would help us begin to get our arms around this issue.\nPatricia Yarrington: Paul, you\u2019ve outlined a number of the risks that I\u2019m sure are in everybody\u2019s mind. I can\u2019t speak to any of those at this point in time. It\u2019s really just too premature. You know I would imagine, I mean there\u2019s tremendous interest as we all can appreciate, tremendous interest in trying to first stop the flow of oil, make sure that we\u2019ve got containment and clean up, and then understand what has happened. I think that we wouldn\u2019t want to pre-judge or leak too quickly. I\u2019m sure the administration and members of Congress won\u2019t want to be doing that either. So I really just don\u2019t know how this is going to play out. It\u2019s just too early to say.\nPaul Sankey: Have you guys ever had any kind of a similar instance yourselves?\nPatricia Yarrington: You know we have had an absolutely outstanding safety record and I can\u2019t think of one here, you know, recently that comes to my mind. You know we\u2019ve been operating globally for decades, and do not have any that comes to my mind at this point in time. We have an outstanding safety record. And this is not our incident, and we are not in any way touched by this from an operating standpoint. We have offered assistance to BP and to the MMS and to government entities, and we\u2019ve been taken up on that offer. So we stand ready, just as everybody in the industry stands ready to put collective intelligence and capabilities to work to get this handled.\nPaul Sankey: What would be the exact nature of the assistance you would give?\nPatricia Yarrington: Look, whether its equipment, people, processes, anything that they feel we can offer, we\u2019re happy to do it.\nPaul Sankey: But as such, it\u2019s an offer but you haven\u2019t actually done anything as such yet.\nPatricia Yarrington: No, there have been discussions between ourselves, government agencies, BP, etc. I mean it is a consortium of effort that is underway here, and that\u2019s really all I know and that\u2019s really all I can say about it.\nPaul Sankey: Can you just talk again about your volume target for the year? Obviously you\u2019re chasing ahead of that. Any thoughts about I guess there\u2019s an implied slowdown late in the year, but if you could just update on the latest after a strong Q1, and I\u2019ll leave it there.\nPatricia Yarrington: Sure. That\u2019s a good question. That\u2019s a fair question here. You know we had production for the quarter of 2.78 million barrels a day, you know it\u2019s 90,000 barrels a day ahead of our external guidance on a price adjusted basis. We talked about it being principally related to our base business performance, where we\u2019ve had good reliability and good optimization of facilities basically here. So our production efficiency has been running about 3% higher than our plan. Now on the go forward here, we do have a number of turnarounds that are planned in the second quarter and third quarter of the year. These would be TCO, for example, or in the North Sea, etc. We also can get into weather related issues, in the third quarter in particular, or second and third quarter in particular. So while it\u2019s a very good quarter for us and it bodes well going in, we are not in a position where we want to give an update at this point in time. We\u2019ll come back on in the second quarter call and be happy to do that for you.\nPaul Sankey: Is it fair to say that your Q1 volumes were ahead of what you\u2019d planned in terms of when you gave the original?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes. Absolutely. And that\u2019s because of the reliability factors that we\u2019ve gone through with you. We\u2019re just very pleased with how well all our facilities are running.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse.\nEdward Westlake: Just in terms of the CapEx outlook, you\u2019ve obviously got Grogon and Wheatstone coming in but you\u2019ve got projects like [Abame] and Tengiz which are very expensive coming out. Can you comment at this stage in terms of the type of CapEx run rate that you\u2019d expect, not just for this year but for outer years and is that one of the reasons perhaps why you\u2019re holding back in terms of buybacks?\nPatricia Yarrington: It\u2019s a good question. I mean, our C&E, we typically only give C&E targets out one year and we do that for a variety of reasons. It obviously depends on commodity prices and industry costs and we have seen and continue to see some variability in industry cost levels. So I\u2019m not going to talk to you about 2011 and 2012 or 2013 capital spending programs. And we do have large projects coming on, Grogon and Wheatstone are on the horizon certainly, but you need to keep in mind that we also are coming off of and have placed into service a number of high capital requirement projects, TCO, Agbami, etc. So you have somewhat of a dovetailing here between the placing in service of some historical projects that are giving us good cash flows and earnings now versus some future projects down the line. You know I don\u2019t think, and if you\u2019re thinking forward here a little bit, I don\u2019t think you should think about seeing any sort of dramatic increases in C&E, but at the same time we\u2019ve talked and I think George was pretty articulate about this at our meeting in March, you know, that to the extent that we see economic investment opportunities and I\u2019ll talk to incremental oil development opportunity for example in base business, or if we look forward a couple of years or whenever U.S. gas prices get to be sustained at a higher level, George talked about being able to bring on developments at the [Peonce] and Haynesville. So at the same time you shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see necessarily an uptick, because that will mean that we have found very good economic opportunities for incremental C&E spending.\nEdward Westlake: Is the feeling that you\u2019re too early in terms of comfort level about all of those five factors that you outlined in terms of doing the buybacks, is any of that related to some concern about the risk that Grogon and Wheatstone CapEx might end up being a little bit higher than you\u2019ve currently budgeted?\nPatricia Yarrington: No, not at all really. You know we\u2019re very early days into the Grogon and Wheatstone developments. You know on Grogon we\u2019ve awarded contracts for about $22 billion and because we\u2019re very reasonably early in the queue of spending compared to other LNG projects in that arena, we think we\u2019re in an advantaged place cost wise, price wise, contract wise.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng: Pat, you gave a number in your presentation that the base operations sequentially from fourth quarter is down about 27,000 barrels per day or 1%. Do you have that number for the first quarter versus?\nPatricia Yarrington: I don\u2019t have it with me Paul. You can give me a call and I\u2019ll give it to you later.\nPaul Cheng: I assume that that is probably much lower as you indicated, about 3% better than your current trend. Do we have any kind of timing [issue] in terms of a work over that just finished and so we thought that we have a big jump in the near term production. So trying to understand that. Is it just a normal better efficiency and better [operating] or we have some timing issue related to the benefit in the first quarter?\nJeanette Ourada: Well, it\u2019s primarily better reliability that Pat talked about. Our [Mellon Pie] operations were down for a turnaround during the first quarter, but that\u2019s really the only unusual activity.\nPaul Cheng: Second quick one is that headcount reduction, is all the people related to the [seven] charge in this quarter, are they all left the company already? And if they are not, when do you think the savings will start to flow through into your bottom line? And what is the target one way from those headcount reduction savings will be?\nPatricia Yarrington: Right. So the total accrual, $175 million, relates to a total of 3,800 employees spread across downstream and then the other corporate staff group areas. We expect, on the downstream side, that 2,000 will hit that target for downstream by the end of this year and I would say the vast majority of that 3,800 will occur by the end of 2010, early 2011. Certainly within the two year window you will have all of those reductions occur. In terms of a run rate, not all of these savings from headcount reductions are baked in, certainly not to our first quarter plans, probably not likely to see much of an impact in the second quarter. It would really only be as you moved into the third and fourth quarters that you would begin to see that impact. And the full effect really will be towards the end of 2011.\nPaul Cheng: And I know you guys talking about the $400 million non-[use] saving, of which how much of them is related to headcount reduction?\nPatricia Yarrington: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not understanding the question.\nPaul Cheng: The saving, that 3,800 people that when they all left, what is the actual saving to the P&L going to look like?\nPatricia Yarrington: I don\u2019t have a number for you on that because it\u2019s again spread across downstream and corporate staff and what not. It clearly is partly baked into the 7% ROCE improvement that Mike Wirth talked about in our security analysts meeting. Part of the efficiency improvements that he talked about obviously relate to the streamlining that we\u2019re working to do, and headcount is a piece of that.\nPaul Cheng: Final one I think is for Grogon and which I think there\u2019s a lot of concern with a lot of new [R&G] project coming on stream, even though you guys are a bit ahead of time, but if you were to reach the tail end by 2013, 2014, labor could be pretty tight. Pat, can you share with us that in terms of how you guys manage it or how the coin share is being said? You said a turn key and a fixed amount or that you\u2019re still subject to the spot rate for the labor market by [inaudible] during that development phase.\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes, I mean I think as far as I want to go on saying this, you know this project has been in seed and kind of well scoped out probably amongst the best of any significant major capital projects in the glow. And so we have had a lot of opportunity to work very hard on the contracting strategy and the contracting plan and as I said we\u2019ve executed, you know, $22 billion of awards against that. So I think we\u2019re getting, it\u2019s a very competitive project here and there\u2019s lots of pieces to it, lots of contracting to it, and I don\u2019t really want to generalize or get specifically into contracting strategy here with you. We\u2019re confident that it\u2019s going to be a very competitive project, once up and running, and so far you know we\u2019re on schedule and we\u2019re on plan.\nPaul Cheng: And can you tell us that on the labor side does that still make you subject to the spot market of the labor or not really? I mean you don\u2019t have to tell me exactly what\u2019s the temper [want to see], whether you\u2019re still exposed to the spot market of the labor market.\nPatricia Yarrington: Well, you know, as far as I want to go is just to say look, you know, it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest. Our interest, government\u2019s interest, labor\u2019s interest to get this project online, under the commitments that were agreed to at the time that we sanctioned the project. We have strong government support and everybody understands certainly locally there how important Grogon is to the local economy. So we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll be able to get the labor that we need at competitive prices and have an economic project.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company.\nMark Gilman: I believe either Jeanette or Pat mentioned a 600,000 barrel a day capacity at TCO. Is that just liquids and is it sustainable?\nJeanette Ourada: That\u2019s just oil Mark. You\u2019re correct.\nMark Gilman: And sustainability Jeanette?\nJeanette Ourada: It\u2019s looking very good right now.\nMark Gilman: Regarding the tax item that was mentioned in the international upstream, the Canadian statutory implications, is there a positive deferred tax one timer that was associated with that change in the statutory rate?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes.\nMark Gilman: Quantify it please.\nPatricia Yarrington: You know, I don\u2019t think we want to do that. But I\u2019d say here Mark, I know we were trying to get at taxes, I mean that was one piece. It was a small piece, but directionally it occurred in the quarter. I think it\u2019s very hard to give anymore information about taxes on a predictive sort of basis for you.\nMark Gilman: I\u2019m not asking for a prediction. I\u2019m just asking for the one time effect of the deferred tax adjustment that went along with that statutory change.\nPatricia Yarrington: Well, I don\u2019t have it handy. It\u2019s immaterial in the aggregate market.\nMark Gilman: Production versus the fourth quarter was up, yet there was no mention of volumetric effects in the international upstream, Jeanette, in your discussion. Should I assume that liftings were flat period to period and that\u2019s why there was no volume mention?\nJeanette Ourada: Well, we\u2019re under lifted in the first quarter, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. It\u2019s not that big.\nMark Gilman: What was the amount? I\u2019m sorry.\nJeanette Ourada: 1%.\nMark Gilman: And that\u2019s a shortfall of liftings versus first quarter production?\nJeanette Ourada: Correct.\nMark Gilman: Your deliveries and production in Bangladesh on the gas side have been constrained in the recent past by logistical, infrastructural and perhaps some contractual considerations. Looks like they jumped up pretty good in this period. Is this a signal that those issues have been resolved?\nPatricia Yarrington: There certainly has been increased demand in Bangladesh and we\u2019re continuing to de-bottleneck our existing facilities. We still do have pipeline constraints of getting the gas out, so we still have more resource if we can work through those.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: Two questions if I may. First, can you update us on anything you\u2019ve heard in Kazakhstan in terms of the contract review or tax review announced by the government and is there any effect on TCO?\nPatricia Yarrington: You\u2019re speaking to Karachaganak?\nPavel Molchanov: Tengiz.\nPatricia Yarrington: I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re referencing here really, but we have a strong relationship in Kazakhstan. We\u2019ve got tremendous long standing business there.\nPavel Molchanov: So in other words no tax review regarding Tengiz?\nPatricia Yarrington: No tax review regarding Tengiz. That\u2019s why I was asking you if you were talking about Karachaganak. TCO is kind of fundamentally our operation here and good, long standing relationship, good agreement on contracts, sanctity of contracts, well entrenched, everything\u2019s working quite well there. And in terms of the Karachaganak issues, really we need to refer you to the operator there. We\u2019re certainly just hopeful that the issues that are under dispute can come to conclusion quickly.\nPavel Molchanov: In other words no [re-through] for Tengiz of any kind?\nPatricia Yarrington: No re-through for Tengiz.\nPavel Molchanov: Your shale gas acreage in Poland, I think you have about a million acres, any timetable on when you might commence activity?\nJeanette Ourada: Yes, it\u2019s our plan here really to do seismic work in 2010 and probably look to begin drilling in 2011.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi.\nFaisel Khan: On the international upstream side, the $215 million of effects improvements sequentially quarter over quarter, is that number kind of sustainable through the entire year? Or does that actually get better or can we still see improvements going into second and third quarters?\nPatricia Yarrington: No. I mean I think we\u2019d like to get another quarter under our belt here. I mean, in the quarter the cost reductions or OpEx reductions that we saw were really kind of all over the place in terms of countries as well as cost categories. And I think that the way to look at this is, you know, fourth quarter typically is the higher Op expense quarter for us, first quarter is oftentimes the lower Op expense quarter for us, so I think you want to look at previous patterns in terms of your projections going forward.\nFaisel Khan: In terms of the production and volumes that looked like they were still ramping up in Kazakhstan and Eurasia, the numbers that you guys have seen over the last several quarters, is that continuing to ramp up or should we expect those numbers to be relatively flattish now?\nJeanette Ourada: No, I think flattish is probably a better place to target.\nFaisel Khan: And then the production declines in the Philippines, what caused the natural gas declines over there?\nPatricia Yarrington: It was a turnaround in the quarter. You should expect to see that come up next quarter.\nFaisel Khan: And last question on Grogon, as you guys have let all your contracts or allowed your contracts out for this project, how are you guys dealing with kind of I guess higher nickel prices and [inaudible] in a modular design, you tend to have higher material costs. So how are you guys dealing with that situation?\nPatricia Yarrington: Gosh, I don\u2019t have any unique information on that nickel cost impact on Grogon. You\u2019re right, it is modular design and we\u2019ve got work in a number of fabricating yards all across the globe really here. I don\u2019t have anything specific to offer on that particular item.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Jacques Rousseau \u2013 RBC.\nJacques Rousseau: I just wanted to ask another tax question, coming at it from a little different way. Would you be able to provide the international upstream tax rate in the first quarter and then compare it to some other quarters? And that may be able to help determine some of this difference.\nPatricia Yarrington: You know, I don\u2019t think we necessarily want to go into that kind of detail. I mean the effective rates, I mean they really can move quite substantially in the international sector from one quarter to the next quarter to the next quarter. And it\u2019s dependent literally upon the taxable income, by country, in those locations, any sort of tax changes that may have occurred, any sort of application of investment tax credits that are applicable. We also have differences associated with gains and losses on asset sales that can influence the effective tax rate. So I think that it\u2019s just hard for us to give a go forward point for you there.\nJacques Rousseau: Well, not so much for a go forward point but just to be able to compare historically as to what the change represented year-over-year.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay, well, year-over-year for a full year cycle, full year cycle, I think 2008 and 2009 have been relatively stable in the 43, 44% range. You know, fourth quarter was higher than that, first quarter was substantially lower than that for us. So you know it bounces around but for the year perhaps maybe thinking about it averaging out.\nJacques Rousseau: In terms of the chemical assets and earnings getting moved into the downstream, is there a kind of rule of thumb as to what percentage of the assets will be in the U.S. downstream and how much will go into the international downstream?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes. I mean, the chemical operations, right, are wholly owned Chevron Oronite and 50% joint venture with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. That 50% shows up in the U.S. segment and the Oronite has both U.S. and non-U.S. components to it.\nJacques Rousseau: Helpful. Thank you.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay. Thank you very much. I think that concludes our call for today. I want to thank all of you for your participation on the call. I especially want to thank the analysts who asked questions, good questions, on behalf of all the participants. So Sean I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes Chevron\u2019s first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}], "2012": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2011, "date": "2012-01-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning, my name is Sean, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.\nJohn S. Watson: Well, thanks, Sean. And welcome, everyone, to Chevron's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, you all know our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeanette Ourada, our General Manager of Investor Relations. And we'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, as usual, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Turning to Slide 3, I want to begin with safety where we always do. In March of last year, I talked with you at some length about Chevron's safety journey, over 100 years of focus and improvements in our systems and processes. I said we work to improve every day. As a result of our efforts, every key measure of safety and environmental performance has improved dramatically over the last decade. In fact, we just had another very good statistical year in safety. We had world-class low industrial injury rates, we had fewer fires, serious auto and other incidents; some very good performance during the year, but we\u2019re nowhere near where we want to be. In particular, we had drilling-related incidents in recent months in Brazil and Nigeria, sadly with 2 contract employee fatalities in Nigeria. We have full investigations underway and are doing everything we can to learn from these incidents. There is a great deal of information available on our website, and I'll be happy to answer any questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Our financial performance in 2011 was outstanding. We achieved record earnings and cash flow, underscoring the strength of our portfolio and strategic direction. Underlying these record financial results is our outstanding upstream earnings per barrel. We invest to generate value for our shareholders, and we like high-value barrels. While our peers have not all reported their fourth quarter results, we fully expect to maintain our wide lead on this critical metric. I'd like to summarize a few additional accomplishments in the upstream business. We sanctioned 3 major projects. We broke ground in December on Wheatstone, our second legacy LNG project in Australia. We also moved forward on Clair Ridge in the U.K. and Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf of Thailand, our Platong II project start up and ramped up very quickly. We completed our acquisition of Atlas Energy and supplemented it with some additional acreage acquisitions in the Marcellus. We continued our string of exploration successes offshore Australia with 4 natural gas discoveries, and we announced the Moccasin oil discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And we achieved 171% reserve replacement driven by the initial booking of about 740 million barrels of oil equivalent from our Wheatstone LNG Project. Looking at our downstream business, we made great progress in the second year of a 3-year plan to improve returns. The completion of the Pembroke Refinery sale marked a significant milestone in our portfolio rationalization process. We also made a final investment decision and began construction on a premium base oil plant at our Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery, which when completed will position Chevron as the world's leading supplier of premium base oils. We're very proud of our performance this past year. With that, I'll turn it over to Pat, who will take you through our financial results. Pat?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. Thanks, John. Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter earnings were $5.1 billion, or $2.58 per diluted share. For the year, earnings were a record $27 billion, or $13.44 per diluted share, over 40% higher than in 2010. Return on capital employed for the year was nearly 22%, and our debt ratio at year end was 7.7%. Of particular note, 2011 marked our 24th consecutive annual dividend increase. We had 2 dividend increases during the year, which resulted in a combined 12.5% rise in the quarterly rate in 2011. This is significant, indicating not only our superior performance and our financial strength, but also our confidence in our future performance. It is also consistent with our priority of rewarding shareholders with sustained and competitive dividend growth. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares, bringing the full year share repurchase total to $4.25 billion. In the first quarter of 2012, we expect to repurchase $1.25 billion of our shares. Finally, Chevron's 2011 total shareholder return was 20%. We hold the #1 TSR position versus our peer group for the 1-, 5- and 10-year periods. We are exceptionally proud of this achievement as it demonstrates our history of making wise portfolio investment decisions and executing well. Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $8.3 billion during the quarter. For the full year, cash from operations exceeded $40 billion, a record for the company and over 28% higher than last year. This reflects our impressive operating performance and the cash-generating strength of our portfolio. At year end, our cash balances totaled $20 billion, up $3 billion from the end of 2010. This put us in a net cash position of about $10 billion. Our strong cash flow and solid balance sheet continue to be competitive advantages. Turning to Slide 6. I'll compare results of the fourth quarter 2011 with the third quarter 2011. As a reminder, our earnings press release compares fourth quarter 2011 with the same quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter earnings were $5.1 billion, $2.7 billion lower than third quarter earnings. Upstream earnings were down $464 million, driven by an unfavorable swing in foreign exchange effects and higher operating expenses, partly offset by higher volume. Downstream results decreased $2 billion between quarters, resulting from weaker margins, the absence of asset sale gains, lower volumes and an unfavorable swing in foreign exchange effects. The variance in the Other bar reflects higher corporate charges. On Slide 7, our U.S. upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were $97 million higher than the third quarter's result. Higher realizations benefited earnings by $60 million. A 4% increase in crude oil realizations improved earnings by about $100 million, while a 13% drop in natural gas realizations reduced earnings by about $40 million. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $65 million between periods, primarily due to higher employee cost and increased maintenance activity. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including gains on several small asset sales. Turning to Slide 8. International upstream earnings were down $561 million relative to the third quarter. A net positive liftings variance across multiple countries increased earnings by $180 million. Higher operating expenses reduced earnings by $165 million, driven primarily by an increase in employee and maintenance expenses. Tax items across multiple jurisdictions decreased earnings by $100 million between quarters. This net number includes the absence of the one-time catch-up charge booked in the third quarter due to our retroactive tax increase in the U.K. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects lowered earnings by about $305 million. The U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies, most notably the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. The fourth quarter had a foreign exchange loss of around $3 million compared to a gain of about $300 million in the third quarter. These foreign exchange effects have minimal impact on cash. As we've said before, they are primarily balance sheet translation effects. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including lower realizations and higher exploration expense associated with seismic acquisition cost across the portfolio, as well as some well write-offs in China and Angola. Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Between quarters, production increased 42,000 barrels a day. Lower prices improved volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts during the fourth quarter, increasing production about 4,000 barrels a day. Base business combined with external constraints increased production a net 6,000 barrels a day.  Tengiz returned to normal operations following a turnaround activity in the third quarter, but the impact of this full restoration was partly offset by some unplanned downtime in December. Production in Thailand was also fully restored following a June third-party pipeline incident, only to be partly offset by lower demand as a result of flooding and seasonality in the fourth quarter.  Offsetting these net positive impacts were normal field declines and an extended turnaround in Trinidad. On the third quarter earnings call, we told you we expected fourth quarter production to increase approximately 100,000 to 150,000 barrels per day. Obviously, our forecast did not include the negative impacts of the events I just mentioned. Moving to the next bar, incremental production from major capital projects increased fourth quarter production by 32,000 barrels a day, primarily driven by the start-up of Platong II in Thailand and improved reliability at Perdido. Slide 10 compares full year 2011 net oil-equivalent production to that of 2010. Production decreased 90,000 barrels a day. Price impacts from production sharing and variable-royalty contracts decreased production by 32,000 barrels a day. The average Brent price increased about $32 in 2011.  For the full year, each dollar increase in Brent results in a 1,000 barrel per day volume reduction. Base business combined with external constraints lowered production by 103,000 barrels per day. Normal field decline and higher maintenance activity were partly offset by about 17,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent from our recently acquired Marcellus assets. Our decline rate for the year was about 4%, right in line with our prior guidance. Incremental production from our major capital projects contributed 45,000 barrels per day, reflecting the start-up of Platong II in Thailand and the ramp-up of AOSP in Canada, Frade in Brazil and Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico. Our original production guidance for 2011 was 2.79 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. We fell short of that guidance by about 115,000 barrels a day. About 1/3 of that is due to higher prices; about 1/3 is due to lower-than-expected major capital project performance, mostly Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico and Tombua-Landana in Angola; and the remaining 1/3 is lower base business performance, about half of which is due to the third-party pipeline rupture and decreased demand in Thailand. As John mentioned, our focus is on profitable barrel. For the year, our global upstream earned over $26 per barrel. This is an increase of over $8 per barrel from our 2010 results. We have led our peer group on this metric for over 2 years by a wide margin, and we expect the trend to continue as our competitors announce their fourth quarter results. Turning now to Slide 11. U.S. downstream earnings decreased $908 million in the fourth quarter. Margins dramatically weakened between quarters, lowering earnings by about $400 million. General industry fuel margins fell, contributing about half the decline shown in the bar. Seasonal declines in base oil and finished lubricant demand also punished fourth quarter margins. Maintenance at our Richmond, California and Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery also impacted margins and was the primary driver for lower produced volumes, which decreased earnings by about $200 million. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $155 million, resulting from increased employee cost and maintenance activity I just mentioned, along with associated higher transportation costs. Chemical earnings decreased by $80 million due to both lower margins and lower sales volumes. The Other bar consists of several unrelated items, including the absence of third quarter asset sales, negative LIFO affects and lower trading results. On Slide 12, international downstream earnings were $1.1 billion lower this quarter. Refining and marketing margins fell, reducing earnings by $155 million. This reflected weaker Asian demand coupled with regional recovery from shut downs. The next bar shows the $570 million negative earnings variance, primarily reflecting the absence of the third quarter gain on the sale of the Pembroke Refinery and related marketing facilities in the U.K. and Ireland. A swing in foreign currency effects reduced earnings by $230 million. The U.S. dollar weakened against both the Korean won and the Australian dollar during the quarter. Fourth quarter's foreign exchange loss was about $85 million compared to the third quarter gain of about $145 million. The Other bar here reflects a number of unrelated items, including lower chemical and trading results and higher operating expenses. Slide 13 covers All Other. Fourth quarter net charges were $553 million compared to a net $358 million charge in the third quarter. This is an increase of $195 million in charges between periods.  A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $30 million benefit to earnings. Corporate costs were $225 million higher this quarter. For the full year, this segment had net charges of $1.5 billion, putting us at the upper range of our $250 million to $350 million guidance range. We believe, going forward, a higher range of $300 million to $400 million is more appropriate. With that, I'd like to now turn it back over to John for a few thoughts on 2012.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay. Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 14. In early December, we announced our capital program for 2012 at $32.7 billion. The 2012 program is in line with our overall 2011 investments once the Atlas acquisition is included. We continue to develop an enviable project queue, with almost 90% of the program earmarked for upstream activity. We are progressing construction on our 2 world-class Australian LNG projects and deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments. We are planning for increased exploration activity around the world, along with additional work to further assess the Marcellus and Utica acreage we acquired this past year. The investments we're making today are on track to deliver significant production growth by mid-decade, which is expected to generate substantial cash flow over a long period of time. Our downstream investments for 2012 will focus on the construction of a premium base oil plant at our Pascagoula refinery and improving downstream returns through a number of energy efficiency and feedstock flexibility projects. Turning to Slide 15. This slide shows our net production outlook for 2012. Our full year outlook for 2012 is 2.68 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, essentially flat with 2011. The outlook assumes an average Brent price of $111 per barrel, the same average price as 2011 and does not assume OPEC curtailments, material security or market impacts. Major capital project start-ups, including Angola LNG and Usan, are expected to be largely offset by base business decline and major turnaround activity at Tengiz. 2012 will be the first major plant turnaround for the SGI/SGP facilities since start-up in 2008. We expect the turnaround to occur in the third quarter and last approximately 6 weeks. Base business decline is expected to be about 4%. Looking beyond 2012, I want to remind you of our long-term guidance. At the end of 2009, we said we expected to grow production, adjusted for price impacts, about 1% per year through 2014 and then grow 4% to 5% thereafter. We exceeded the 1% rate in 2010. We're a bit below 2011, but overall on track to meet our goals. With the strength and scale of our major capital projects and our strong base business performance, we continue to expect production to grow to 3.3 million barrels per day by 2017. We are advancing the queue, reaching critical milestones and are well positioned to deliver consistent growth and performance over the long term. Looking forward, let me highlight some of the activities we have planned for 2012 on Slide 17. In the downstream, we will mark the final year of our 3-year plan to improve returns. We're well on track to deliver on the commitments we made when we first began our restructuring program. Construction on the Pascagoula base oil plant continues, driving toward a 2013 start-up. We're on track for start-up of 2 major capital projects: Angola LNG and the Usan deepwater project in Nigeria. We expect increased exploration activity in both our core focus areas and some intriguing test areas around the globe. We expect to enter the front end engineering and design phase of the Future Growth Project at Tengiz, the Steamflood pilot expansion in the Partition Zone and our first expansion of Gorgon in Australia. In 2012, we will have a laser-sharp focus on execution as we continue construction on our Australia LNG and deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. I look forward to further discussing these plans in more detail at our Security Analyst Meeting on March 13 in New York City. We had a great 2011, and we're looking forward to delivering some strong results in 2012. Now that concludes my prepared remarks. We're now set to take some questions. So, Sean, if you'll please open the lines for those questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: It's been a tough few weeks for news flow clearly. Could you just underline for us the resolution that we now have on firstly, the situation in Brazil? The extent to which there's any more potential news flow from the spill or whether or not that's essentially got a line drawn underneath it. The same for Nigeria. And then finally, if you could address the recent legal news flow around Ecuador and where we are in that whole process, I would be grateful.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. Let me first talk about Brazil. As many of you know, we had a seep there from well drilling activity in November. And I would tell you that this is less a drilling issue as it is a subsurface issue. We were drilling a well in the Frade Field. Remember, we've had over 50 well penetrations in this field and know it pretty well. We hit pressure that was higher than we expected, took a kick, and our people responded in textbook fashion to control that kick, wading up the mud, et cetera. It took us some time to identify that seeps were as a result of that kick in the first couple of days. We\u2019d sent ROVs down the first day and didn't see anything around our wells. Remember, these are subsea wells, and there was nothing around the FPSO. We sent an ROV down again and saw these seeps. And so we commenced a significant action at that time to control the surface sheen that we were seeing and to control the seeps. And that has been largely a very successful effort. Now during that time, you saw some very strong reaction by regulators and in the media. I would tell you, we didn't necessarily put our best foot forward in some of the communication that we made at that time, but the event itself was handled in textbook fashion. Now since that time, we've been working very closely to improve the communications with regulators and to get them the necessary information that they need. But like the United States and some other countries, there are many different factions in Brazil. And there are a number of political issues around oil development from the environmental community, between the state and federal level. And so you have a lot of different views on oil development, and there are many forces at work in Brazil. We're doing our best to deal with the circumstance. I can't predict what may come. What I do know is the facts would suggest that our people responded very well to this event. And all we ask is to be treated fairly consistent with the facts and to be treated as Petrobras or others would be treated in a similar circumstance. In terms of Nigeria, the Nigeria event is a serious event and very concerned about it. Obviously we had 2 fatalities from that incident. I'm pleased that the evacuation that was put in place was fairly orderly and that 152 individuals were able to escape. As you might imagine, our first priority was dealing with those 152 individuals and searching for the 2 that proved to be lost. We've been conducting interviews with those individuals to try to better understand what happened. We have said that we had thought that there was some type of an equipment failure on surface facilities. What we know is that there were gas returns from the formation through the annuals that were being circulated out through the mud/gas separator. This is not at all unusual. This is a fairly routine type of activity, but then something went wrong. And we don't know a lot more about it than that. We're doing a root cause analysis. We're trying to piece through the information that we're getting to better understand it. But our real focus right now is really on putting out the fire that continues to this day. As you probably read in the material we've put out, we've mobilized 2 rigs to drill relief wells. One is more precaution. We presume the first will be successful. But in the event that it encounters any challenges, we've got a second. We've received considerable help from the industry in making those rigs available, which we're pleased with. And we're doing well planning right now. I would expect we would spud one of those relief wells within the next week or so. We have seen the size of the flame go down significantly since the initial event, but we're monitoring that as we go. I'll remind you, this is a gas well that's burning. You do see a plume around the site. That's silt and mud as it's been \u2013 it\u2019s a very shallow site. It's 40 feet of water. And so as the gas comes up, a lot of silt and mud is being disturbed and so you see that plume. We've been sampling that, that's mud, and that will eventually dissipate and settle to the bottom. So more work underway. Certainly, I'm concerned about these events. They're fairly different events as I indicated. The one in Brazil I would categorize more as a geologic event than drilling related. The one in Nigeria is clearly related to drilling activities and surface activities. We'll continue to do what we always do in these circumstances. We'll work very hard to understand. We've got a root cause analysis team that's been flown in from around the world to understand it. We've taken actions, as you might expect, with stand downs in our drilling organization reinforcing well control standards, and that's on top of many of the proprietary things that we do. But certainly, I'm very disappointed in those particular events. Now when it comes to Ecuador, that has been in the news as well. I won't go through the case in great detail because I think most of you know the history. If you're on the phone and you don't, I encourage you look at our website because we have quite a bit of information. And I think it's generally acknowledged that this case is a product of fraud. Most of us know that. This is a collaboration between corrupt plaintiff lawyers in the U.S. and a corrupt judiciary in Ecuador. Nonetheless, we're moving it through the judicial system. There have been events in really 3 courts recently: one in Ecuador, one in New York and one in The Hague. So I'll quickly tell you what's happened in each one. On January 3, a panel of 3 temporary judges overseeing our appeal of the Lago Agrio verdict in Ecuador upheld that original ruling. So on January 20, Chevron filed an appeal seeking a review by Ecuador's National Court of Justice. Basically, we're pursuing all available procedural steps in Ecuador as you would expect. Remember, we have no assets in Ecuador. So the second area where there's been court activity has been in The Hague. On January 25, the BIT Tribunal, that is the Bilateral Investment Treaty Tribunal in The Hague, converted its previous interim measures order to an interim award, and that makes it have more standing in the international community. And basically, the award is targeted at the Republic of Ecuador and says that Ecuador is obligated to prevent enforcement worldwide, pending a full review and formal trial in the merits of the case. This award is helpful to us in preventing enforcement outside of Ecuador. I would also point out that in previous rulings that the tribunal has made, they have already indicated that Ecuador will be financially responsible for all the damage caused by this fraud if Chevron prevails. So we've had some strong wording out of that court and are encouraged by that, and there's another hearing scheduled. And then finally, on January 26, in New York, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued an opinion reversing and vacating the Southern District Court's injunction. We had sought to stop enforcement in U.S. courts, stop the plaintiffs from enforcing any judgment that might be achieved in Ecuador in courts outside the United States. And in a fairly narrow procedural ruling, the courts held that, that statute cannot be implied for purposes of such enforcement. But it was a fairly narrow procedural ruling, and it doesn't change -- in fact, it made no comments about the merits of the case. And in fact, it made no comment about the RICO case. And so you can expect that, that will continue on its way. I know this can be confusing. We said at the outset with this case when you have a collusion and a fraud outside of the United States, you have to work many avenues to protect yourself. We still have many defenses, both in Ecuador, in The Hague and elsewhere where we've put together defense team should enforcement be sought elsewhere. It's certainly unfortunate that we're at this point. But when you have an elaborate fraud that's being perpetrated against you, that's what you have to do. So I hope that wasn't too long an update on those 3 matters.\nPaul Sankey: John, I mean my follow-up would simply be the -- what are the next dates or events that we should look for as the next sort of meaningful news flow items on those 3 issues as we go into 2012? And I'll leave it there.\nJohn S. Watson: Yes. At some point, we'll hear a final determination in the court of -- in Ecuador. I'll leave that to you to decide what you think will happen there. There could be more out of the BIT Tribunal, and then there could be more actions that we could take in New York under the RICO case. So that's where we are.\nPaul Sankey: And dates for more news flow from Nigeria and Brazil?\nJohn S. Watson: Those are hard to predict. I think as -- we'll notify you, for example, when we spud the relief well. To some degree, events will dictate what we -- where we put out news. But any significant change in the status of the well or the status of the work we're doing, we'll certainly keep you apprised. And for those that haven't seen it, we're putting up pretty regular updates on our website on both Brazil and Nigeria.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.\nEdward Westlake: You mentioned, Pat, the $10 billion on the balance sheet continues to provide Chevron with competitive advantages, I guess only if you're going to do something with the cash, obviously long range growth targets unchanged. So just some color perhaps on, is it because portfolio options for additional spend are not yet matured? Is it because you're worried about inflation in terms of the existing projects you have? Or are you thinking perhaps U.S. gas prices being so weak will present a strategic opportunity for you guys?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, let me make a few comments because we have some priorities for our cash. Clearly, we have a strong balance sheet, one of the strongest in the industry. We're heading into a period where we have significant capital expenditures ahead of us. And I've said previously that we want to be sure that we can execute this group of major capital projects uninterrupted. And you can have considerable volatility in the commodity markets. So even though we may think oil prices will be more than adequate to preserve our cash status so that we can fund these capital projects, we have a more conservative balance sheet than might otherwise be the case to ensure that we can execute these major capital projects. That's I guess number one that I would tell you. We want to be able to fund these projects. We of course want to be able to continue to pay the dividend and increase the dividend as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit going forward. And then we have further flexibility to repurchase shares if cash gets above the rate that we think affords us those protections. And we have -- and as you've seen, we have done that. We're not saving it for a particular purpose. We are opportunistic when it comes to opportunities to add to the portfolio, and we want to be in a position of having sufficient resources to be able to take advantage of an opportunity. You've seen last year, we made small acquisitions in the Marcellus and add-on bolt-on acquisitions, and the balance sheet that we have affords us that sort of flexibility. We don't have to do any acquisitions, but we're in a position to take advantage of opportunities with the balance sheet that we have. So that's kind of the priorities that we have for the cash debt balance that we have today.\nEdward Westlake: And maybe a follow-on then. So Gorgon, Wheatstone and Jack/St. Malo, some of the Big Foots, some of the big projects. Gorgon, I think, maybe towards the end of this year, you'll be in a more comfortable position in terms of really understanding productivity. And the ultimate cost of that project probably provides a read through to Wheatstone. So at that point, would you be more comfortable to say okay, we've got through the hump of the CapEx and we could maybe return cash to shareholders or do something different?\nJohn S. Watson: I think you hit it about right in terms of the sort of understanding what -- cost, if you will. If you look at Wheatstone -- I just had an update last night with the project team, for example, on both Gorgon and Wheatstone. I meet with them -- once a month, I meet with the project manager and line management and had a pretty thorough update on where we are at Gorgon. And we're 36% complete now. It's going very well other than a cyclone that's descending on Barrow Island as we speak. That's one of the things that we deal with. We have hardened facilities there, so we'll manage our way through that. But the project is going very well, 36% complete. And I'll just tell you, we're on track for kind of late 2014 start-up of Gorgon. I feel pretty good about the progress that we have made on that flagship project. From a cost point of view, and maybe just what you were getting at, we will have -- this will be the first year where we'll have a lot of on-island activity. And so we'll get a good chance to understand labor productivity and the progress that we're making. That, coupled with impacts of foreign exchange, for example, will dictate whether there's any change to cost one way or another. At this point, the $37 billion is the target for the project. And if we have anything more to say, it's probably more later in the year. So on the subject of will we change our balance sheet structure as the year wears on, I think it's fair to say that as we get closer to start-up of these big projects, remember, we've got Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot, Tubular Bells, that all start up in that -- Wheatstone is a little later, but the big ones in the 2014 time frame as we get closer to that date, the need for flexibility on the balance sheet diminishes. And then we'll have choices for what we do with that additional cash.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.\nArjun N. Murti: John, you outlined a number of the big projects, Australia LNG, deepwater, you got some big international projects. The big glaring hole is U.S. shale and U.S. liquids shale in particular. You do have the Marcellus, but as some of these opportunities start to expand and mature, they do actually look quite substantial. I'm curious how you -- if you can provide some comments on how you do thinking about addressing that seeming hole in your portfolio. There are a lot of jobs that come with these projects. There's a lot of opportunity to invest here in America. You are the second-largest energy company in the U.S. Between the inherent investment opportunity and some of the other benefits of investing here, how do you see that as a strategic need for Chevron?\nJohn S. Watson: Yes, sure, Arjun. Look, we're very positive on shales. As you know very well, the shale gas business in this country was really built by the independents because you had to have strong land departments. And so major companies got involved by buying their way in. And so prices began to run up. And we felt we always were very focused on value even -- no matter how much we might like rocks, we're always very focused on value. And many have plunged in with big dollars, and perhaps those will prove to be money well spent. For our view, we had some pretty strict criteria, and we have made some targeted acquisitions at areas where we know we have a low-cost basis of doing business, including a substantial carry to cushion us through a difficult period in the gas market. I guess I'd point out that we have some 8 million acres of shale around the world. And in March, you'll hear George give you an update on not just the Marcellus and Utica shales, but also some of the things we're working in West Texas and otherwise. So we feel pretty good about our portfolio. We have opportunities overseas. We're just drilling a well in Poland. We're drilling a well, in fact, our second well in the Duvernay in Canada. So I think we have a little more than might be commonly recognized, but we're not ideologically against these things. And we have some acreage that we've had for a long time that\u2019s held by production in the Delaware basin, et cetera, that did show some promise as well. So I think we'll have an opportunity in March, Arjun, to give you a more thorough update of what we have. But we're not ideologically opposed to shales. We just want to enter in a way where we can generate some value.\nArjun N. Murti: John, I realize there's sort of no absolute answer here in the sense that it's always case-by-case specific. But we\u2019ve generally presumed some of the joint ventures that some of the international and non-U.S. companies have done are probably inherently less likely for Chevron to pursue. Is that true? And then the related follow-up is do you feel a need to add expertise via adding employees of other companies, potentially in terms of pursuing U.S. opportunities?\nJohn S. Watson: I think it's fair to say that if we were going to take on a significant new opportunity in the U.S., organizational capability would be a consideration. When we acquired Atlas, we picked up some very good people with that, and that was very, very helpful to us. Certainly, manpower is at a premium. So I think that is the important part of what we're looking for. So what was the other part of your question?\nArjun N. Murti: Just on joint ventures. Again, that's been an avenue for some folks. We've thought it as less likely for you all.\nJohn S. Watson: Well, there are 2 aspects to the joint venture. One is if you come in and are carrying the partner or the operator, you're paying a disproportionate level of cost. And with the gas market where it is, that's going to be difficult financially for a period of time. We acquired Atlas, and that came with a carry. So we like that better. Second, coming in as a non-operator isn't our preferred approach. If we were going to apply our expertise, we'd rather have some degree of control. We looked at a lot of these different ventures, and you had to come in with money, and you had to come in and really have the pace and activity and practices dictated by non-operators. And in many cases, those were operators we didn't want to be in that position with.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: John, I know you guys have an increase in exploration activity this year. I was wondering if you could provide an update on exploration, in particular Liberia, Bear's Hump basin in the Gulf of Mexico. I think you have 4 to 5 rigs working today and/or some of the shale positions that you mentioned, please?\nJohn S. Watson: Yes, we do have quite a bit of exploration activity this year. As you know, we've been accumulating acreage over the last several years. So where are we drilling wells this year? We have a key well that will be spudded shortly in Liberia. We've talked about that. We've got a well drilling now in China. That's a very encouraging well. We've got a well drilling now in Poland. We've got well drilling now in the Duvernay up in Canada. So we have those -- certainly those that are underway. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have 4 rigs currently. I should note, we have had one dry hole in China. So we're on our second well there. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have 4 rigs currently. Right now, they're all working salt activity, but we do have exploration wells ahead. We were unable to get the Coronado well down, so we're looking for a new location and a new opportunity to drill that well. And so those are some of the highlights that I would offer in the portfolio this year. We will have some tests in the Utica that we'll drill this year. And so that's encouraging, and more in the Duvernay.\nEvan Calio: So it sounds like there'd be some key exploration results maybe in the 1Q here?\nJohn S. Watson: Yes. I don't know...\nPatricia E. Yarrington: As the year progresses.\nJohn S. Watson: As the year progresses, I think the Liberia well will be an interesting one for us.\nEvan Calio: For sure. The second question I have, can you tell me the reserve bookings related to Wheatstone? And then with your recent discovery, in addition to the 5 others, that could support I think 11 straight right now? They could support a third train in Wheatstone. I mean, how should we -- how will that process develop in 2012, as well as any potential Gorgon expansion where I believe you have space for 5 trains? I'm just thinking you could see within the existing portfolio even an extended growth beyond calendar 2017.\nJohn S. Watson: Oh, to be sure. First, the Wheatstone booking was 740 million barrels. And so obviously that was a significant contributor to our reserve adds for the year. In terms of what's likely to come next, we have 3 trains at Gorgon, 2 in the foundation project at Wheatstone. The most likely next step is a fourth train at Gorgon. And whether we can get to a fifth train on Barrow Island will remain to be seen. We believe we have the plot space. But subsequent trains at Wheatstone will likely then follow the fourth train at Gorgon. And that will be a proportion of the resources that we have accumulated and any third-party activity. Remember, that's a hub site. And so it'll also be a function of resources that we can bring to that site, which bring down fixed costs. And we're actively working that aspect as well.\nEvan Calio: So are those pre-FEED? Is that an accurate assessment?\nJohn S. Watson: Yes. Those are earlier stages. The one that's most likely for FEED is Train 4 at Gorgon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.\nJason Gammel: First of all, on reserve replacement, John, obviously a big number at Wheatstone. But even directing that out, it looks like just under 100% replacement from all other sources. Are you able to provide any further breakdown of the geographic reserve adds? And I think specifically, I would be looking at deepwater Gulf of Mexico because I believe last year, there were some price implications that prevented you from booking some of the reserves associated that you -- with the projects that are moving forward there.\nJohn S. Watson: Yes. We did make a booking on Jack/St. Malo this year. And so -- in fact, if you look at the typical categories of extensions, et cetera, all the categories of reserve movement were positive, other than the impact of price and obviously, production during the year. So Big Foot, we also made a booking this year. You'll see more as we -- in the annual report when we disclose it. But it was fairly broad-based. We did have bookings in the Marcellus as a result of our activity there as well. So it was fairly broad-based and positive. I'll just remind you, these things are lumpy. A year ago, when our bookings were a little bit low, we said these things are lumpy. And it's a function of largely major capital project timing. But we're also doing a lot of very good work in reservoir management to be sure that we're getting the necessary technical work done to book reserves as fast as we can when we know developments are coming, and they're really waiting on technical work or determinations to meet booking standards. So our reservoir management group continues to do good work around the company.\nJason Gammel: That's great. And if I could -- with a second question. Upstream margins, obviously comparing you against many of your peers, they've been fantastic. But if I look at the fourth quarter and compare it to your own good history, I'm actually looking at capturing about 21% of the Brent price, whereas you've been capturing pretty consistently between 23% and 24% of the Brent price, really just referring specifically to the international margin. Is there anything going on in the quarter that makes it non-representational? Or should we be looking at the potential for cost inflation to start eroding that great margin that you had established over the course of 2011?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, Jason, I think I'll take this one, if you don't mind. So realizations generally were relatively flat globally there. We had higher exploration expense. I mentioned the seismic activity and the well write-off that we had. So fourth quarter was a little bit higher on exploration expense. We also had higher operating expenses, I mentioned that. And then there was additional charges, one-time charges, tax-related charges in the fourth quarter that you would not see recur again. And that was -- it was a significant charge there.\nJohn S. Watson: I think the general message I would give you is there hasn't been something fundamentally changed in our portfolio. We have a strong portfolio. We will continue to perform well, particularly with high oil prices. And in March, you'll see us talk a little bit more about our portfolio and some of the new projects coming in, because the new projects are very good also. And they are high return per barrel. So naturally, we've got a range of profitability across the portfolio. But on balance, we think this lead we have is something we're very likely to keep in the kind of oil price environment, in particular with the sort of North America gas prices that we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Y. Cheng: John and Pat and Jeanette, several part question if I could. Pat, can you give us a rough idea that -- how's the CapEx trend is going to look like from 2013 until 2017? I presume that there's a number of projects you still need to sanction and that you're probably not going to see any relief? So should we assume that it's going to be up, say, couple billion dollars on average a year comparing to this year level?\nJohn S. Watson: Yes. Paul, if I can comment. The major spend projects, we sanctioned and are underway. And we're heading into a period of heavy construction. Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot, all of those projects are kind of in their high-spend period in the period 2012 to '14. So that's when you should be looking to see kind of -- those are likely to be high-spend years. And we've given you a number for 2012. We haven't given numbers beyond that, but I would just say that period is likely to be the 3-year period. The next big project that will add a big tranche of cost is likely to be Future Growth Project at Tengiz. And we're likely to begin progressing that. But that's slated for start-up 2017, later, later kind of time period. And so that peak spend will likely be later in the time period. And same thing goes for the Steamflood Project in the Partition Zone, which would be a significant spend. That's behind these big projects. So I wouldn't look for a major tranche of increase from beyond what we've talked about during this period.\nPaul Y. Cheng: And, John, we're looking at all the noise surrounding your oil spill in Brazil and also the last couple years that some of \u2013 a little bit change in the political wind, how they treat the foreign oil company in the country, all those add together, does that change your view about the commitment of the -- or I shouldn't use the word commitment, but the appetite of the company in that country?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, let me make a broader comment. I think that host governments, whether it's the United States, China or Brazil, have very high expectations for companies like ours. They expect the best. We trade on our reputation. Us and frankly other IOCs trade on our reputation. And so we get held to a very high standard. They expect excellence from us. And when they don't see it, they come down hard. And we've seen that take place elsewhere. So that's part of what the expectation is, and we need to not put oil in the water. And that's what we work to do every day. So expectations are high. Transparency is high, and anyone who has an agenda that might not be consistent with our objectives is going to point out any flaws or mistakes that we make. So we should expect that, and we have to deal with it. We do work very hard to get balance and facts out into these circumstances and assume that rule of law and consistent treatment will prevail. But certainly, expectations are higher today than they might have been 2 or 3 years ago.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Okay. And just on the resource base. I understand it's lumpy in terms of moving into the proven reserve. Do you have a rough estimate you can give us between 2012 to 2015? How much is your existing probable resource that you can prove into the proven reserve from the major projects?\nJohn S. Watson: I don't have it. I mean, I would tell you, over time, we're obviously targeting to replace more than 100% of reserves. But I don't have a particular target for you. George will give you a little more -- a little bigger breakdown on -- you'll recall, last year, he talked about some of our big projects and how much had been booked on those projects. We'll give you some of that same information in March to try to help you with that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.\nMark Gilman: On Angola LNG, could you discuss what marketing arrangements you have underway or in place for the gas? And then I have a follow-up.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. Mark, as you know, the project was originally designed to bring gas to the United States. We've been working with Sonangol and our other partners to put in place a diversion program, which of course makes sense given markets in Europe and Asia. And I expect that over time, we'll have the flexibility to move gas to those markets. So that's basically the plan for us.\nMark Gilman: John, if I could just follow-up on that, are there any short-term contracts you have in place to move that gas to Asia?\nJohn S. Watson: We\u2019re in the process of contracting kind of as we speak. And so I don't have, for example, a destination for the first cargo to share with you.\nMark Gilman: Okay. My follow-up relates to the 2012 production forecast. I'm wondering, are there any production sharing contract thresholds that have entered into that number? And if you could be a little bit more specific in terms of what the volumetric impact might be of the Tombua-Landana disappointment, as well as the major Tengiz turn, is that a full plant turn for 6 weeks so it\u2019ll be completely shut down? Or is it something less than that?\nJohn S. Watson: It is a full plant turnaround. So it's a very significant event. In terms of other PSC effects, the PSC effects can vary by price. So there are different impacts in the $70 range, in the $90 range, in the $110 range. So they do vary. But I'm not going to get into the specifics of those. Jeanette may have a comment here.\nJeanette Ourada: Mark, I think you\u2019re asking were we going to hit any PSC triggers in 2012, and there's no major trigger in our forecast that we're expecting.\nMark Gilman: Okay. And the Tombua-Landana issue?\nJohn S. Watson: Performance hasn't been up to what we had expected, and we're dealing with it to see if we can resolve some of the issues. But the production's a little shy of -- what we said is production was a little bit shy of what we had built in the plan this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Iain Reid with Jefferies.\nIain Reid: Could I ask a couple of questions again on LNG? You took FID on Wheatstone with I think a kind of industry low in terms of the amount of gas which had been marketed. Are you keeping some of this back for your own marketing operation? Or do you intend to contract that completely, say, during this year? And secondly, on Browse, this one seems to be slipping quite a long way down the program in Australia. Is this a project now you've kind of put in the post-2020 start-up frame, given the difficulty there?\nJohn S. Watson: Yes. A couple comments. First, we've been pretty successful in our gas marketing. We're about 70% under SPA at Gorgon, about 60% in Wheatstone. And we continue to have good conversations with gas customers. Recall some have been impacted by -- some of the contracting has been impacted by the events around Fukushima. So it's been a very sensitive and difficult time for some of the Japanese customers. So I expect that as we move along, we'll get into 85%, 90% range. And every indication I have based on my conversations with our gas people is that, particularly with some events taking place around the world, there's plenty of demand out there at similar pricing to what we're seeing today. But we're 60% at Wheatstone, and I expect we'll move forward successfully.\nJeanette Ourada: Browse.\nJohn S. Watson: Oh, and Browse. Browse, I'm probably best referring you to Woodside who's the operator there. I think the intent of partnership is to keep the retention licenses in place. Remember, there are some conditions that were put on development. There were some actions that were required of the partnership in order to retain the retention licenses. And the partners have been working through the economics of the scheme that was put forward by the operator. And so I don't want to prejudge or comment on that. I'll just say that we're committed. We're certainly committed to developing the resource, and it has to be done in an economic way. But I probably need to leave that to Woodside as they're the operator.\nIain Reid: Could I ask just one very quick follow-up on something you answered earlier in terms of the impact of the Tengiz Future Growth Project on future CapEx. Are you basically saying to us that $30 billion, $33 billion is kind of where Chevron's going to be for the next 6, 7 years in terms of overall spend?\nJohn S. Watson: No. I didn't say that. What I said was '12, '13 and '14 are peak years because of the LNG projects. And if you simply did math and took out those expenditures, you would see a big drop off. But we continually add items into the hopper, and the Future Growth Project is one of those. But it doesn't mean spending will necessarily be at this $33 billion level.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi.\nFaisel Khan: I believe in  -- last year, when you guys put out your original budget for 2011, you talked about a $26 billion budget and you came in at $29 billion for 2011. So if you can talk about what caused that budget for -- what caused the number for '11 to be higher than your original budget? And you can also talk about for 2012 what the major variables are that can influence the budget for 2012 as we get to the end of the year.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. I'll let Pat take that one.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, yes. So principally, there were 2 items that I'd call your attention to. One we did a little bit of coring up around the Atlas acquisition property, so a little bit of coring up around the Marcellus. That was not planned at the time we put out the original target there. And I would also say, because of the strong price environment, particularly in the U.S., we've had additional activity in the U.S. And that led to -- those 2 items really account for that increase of about $3 billion. In terms of any other outlook changes that we've got relative to the planned C&E target for 2012, there's nothing that comes to mind that we need to update you about. We feel good about the $32.7 billion figure that we've put out.\nFaisel Khan: Okay. Then on your guidance for corporate expense, you said that was going to be a little bit higher this year versus kind of last year. Is it the major incidences kind of between Nigeria and Brazil that are influencing that corporate expense number?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: No. Actually, if you look back, we have had the corporate guidance in that sector be $250 million to $350 million for quite some time, several years in fact. And all I was really trying to do was acknowledge the fact that we do have corporate departments whose salaries go up a little bit over time. In this particular case, we had some additional pension expense that's related to the funding position of our pension, and I expect a little bit of that to be higher in 2012. So it's really just trying to give you a little bit of better guidance.\nFaisel Khan: Okay. And lastly, on the Coronado, you said the well was not able to get down, or you did not drill the well in Coronado?\nJohn S. Watson: We drilled the well. We weren't able to get down. It couldn't get through the salt. Okay, with that, thank you, Sean. In closing, let me say we certainly appreciate everyone's participation in today's call. I especially want to thank each of the analysts on behalf of all the participants for their very good questions during this morning's sessions. Goodbye. Thank you, and we'll see you in March.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2011, "date": "2011-10-28 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of -- the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter Earning's Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Mike Wirth, Executive Vice President of Downstream and Chemicals; and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager, Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2011. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $7.8 billion or $3.92 per diluted share. Earnings in the third quarter 2011 were more than twice that of third quarter 2010. Upstream benefited from higher crude oil prices, and Downstream benefited from gains on asset sales and improved margins. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months exceeded 22%. Our debt ratio at the end of September was 7.5%. This is lower than previous quarters due to the early and economic redemption of a $1.5 billion Chevron Corporation bond. In the third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the fourth quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount. Of particular note, we announced Wednesday that Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.03 per share or 3.8% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend. Our Board took the unusual step to authorize a second dividend increase this year because of the company's strong performance and financial position, as well as their confidence in the company's future cash-generating capabilities. Chevron has a long history of annual dividend increases, 24 consecutive years. The 2 dividend actions in 2011 resulted in annual quarterly dividend increase of 12.5%, which is consistent with our priority of delivering long-term dividend growth to our shareholders. Turning to Slide 4. Cash generation from operations was $11.5 billion during the third quarter. This is, yet again, a new quarterly record for the company and has resulted from continued strong operational performance. Asset sales during the quarter, which included the Pembroke Refinery, generated about $2 billion in proceeds. Year-to-date, cash generated from operations was $32 billion, reflecting the strong cash-generating power of our recent investments and of our base business. This strong cash flow allows us to both reinvest in the top-tier project queue, as well as reward our shareholders with meaningful dividend growth and a sustainable share repurchase program. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled over $20 billion, up $3.3 billion year-to-date. This puts us in a net cash position of $10.6 billion. Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.\nJeanette Ourada: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 5. I'll compare results of the third quarter 2011 with the second quarter 2011. As a reminder, our earnings release compares third quarter 2011 with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter earnings were $7.8 billion, slightly higher than second quarter earnings. Starting on the left side of the chart, Upstream earnings were down $670 million, driven by lower crude oil realizations and lower volumes, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. Downstream results increased $942 million between quarters, benefiting from gains on asset sales, favorable foreign exchange effects and improved international margins. The variance in the Other bar reflects the unfavorable swing in corporate tax items. On Slide 6, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the third quarter were $442 million lower than the second quarter's results. Combined crude oil and natural gas realizations reduced earnings by $190 million. Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realizations decreased 7% between consecutive quarters, slightly higher than the 5% drop and posted Midway Sunset and LLS spot prices. Natural gas realizations also dropped, decreasing 5% between quarters, in line with average Henry Hub spot prices. Between quarters, sales volumes decreased 32,000 barrels oil equivalent per day, decreasing earnings by $105 million. The Other bar is comprised of a number of unrelated items, including the absence of gains on several small asset sales during the second quarter. Turning to Slide 7. International Upstream earnings were down $228 million compared with the second quarter. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $225 million. Unit realizations for liquids decreased about 4%, in line with the decrease in average Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations were relatively flat between periods, but benefited earnings by about $45 million due to sales mix. Lower liftings across multiple countries decreased earnings by $250 million. Between consecutive quarters, liquids liftings were down 54,000 barrels per day, and natural gas sales volumes were down 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Comparing third quarter liquids production with third quarter liquids liftings, we were underlifted by about 1%. Moving to the next bar, as you know, the U.K. raised the effective tax rate from 50% to 62% in July, retroactive to March. The total impact recognized in the third quarter was $180 million, about $135 million related to the first 6 months and about $45 million related to the current quarter. Moving to the next bar, a favorable change in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $275 million. The U.S. dollar strengthened against many currencies, most notably the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. The third quarter had a foreign exchange gain of about $305 million compared to a small gain of about $30 million in the second quarter. These foreign exchange effects have minimal impacts on cash. They are primarily balance sheet translation effects. The Other bar reflects a number of items, including lower exploration expense and lower OpEx. In total, our global Upstream earned almost $27 per barrel for the quarter. Based on preliminary competitor results announced to date, we outpaced our nearest competitor by over $5.5. We've now led our peer group on this metric for over 2 years. Slide 8 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Between quarters, production decreased 95,000 barrels per day. We don't show a price effects bar this quarter, as the production impact from the $4 decrease in average Brent spot prices is negligible due to the timing of cargoes. Moving to the first bar, impacts relating to a third-party pipeline incident in Thailand negatively affected production by 27,000 barrels per day. Repairs have been completed on the 2 pipelines. The larger pipeline was back online in August and the smaller pipeline in mid-September. Gulf of Mexico tropical storms, Don and Lee, decreased production by 10,000 barrels per day. Production has since been restored at all impacted facilities, and operations have returned to normal. Base business production decreased 64,000 barrels per day. Of this, about 30,000 barrels per day was related to a high level of planned and unplanned maintenance in the quarter, most notably in the U.K., Australia and Kazakhstan. Because the third quarter was a heavy turnaround quarter, as it usually is, I want to highlight that our year-to-date decline rate is in the 3% to 4% range, consistent with our previous guidance. Incremental production for major capital projects benefited third quarter production by 6,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by the continued ramp up of Frade in Brazil and Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to Slide 9. On a year-to-date basis, our production averaged 2.68 million barrels per day. Third quarter 2011 was an obvious low in production for us. We do expect to see notably increased production during the fourth quarter on the order of 100,000 to 150,000 barrels per day. The key drivers of this increase are, in Thailand, pipeline repairs are complete and our production has been fully restored. In addition, we will see new production during the fourth quarter, as our Platong II asset quickly ramps up. In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect to see improved production as hurricane season comes to an end, and from Perdido as a result of recent facility modifications. In Kazakhstan, we expect a strong fourth quarter at TCO now that major turnarounds are complete and because we normally see higher production during cooler weather. And our other significant annual turnarounds are essentially complete. Looking beyond the quarter, I want to remind you of our long-term guidance. At the end of 2009, we said we would grow production on average 1% per year through 2014 and then grow 4% to 5% thereafter. For the first 2 years, we are doing that, and I'm reaffirming our original guidance now. With the strength and scale of our major capital projects and our strong base business performance, we continue to expect production to grow to 3.3 million barrels per day by 2017. We are advancing the queue, reaching critical milestones and are well-placed to deliver consistent growth and performance over the long term. Turning to Slide 10. U.S. Downstream earnings improved $140 million in the third quarter. Indicator margins weakened between quarters, decreasing earnings by $225 million. Refining and marketing margins for both the Gulf Coast and West Coast weakened relative to last quarter. On the West Coast, inventories lingered above seasonal averages and for both the West and Gulf Coast, gasoline demand declined at the end of peak driving season. However, realized margins strengthened between quarters, increasing earnings by $250 million. Pascagoula and El Segundo refineries both benefited from running more economic crude slates during the quarter. Higher produced volumes increased earnings by $30 million, driven mainly by the absence of second quarter maintenance. The Other bar consists of several unrelated items, including lower OpEx and stronger trading results. On Slide 11, international Downstream earnings were also higher this quarter, increasing $802 million from second quarter's results. Refining and marketing margins benefited earnings by $55 million due to improved Korean marketing margins and continued strong Asian demand. Gains on asset sales improved earnings by $490 million. This includes the Pembroke Refinery and related marketing facilities in the U.K. and Ireland. Positive foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $240 million, primarily in our affiliates. Third quarter's foreign exchange gain was about $145 million compared to the second quarter loss of about $95 million. The Other bar includes a number of unrelated items. Slide 12 covers All Other. Third quarter charges were $358 million compared to a net $183 million charge in the second quarter, an increase of $175 million between periods. An unfavorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in $167 million variance, and corporate charges were slightly higher by $8 million in the third quarter. Year-to-date, All Other charges were $929 million. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. Mike is now going to provide an update on our Downstream operations. Mike?\nMichael Wirth: Thanks, Jeanette. I'm pleased to have an opportunity to update everyone on our Downstream performance. We continue to focus on improving returns through a relentless commitment to operating safely and reliably, and driving improvements through all our business operations. Please turn to Slide 14. I'd like to start with an update in the area of reliability where we now have 2010 Solomon data. This comprehensive biannual third-party benchmarking survey shows that Chevron ranked #1 among major competitors in refinery utilization for the third consecutive period. Reliable operations are the foundation of competitiveness, and the reduction of unplanned shutdowns enabled us to capture maximum value from our installed capacity. I've talked to you for years now about our commitment to reliability, and this independent assessment shows the results of that commitment. I'm extremely proud of this outcome, as it demonstrates our sustained leadership in an essential measure of operational excellence. Year-to-date 2011, we've delivered utilization rates at close to 2010 levels, and our people are focused on continuing to sustain this level of performance. Please turn to Slide 15. In March, I updated you on the progress of our organizational restructuring to lower our costs. At that time, we delivered a reduction in headcount of some 20% versus a year-end 2008 baseline, largely through work simplification and streamlining. As of the end of the third quarter, we now stand at a reduction of 34% or 6,300 people, mostly outside of the U.S. This continued progress reflects portfolio rationalization and our significant efforts to keep our cost structure lean and competitive. On the right-hand side of this chart, you see an update of our commitment to improve refining performance by $700 million by the end of next year. More than a year ahead of schedule, we have exceeded our target and captured $750 million in annual improvements. We've optimized a number of individual units across multiple refineries, which have increased yield, lowered blend cost and reduced lesser-value product streams. At the same time, modest investments and mechanical improvements have allowed us to lower energy, water treatment and catalyst costs. We'll use 2010 Solomon data to confirm the impact of these improvements and to establish targets for additional improvement. Please turn to Slide 16. I'd also like to update you on our efforts to high-grade and simplify our portfolio to improve focus, efficiency and returns. We've made continued progress this year, including 21 more country exits, primarily in Africa, the Caribbean and Central America, 8 logistics asset divestments, including 6 terminals in the United States and the sale of our U.K. and island Refining and Marketing assets, including the Pembroke Refinery. And we still have a number of other portfolio actions in progress. We've signed sales agreements in Spain and Africa and are in final negotiations for the sale of additional assets in the Caribbean. Since beginning this portfolio work in 2005, we've generated more than $8 billion in cash as a result of these actions. Turning to Slide 17. We're also optimizing our business line focus moving investment into higher-return business segments. I'd like to highlight 4 important lubricants and chemicals projects. In Saudi Arabia, Chevron Phillips Chemical's Saudi Polymer Company achieved mechanical completion and is on track to start up a 1.2 million ton per year ethylene cracker and associated derivative units. We reached a Final Investment Decision to fund a 25,000-barrel per day Pascagoula base oil plant, which, when completed in 2013, will make us the world's leading supplier of premium base oil. We plan to expand our Oronite specialty chemicals plant in Singapore, already the largest additives plant in the Asia-Pacific region, to increase supply capability in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market. FID is scheduled for next year. And Chevron Phillips Chemicals is conducting a feasibility study of a world-scale ethane cracker on the U.S. Gulf Coast that would utilize advantage feed made available by the development of shale gas resources. CPChem has a very strong existing position in this market, with a competitive advantage and the ability to run a lighter feed slate with more ethane than the industry, in general. On top of that, they've got excellent infrastructure and logistics capabilities and are one of the first in the industry to advance plans for new cracker investments. With multiple facilities in the region and a proven track record of capability and performance, we're confident that CPChem has a leg up on the right kind of project to deliver strong returns. We'll keep you advised as this project progresses. Turning to Slide 18. In summary, we continue to operate safely and reliably and are delivering very competitive financial results. With year-to-date adjusted earnings per barrel of $3.15 and a return on capital employed of 19%, we've come a long way in the last 2 years. Our relative competitive performance on these 2 measures was strong in 2010 and continues to be strong this year where we stand #1 on earnings per barrel and #2 on ROCE after 9 months. We've got the right strategies and are executing on our commitments. I'm confident we'll continue to deliver excellent performance in the quarters to come. With that, I'd like to turn it over back to Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thanks, Mike. Now turning to Slide 19. I'd like to close out with a few highlights of Chevron's strategic progress during the quarter. Mike just covered our Downstream progress. Clearly, our plans to improve the competitiveness of our Downstream operations are well on track. Let me cover some of the highlights on Upstream now. Most recently, we achieved first production at Platong II in the Gulf of Thailand. This natural gas project is expected to ramp up to 330 million cubic feet per day, and it will also produce about 18,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids. We made Final Investment Decisions on a number of major capital projects this quarter. In Australia, we sanctioned the Wheatstone LNG project, which along with the Gorgon project, positions us to be one of the world's leading LNG suppliers. Project cost estimates for Wheatstone is $29 billion. It is a 2-train, 8.9 million-ton per year LNG facility and a domestic gas plant. We currently have about 60% of our equity LNG under long-term sales agreements. In the North Sea, the second phase of the Clair Ridge development received the green light. This project is expected to cost $7.1 billion and will extend peak production and increased recovery from the Clair Ridge field. We also sanctioned the Tubular Bells project in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. First production from this $2.3 billion oil & gas development is expected in 2014, with peak production at 40,000 to 45,000 barrels per day oil equivalent. Our exploration activities have accelerated throughout the year. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we recently announced the Moccasin oil discovery and spud our Coronado well. We also spud a pre-salt well in Angola. And in offshore China, we have just begun drilling our first well in the Deepwater Pearl River Mouth Basin. In Australia, we announced the discovery at Acme West, and we have just spud our Vos well. We are also progressing our global shale activity with our first well currently drilling in Canada's Duvernay and with an imminent spud of our first well in Poland. It's clear that we're in a growth phase through mid-decade. You'll see this on the long-term production slide Jeanette reviewed earlier with you, and it is reinforced as I run through these strategic milestones, where we're evaluating newly captured acreage and continuing to sanction new development projects. We have indicated previously that our medium-term C&E requirements would be robust, a direct result of having such a healthy and, frankly, enviable development queue. For 2012, I'm not in a position just yet to offer a firm C&E target. But you should expect a noticeable increase from current spending levels. We will be reviewing our investment plans with our Board in just a few weeks, and we will be announcing the 2012 target investment figure, most likely in the first week of December. In closing, the company is operating very well. Our financial performance is quite strong. Our strategies are the right ones, and we're executing well against them. Our shareholders are benefiting from both growing dividends and an expanding share repurchase program. We're truly excited about the value-creation opportunities ahead for us. We're committed to delivering disciplined growth and shareholder value for a long time to come. So that now concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] So now, Sean, if you could open up the lines for questions, we'll get started.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nEdward Westlake: Very strong cash flow again this quarter. Just a quick question. If you've taken FID on Wheatstone and Tubular Bells, I mean, people out there do question the returns on perhaps the initial phases of Wheatstone and the Tubular Bells project. Clearly, Wheatstone's more strategic. But, I mean, what would you say that the people might be missing when you think about the returns for both of those projects?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I think actually, both of the projects are strongly economic. I mean, we did mention the strategic aspect around Wheatstone, and there's a prospect of brownfield expansion beyond the initial commitments that we have made. We continue to be very successful in the Australian Basin in finding gas. I think we've announced 11 discoveries over the last couple of years. So obviously, it's a very prolific basin. So that will have strong returns for a very long time to come. At the same time, the Gulf of Mexico is a strategic basin for us as well, and the economics on Tubular Bells look strong. They're competitive in our portfolio.\nEdward Westlake: And maybe specifically on Wheatstone, obviously, $29 billion total CapEx. How quickly are you going to be able to get spend going into, say, 2012?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I think that our project team was waiting for the Final Investment Decision to be made, and they are very anxious and ready, and in fact, are ramping up as we speak, Ed. So I would expect there to be a significant ramp-up there in 2012 for Wheatstone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Y. Cheng: A couple of questions. First for RNM [ph] my -- other than say, the pending sales in Spain, Africa and Caribbean, you're largely done with the portfolio restructuring or do you still have significant more to go? And also, if you can give a comment about Richmond, whether that we're going to see any progress on the upgrading there? And then also that with the Eagle Ford the increasing NGL  and the condensate production, have you guys looked at whether it you makes sense in Pascagoula or some of your facility adding a condensate splitter to take advantage on that?\nMichael Wirth: Okay, Paul. I'll take those in order. First of all, on the portfolio, we've tried to lay out for you on an annual basis the large portfolio actions that are underway or the clusters of geographies. And as I mentioned Spain and a little bit of Africa still is pending, with some deals signed and yet to close. We're negotiating on businesses in the Caribbean, still, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, a number of the other islands in the Caribbean and would expect to have deals on those signed before the end of this year and close next year. Beyond that, we'll always continue to review our portfolio for competitiveness, but I think the big work will be complete in 2012. And if we've got any other things that we anticipate doing here in the near term, you'll probably hear about them in March. But we're winding this down towards the portfolio that we really believe is right for us and will allow us to deliver sustained, very competitive returns. On Richmond, you know the history, so I won't reprise that. We continue to be committed to investing under the right circumstances in a project there. In May of this year, we submitted an application to the City of Richmond restarting the environmental review process and taking clear note of the deficiencies in the prior process that were noted by the judge in the lawsuit. We've scaled it back. We initially had a significantly larger set of projects that we were undertaking and moving through the permitting process. Other revised project will only complete the replacement of very old hydrogen plant equipments and give us the ability to use that hydrogen, both on site at the refinery and to export some of it to other users. We have removed the catalytic -- a continuous cat reformer project and some other power plants' replacement projects. So we've scaled it back. And the other point I would make is, it doesn't really change the basic function of the refinery. What it does is it allows the refinery to remain competitive by replacing older equipment with newer, cleaner technologies to reduce emissions and improve efficiency. We've got some of the toughest environmental laws in the world in California, and the Richmond Refinery is one of the most efficient and low-emitting refineries that we have. So we believe that this is a sound project, and frankly, shouldn't be as controversial as it has become. I can't speculate on when we're going to receive permits or when construction would continue. So we'll keep you advised as we go through that process. Finally, on Pascagoula, Pascagoula's got a big coker, and we're investing in a lube oil plant there. And so it has very good product flexibility and it's got good crude flexibility in terms of taking in heavier, more sour crudes to take advantage of the discounts there. We are undertaking some further crude flexibility work to bring in other higher-viscosity crudes, higher-asset crudes, but have not undertaken anything relative to a condensate splitter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDouglas George Blyth Leggate: Pat, if I can take my full course of 2 hopefully quick ones. First of all, I appreciate the update from Jeanette on timing and/or at least on capital I should say on the production outlook. However, can you reiterate or reaffirm the timing on Gorgon, because we're hearing chatter of Australia that things might have slipped behind schedule, both on a budget and on a timing basis, if you could reaffirm that? And my quick follow-up I guess, taking advantage of Mike, being on the line here. Mike, it looks like, at least on our model, when we look at top tier rates on the International business and particularly in the U.S. business, that based relative to your indicator margins, things seem to have kind of deteriorated a little bit versus what you were able to capture obviously from same assets. I'm just wondering if something has changed notably there that you can share with us, and I'll leave it at that.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. I'll take the first one there on Gorgon. We are reaffirming our timing of Gorgon, which would include production, first production at the end of 2014. I think we've been pretty transparent about some of the weather-related delays that we had initially on when 8 cyclones went through before we had much of the site prep work done. That has been resolved. We've now got the housing facilities that are cyclone-proof. So should there be bad weather again, we won't have to demobilize people on and off and remobilize people on and off the island. We've actually make tremendous progress over the last several months. The materials offloading facility is ready for service. That will make the logistics moving quite easy. I mentioned the housing is really already 80% of it's there and occupied. We've got the tankage being built, we have the wells being drilled. So there's really tremendous progress that's being made on Gorgon. And to the extent that you hear some chatter about scheduled slippage, as you know, we continue -- there are critical path items and noncritical path items on any major project schedule, and we feel very secure that our critical path items are right on plan.\nMichael Wirth: Doug, on the question on capture rates, I don't know exactly what your model is showing you. In the third quarter, we had a very good quarter. In fact, in the U.S., you saw some significant margin deterioration. The West Coast refining margins were off by $3 a barrel or more, when we saw some reductions on the Gulf Coast as well. Actually, West Coast was down 5 and the Gulf Coast was down 3. We were actually able to capture that back and claw it back. And likewise, internationally, we ran pretty well. Earlier in the year, and so if you're looking at year-to-date, we did have some issues in the first and particularly the second quarter with some extended turnarounds at one of our facilities in the fire and another one that took a crude generator offline for a while that had us running slightly different than we normally would in selling out intermediates and buying intermediates, which is some things that can chew into your margins, while you're operating like that. So earlier in the year, we did have some challenges. But in the third quarter, we did well and there's nothing material that's changed in terms of our ability to continue to be competitive in that regard.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie Capital.\nJason Gammel: First of all, I wanted to ask a question about Australia with the incremental exploration success patent. If you could update us on what you think the resource base that you have captured in Australia is and sort of contrast that with what I imagine to be about 23 TCFs you'd need to back up the 2 projects that are currently under construction or at least approved. And then a very specific one for Mike. Mike, you had mentioned a couple of years ago a technology that you were piloting in Pascagoula was a vacuum-resid, hydro-cracking process with near 100% clean product yield. How is that process going? Is that something that you think could be commercialized?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. First one on Gorgon. Actually, Jason, I wish I had a slide in front of me that I'd just refer you back to. George showed a slide at our Security Analyst Meeting back in March where he talked to the incremental gas quantities being found and the points in time, over time, when we have sanctioned these various projects. And what you continue to see is that we continue to find additional resources, both that can support an additional Train 4 around Gorgon and then also potentially supporting additional trains around Wheatstone. So we don't -- I don't have any incrementally new number to advise you of that. I'd suggest that you go back and pull out that slide and know that we have continued to have major success since March. And that George, I'm sure, will update you in March with some rendition of that slide. But obviously, it's a very prolific gas basin, and we're very encouraged about the exploration success that we continue to have.\nMichael Wirth: And Jason, on the technology that we talked about a few years back, we continue to mature that in a pilot plants and to very good results. We looked very hard at a couple of different locations at a precommercial plant that would run at a few thousand barrels a day, and prove it up so that we could scale it up. The capital costs on that were pretty significant. And at a time when we've got a lot of other value-creating capital opportunities in our queue, and the questions today have been about a number of those, we are prioritizing our activity, and this one really at the scale it would take for us to answer the next set of questions, as we manage our way through capital spend, it just doesn't stack up. So we've got the technology, we've got it well covered with IP protection, and we'll maintain it. But at this point, we have chosen not to proceed to the next step of scale up on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nJohn P. Herrlin: Two quick ones. With Angola, will that be a fourth quarter TD or first quarter on the pre-salt well?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I don't know. I mean, it just started drilling. So I don't think you're talking about a fourth quarter outcome here. I think you're really talking much, much into or early into 2012.\nJohn P. Herrlin: Okay. That's fine. With Wheatstone, Pat, can you address what your reserve bookings might be? I mean, initially you started out with a small amount for projects that are sanctioned offshore. I was wondering if you were willing to give an order of magnitude.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I'm not willing to give an order of magnitude. We'll do that obviously with our year-end reports. But having sanctioned Wheatstone and the fact that it is an LNG project will mean that you should see a sizable reserve booking this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: I'll give you 2 questions, one Downstream and one on exploration. A question for Mike on your near-term refining outlook. A good quarter, good Downstream quarter, by the way. As I look at the European inventory, both diesel and crude at 7- and 5-year lows U.S. day cover 5 lows, steep backwardation in the product market. I was wondering what your perspective was in the near-term distillate markets, as well as what you're seeing in Asia where there's, frankly, inventory and demand data are a little less transparent. And on the Japan cargo side, if we could give comments there the last time you were on the call as well.\nMichael Wirth: Okay. So I'll take that one, and we'll take your follow-up question. Yes, so right now, sentiment seems to swing. We had some optimism about the announcements out of Europe earlier this week, but I think overall in the OECD, the demand side and the overall economic situation continues to be problematic. And so, there is some risk. Now you've gone to the part of the barrel where things look better, which is distillate. Japanese diesel demand looks to be up pretty sharply. We saw -- we've seen a strong draw in stocks in Japan in October. There's some talk, and you're right in China, things are less transparent. But some talk that diesel maybe a little bit on the short end there right now. And certainly, as you look at the data here for the U.S., the implied diesel demand, including exports, which have become a regular part of the mix here, it's above the 5-year average. We're well into the harvest season and moving into cooler weather. So there's a number of supportive factors for distillate demands right now. And the spreads reflect that, if you look at the NYMEX right now, diesel, this commands quite a healthy premium to gasoline. Gasoline markets look weak right now, high prices. Demand has been struggling to stay within range of what we saw a year ago here in the U.S. And so, the gasoline part of the barrel continues to be pretty week. I think in Asia, it's a mix, as always. There's a quote from Lee Kuan Yew that Asians are a figment of the Western imagination. I think in places like China and Singapore, it look very, very strong. And Thailand and the Philippines right now are really struggling with weather. And the impact of the floods in Thailand and a couple of typhoons that took a pretty direct shot at the large demand centers in the Philippines, and then there's other parts of Asia like Japan, where demand continues to be pretty weak. So overall, I think China remains the big story, and I think distillate is the part of the barrel that we continue to see the strength in.\nEvan Calio: Great. That's great. My follow-up question is on exploration. I know that [indiscernible] and Block 0's been very prolific for Chevron. You kind of highlight the pre-salt well, and I think you drilled through that salt before to -- I think it's been less uniform. As you're highlighting that well, I presume it's a material well. I just wondered if you could -- is there something different or more perspective here, and then update on Liberia spud date, maybe Bear's Hump as well.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, Evan, there's not really much more I can offer on the Angola well. I mean, we'll just have to wait and see how that comes out. The Liberia spud date is later here in the fourth quarter. And that again, in 3 large blocks, it's the first well, highly perspective, or we hope it will be a highly perspective area. And Bear\u2019s Hump, the same kind of thing. Bear\u2019s Hump is still drilling, and we'll have to wait and see what the outcome there is. That's Gulf of Mexico deep gas, and we'll just have to wait and see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.\nMark Gilman: Mike, I got one for you relating to some of Jeanette's comments. In discussing the U.S. Downstream in the third quarter, she referenced a very, very sizable impact associated with, I think, she termed it a more economic crude slate. If you do the math on those numbers, that's a big figure on a per-barrel basis. Could you talk about what that's about and the sustainability of it? And in particular the extent to which it's associated with market factors as opposed to specific Chevron initiatives, and then I have a follow-up.\nMichael Wirth: Okay. So the thing that I think you ought to pay attention to in there is that it's a 2Q-to-3Q comparison, number one. Number two, it reflects some of the challenges I referenced earlier in that earlier in the year, we had some refineries that had some issues. So we had a fire at the Pascagoula, one of our crude units at Pascagoula, and in the second quarter, and so we were offline there, buying higher-priced intermediates and to keep the back-end conversion units full, we had some problems at El Segundo in the second quarter as well. In the third quarter, by contrast, everything ran extraordinarily well, and we had virtually no unanticipated issues to face. And we were able to optimize some spreads that had opened up in the market. We also have a couple of our refineries, they're smaller, Burnaby and Hawaii, that purchase a fair amount of their feedstock priced off of WTI. And while we don't have the big WTI exposure that some of the larger Mid-Continent refiners do, that's been a nontrivial factor for those refineries as well. So you have a number of issues, some of them market-related, some of them operations-related and some of them Chevron related, all of which moved significantly to the positive in Q3, a number of which were either not nearly as strong in Q2 or, given the operational challenges, actually negatives in Q2. So without trying to take you down into a detailed breakdown on that, Mark, I would tell you that you shouldn't bank on all of that as being kind of a sustainable kind of a way to beat the market. But there's certainly a chunk of that, that I think is.\nMark Gilman: Pat, you've been in the global LNG selling/contracting business for a while. I was wondering if you could just comment on the kind of trends you're seeing in the more recent LNG contracts in terms of such features as the slope, S-curve aspects and anything else you might want to comment on in terms of how that market is looking.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Actually, I mean, what we're seeing, frankly, is I would call it a strengthening of the midterm LNG market, really with fallout from the Fukushima circumstance. And so I would say in the medium term, it's been a stronger market. So I think you can get an indication of what the various slopes have been from various publications. I don't want to go into specifics there, but I think the contracts, we're not working on it, off of the curve interpretation, and we feel very comfortable about where we stood commercially. We have additional volumes that we can still place with Wheatstone and Gorgon, frankly, and we are in discussions with numerous buyers on that. And we feel very optimistic about our ability to find quality buyers at very good commercial terms.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.\nBlake Fernandez: I had 2 quick ones for you. One, I wanted to clarify the production comments. If I'm not mistaken, the guidance last quarter was for full year volumes of 2.7 million, 3 million barrels per day. And if I heard the correct number for ramp up in 4Q of 100 to 150, it seems like you may come in a bit light according to my arithmetic. I'm just trying to confirm, is that the case?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I think that's a fair assessment, yes.\nBlake Fernandez: Okay. And then secondly, as we kind of look ahead to CapEx, I realize you'll be giving some details in December, but in our efforts to try and quantify what that could be, when we look at Wheatstone, your 73% working interest I believe.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes.\nBlake Fernandez: Can you give us any clue for where you expect that number to ultimately land? Or are you maintaining that level?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: You mean, in terms of our equity ownership?\nBlake Fernandez: Correct.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes. I mean, we do anticipate a further sell down here. That's our expectation, yes.\nBlake Fernandez: Is there a targeted percentage level that we should be thinking about, maybe?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: You mean in terms of our overall ownership?\nBlake Fernandez: Yes, right. How low do you want to get?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I think that really depends on commercial discussions that are underway here. And I think having a proportionality in a 70%-ish range works well for us. I don't want to get any more specific than that, I think.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Iain Reid with Jefferies.\nIain Reid: I got a couple of questions for Mike, actually. Kind of firstly, just sort of a big picture one on the Downstream, Mike. If you kind of step back to 2009 and look at where you've come in terms of improvements in your Downstream earnings, if you split that between the portfolio actions you've done in cost reduction and kind of new investment, how would that improvement kind of break down? I'm also interested in about how you see in kind of a constant margin environment that's improving in the future?\nMichael Wirth: So that's something in March that I'll update everybody on, because we laid out some pretty specific targets against our 2009 performance, and I just don't have a breakdown in front of me right now. I would tell you from a big-picture standpoint, we've certainly seen margins better than what we experienced in 2009. So a portion of what you've seen in the Downstream is due to improved fundamentals out there in the marketplace. But we have made sizable cost reductions. I spoke to you a third reduction in headcount. We have reduced our positions in a lot of countries around the world where, frankly, we worked hard to not take a lot home. And we're coring up into the areas where we really have competitive strength. So the cost side of it in the portfolio side had been very important. The other part is reliability, and I talked to you about our utilization rates. And we are running our assets extremely well and better than our competitors are. And you take whatever the market has to offer you. And if you can continue to run reliably, you can be very, very competitive. So there are contributions from the market that are nontrivial, but there's a big, big piece of self-help that I'll talk about when we're back in New York again in March. I just don't have a specific breakdown for you this morning. I do think that the self-help piece is intended to be sustainable. And in the Downstream, it's a margin business. The competition is tough, and hanging on to the improvement is always a challenge, which is why we continually reset targets to get even better. And I made reference to that today in our refining system.\nIain Reid: Okay. My second question's about [indiscernible] I just wonder whether you've got any concerns about the new kind of co-owner, which you're going to have there some time in next year. And whether there's any plans for any change into the way the joint venture is set up?\nMichael Wirth: This joint venture's been very successful over the decade that it's been in place and Philips and then ConocoPhillips has been a very good partner, and we've been well-aligned. I think that they've indicated they intend this to go to their Downstream company. The CEO of that Downstream company has been announced, and he happens to be the former CEO of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. So he's a strong leader, and somebody who we know well and have a good relationship with. We are having discussions with them to ensure that we remain aligned. But I can tell you that in the boardroom and in shareholder discussions with them, we see more alignment than we see differences, that's for sure. They will be a smaller company, and they will be a company that is purely exposed to the fundamentals of the Downstream business. And so that could become an issue over time, but we'll just have to see how that plays out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: Mike, could I ask you about Californian crude pricing and feedstock pricing from the point of view of your position as a major producer and consumer there? I'm just thinking that things are shifting over time quite dramatically in California.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, without knowing exactly what you're referring to, I will tell you as an equity producer of heavy crude in the San Joaquin Valley, we are seeing strong pricing for that crude today. So as an Upstream producer, we're enjoying the demand for that crude. And you match that up with where domestic natural gas prices are, and our steam flood there is quite economic at these kinds of natural gas prices. So it's a good place to be. There's strong demand for that crude. We've got options with both pipeline connections to those fields and the ability to bring in cargoes from other markets to support our Upstream ones with good strong runs of our equity heavy crudes and to keep our refinery competitive by taking advantage of opportunities to bring in South American heavies, for instance, into El Segundo. So it's been a market that I think has been good for our Upstream, and it hasn't been bad for our Downstream business.\nPaul Sankey: Yes. I mean, you're heading exactly where I wanted you to. On the San Joaquin, I was just wondering you said it's the demand affect that's causing the big premium that we're seeing relative to historical premiums.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, I mean, people are set up to run these heavy crudes, and not just our refinery but other refineries that are connected to it. And with some of the demand you see in Asia that is pulling some of the heavy crudes to Asia. The options have changed and the reliance on certain feedstocks, particularly when you're tied to a pipeline where you can get it in, is something that you have to confront as a refiner. So I do think you've seen some shifting dynamics there, which put a little more pressure on the refiners to be sure that they're as good as they can be, and it's been healthy for our Upstream.\nPaul Sankey: Sure. Has it -- I know it's an Upstream question, but have you been suffering permitting issues, offsetting that benefit?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: In San Joaquin Valley are you talking, Paul? No, we haven't. I mean, we obviously work very closely with the regulators, but we haven't seen any sort of negative impact associated with the additional regulatory oversight there.\nMichael Wirth: Not out of the normal for California.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well said, Mike, yes.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. Great. And then my second if I could, Pat, to you. I know you hate it when I describe it as a war chest, but it is notable that you've got over $10 billion. You've obviously done the dividend step-up, which I guess is very unusual for you to raise twice in a year. I'm not sure you have done it, frankly. Why not more buyback in Q4?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, Paul. I mean, I guess it's coming down to I guess, no matter how you give the cash away, people aren't -- not everybody's happy all the time. We felt very good about the second quarter -- the second time in a year dividend increased. We have done it in the past. Typically, when you have seen a significant run-up in commodity prices in a short period of time, that's really what we saw here in 2011. So our cash balance for 2011 is coming in much stronger than we thought it would be at the beginning of the year. And the dividend increase was really intended to signal confidence in our current position, as well as our future cash-generating position. We do look at the share repurchases every quarter. We do run through that sort of discussion with the Board. And at this particular time, the preference is given over to dividends. We think that actually sends a stronger signal about the performance of the company presently and really on a go-forward basis, because we view it as a permanent increase. And all I can say is we will continue to look every quarter at the cash balance, and we'll look at our medium-term outlook on prices, margins, C&E requirements. I did signal that we would have a more noticeable uptick in C&E in 2012, relative to current spending. So all of that gets taken into account when we look at the share repurchase decision.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar.\nAllen Good: Just had a question on -- you mentioned the Duvernay. I was just questioning any other activity as far as unconventional on lower 48 or even in Canada as far as acreage adds go during the quarter?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Not during the quarter, no. I mean, we've continued to add significantly in unconventional properties over the course of the last 12 and 18 months. And we've been pretty descriptive about what all those properties were. I think some 15 million acres in total added over that period of time for all acreage, of which certainly unconventional gas is a portion of that.\nAllen Good: Okay. And then just one for Mike. It looks like last week, California regulators voted to move ahead with some sort of carbon market in California by 2013. I was just wondering what you see the impact for Chevron there? Do you  think you're going to see increased costs? Or is that something more that we would be passed along to the consumer?\nMichael Wirth: It's a great question. California has decided to go it alone -- or largely alone here on the climate change. The benchmark calculations are still not clear. The first compliance period is 2013 through 2014. Transportation fuels are not included in the first compliance period, which is where a real consumer pass-through issue will absolutely exist. And so at this point, and I think in the early portion of the program, we feel like because we have very efficient facilities and have invested in energy efficiency, that we can manage our way through the beginning. But I have to tell you just a few facts. I mean, California energy prices are some of the highest in the nation, whether you're talking about electricity or fuels. By policy, this is designed to drive prices higher. And at some point, businesses have to confront that as to the consumers of those businesses' products. And in a state where the economy is challenged, where employment is challenged and with a fiscal situation that is unsustainable, I think the effects here are predictable. And so there are -- we're on a policy path in California that I think is going to need to be addressed by policymakers over time.\nOperator: Okay, our final question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: A very quick one if I may. I believe the last resource estimates for the Wheatstone fields was given back in 2008. Given the discovery since then, I'm curious what kind of color you can give on the current resource base?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, Pavel, I don't have a number handy. Again, I hate to -- the next time I come into the call, I'll bring that slide. There is a slide that George showed that talked about the entire Australian resource opportunity. I just have to refer you to that, and we will update that slide come March, because we have had additional success. But I don't have a specific number for you here today. Okay, thank you very much. I think that concludes our discussion here this morning. And let me thank everybody for their participation on the call today. I want to thank particularly those who asked questions, because I think it enlarges the debate and the understanding for everybody. So thank you, everyone. I appreciate your interest in Chevron.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2011, "date": "2011-07-29 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay. Thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President of Upstream and Gas; and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager, Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2011. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $7.7 billion or $3.85 per diluted share. Comparing the second quarter 2011 to the same quarter a year earlier, our earnings were up 43%. Upstream benefited from higher crude oil prices, and Downstream benefited from improved margins. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was over 19%. Our debt ratio at the end of June was 9.1%. In the second quarter, we had share repurchases of $1 billion. Effective for the third quarter and reflecting the strength in crude prices and of our current near-term outlook, we are increasing the upper end of our target range on share repurchases to $2 billion. In the third quarter, we expect share repurchases of $1.25 billion. Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was nearly $11 billion during the second quarter. This is a new record for the company, topping last quarter's performance. Year-to-date, we have used this strong cash flow in a manner completely consistent with our established financial priorities. We raised the dividend in the second quarter by 8%. We've funded a strong capital program and made some modest acquisitions. Both the organic and the inorganic components of these outlays are poised to earn attractive returns and drive future growth for the company. We've also continued to strengthen our balance sheet, and we've returned surplus cash to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled nearly $18 billion. This puts us in a net cash position of $6.5 billion. Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.\nJeanette Ourada: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 5. I'll compare results of the second quarter 2011 with the first quarter 2011. As a reminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2011 with the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter earnings were $7.7 billion, $1.5 billion higher than the first quarter. Starting on the left side of the chart, Upstream earnings were up $894 million driven by higher crude oil realizations. Downstream results increased $422 million between quarters, benefiting from improved margins. The variance in the other bar reflects a favorable swing in corporate tax items and lower corporate charges. On Slide 6, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the second quarter were $501 million higher than the first quarter's results. Combined crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $420 million. U.S. crude realizations increased 17% between consecutive quarters, well above the 8% increase in the average spot price of West Texas Intermediate. As a reminder, our U.S. crude realizations are tied primarily to Mars, Louisiana Light Sweet and San Joaquin Valley heavy crudes, all of which traded at premiums to WTI during the second quarter. Natural gas realizations also improved, increasing 8% between quarters, slightly higher than the 5% increase in the average Henry Hub bid week. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $55 million between periods, reflecting higher costs related to maintenance activities across multiple assets, including more workovers. The higher expenses also reflect a full quarter of operations for our new Marcellus assets. The other bar is comprised of a number of unrelated items, including gains on several small asset sales and higher volumes due to an additional day between quarters. Turning to Slide 7. International Upstream earnings were up $393 million compared with the first quarter. Higher oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $875 million. Average liquids realizations increased 12%, in line with the increase in average Brent Spot Prices. Natural gas realizations contributed $70 million of the variance, improving 9% between quarters. This improvement was driven by price increases in our primary Asian gas markets, which have crude-linked pricing components. Higher operating expense decreased earnings $205 million. The increase was spread across multiple geographic areas and included higher environmental remediation expense and higher maintenance and fuel costs. You'll recall that last year on our third quarter call, we highlighted our expectation of a 2011 full year increase in reported operating expense of approximately $1 billion due to a new Indonesian agreement where we sell oil and purchase natural gas. Previously, we handled this through a volume exchange. There is no bottom line earnings impact and no impact on production. Year-to-date, our reported operating expense number is up $1.3 billion. Of that, $900 million is from the new Indonesian agreement. At current year-to-date prices, we would expect the full year impact to be approximately $1.8 billion. Moving to the next bar. Higher exploration expense reduced earnings by $140 million, primarily due to a well write-off in the U.K. and higher G&G cost associated with increased exploration activity. The other bar reflects a number of items, including unfavorable tax effects and higher DD&A, partially offset by a favorable swing in foreign exchange and higher listings. The second quarter had a foreign exchange gain of about $30 million compared to a loss of about $115 million in the first quarter. These foreign exchange effects have minimal impact on cash. They are primarily balance sheet translation effects. Moving to Slide 8, summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Production decreased 66,000 barrels per day between quarters. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts during the second quarter, decreasing production about 8,000 barrels per day. As a reminder, last quarter, we began using Brent to calculate a price effect rate as it is more closely tied to our international realizations. Average Brent Spot Prices increased about $12 per barrel between quarters, which resulted in about a 700 barrel per day volume reduction for each dollar increase in Brent. Recall that over a range of prices, this rate is not linear. As prices rise, the production impact per dollar change in Brent decreases. Moving to the next bar. Base business production decreased 66,000 barrels per day, largely driven by maintenance activity in Kazakhstan, Thailand and the Gulf of Mexico and lower cost recovery in Trinidad. This bar also reflects a positive impact from a full quarter of Marcellus production and absence of first quarter's weather impacts. Incremental production for major capital projects benefited second quarter production by 8,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by less downtime in Canada and continued ramp ups at Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico and Tombua-Landana in Angola. George will discuss our current year production outlook in a few minutes. Turning to Slide 9. U.S. Downstream earnings improved $122 million in the second quarter. Indicator margins strengthened between quarters, increasing earnings by $215 million. Refining and marketing margins for both the Gulf Coast and West Coast improved relative to last quarter, benefiting from higher seasonal demand for gasoline. Refined product margins also showed some strength early in the quarter as supplies in some areas were affected by refinery maintenance. However, both these factors lessened and margins generally slipped as the quarter progressed. Operating expenses reduced earnings by $35 million, driven mainly by higher third-party credit card fees and transportation costs. The other bar consists of several unrelated items, including lower volumes, partly offset by improved chemicals and trading results. On Slide 10, international Downstream earnings were also higher this quarter, increasing $300 million from first quarter's results. Refining and marketing margins rose in all key regions, benefiting earnings by $165 million. Timing effects represented a $155 million positive earnings variance between quarters. First quarter had a negative $195 million impact with a smaller impact of negative $40 million in the second quarter. The primary driver was favorable mark-to-market effects on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions. Negative foreign currency effects impacted earnings by $55 million. Second quarter's foreign exchange loss was about $95 million compared to the first quarter loss of $40 million. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items, including improved trading and chemical results partly offset by lower volumes. Slide 11 covers all other. Second quarter net charges were $183 million compared to a net $388 million charge in the first quarter, a decrease of $205 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $151 million benefit to earnings. Corporate charges were $54 million lower in the second quarter. Year-to-date, corporate charges were $571 million. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. George is now going to provide an update on our Upstream operations. George?\nGeorge Kirkland: Thank you, Jeanette. It's good to be back to discuss Upstream performance and our production outlook for the remainder of the year. I'd like to begin by looking at our second quarter competitive position on earnings markets. Please turn to Slide 13. In the second quarter, Upstream margins were approximately $29 per barrel, another excellent quarter reinforcing the strength of our oil-weighted portfolio and the high quality of our assets. Based on competitor results disclosed this week, we continue to lead our peers in this key metric. In the second quarter, we are nearly $8 per barrel ahead of our nearest competitor and over $10 per barrel higher than the peer group average. In addition, we have now held the top position for 8 consecutive quarters. As you would expect, I'm very pleased with our leading position and our ability to sustain this performance over the past 2 years. While we are discussing margins, I'd like to make a brief comment on operating expense. Excluding fuel, our year-to-date OpEx is very consistent with our recent historical performance. This is a positive indicator for maintaining our peer-leading margins. Through the first half of the year, our return on capital employed was 32%. We've been making smart investment decisions for a long period of time, and we have now achieved the leading position in our peer group. We continue to deliver superior financial performance and to lead our competition on key operational and financial metrics. Now I'll turn to production. Please turn to Slide 14. The first half production averaged 2.73 million barrels a day, at the Brent price of $111 per barrel. Based on the year-to-date results and a Brent price of $111 per barrel, our revised full year production outlook is 2.73 million barrels per day. Adjusted to a $79 per barrel, this equates to 2.76 million barrels per day, a reduction from our original outlook of 30,000 barrels per day. This revised outlook is a result of 2 primary drivers: first, a recent incident in Thailand caused a key third-party gas pipeline to be shut down; and second, a slower-than-planned ramp up of the Perdido project in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The full year production impact of these 2 items is about 30,000 barrels per day, and they are approximately split between the 2. Outside these items, our major capital projects in total are performing as planned. Agbami in Nigeria, SGI/SGP in Kazakhstan and Frade in Brazil continue to deliver excellent results. Our base business performance has continued to be strong, offsetting the impacts of weather challenges earlier in the year. We have strong momentum entering the second half of the year, and we remain well positioned to deliver long-term growth. Now turning to Slide 15. We first showed you this slide last year. Through 2014, we forecast production to grow by approximately 1% per year. And starting in 2014, as our Australia LNG investments come on line and begin to ramp up toward full capacity, this growth rate is expected to increase to between 4% and 5%. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged. With the strength and scale of these projects and the depth of our portfolio, we expect our production to grow to 3.3 million barrels per day by 2017. Our growth projects are on track. We're advancing the queue. We're reaching critical milestones and are well-placed to deliver consistent growth and performance over the long term. Now let's review our 2011 exploration plans on Slide 16. We have an active year of exploration. We plan to invest over $2 billion, which includes the drilling of about 60 wells. We've returned to work in the Gulf of Mexico. We currently have 3 rigs drilling in the Deepwater, an appraisal well at Buckskin, an exploration well at Moccasin and a development well on the Tahiti 2 project. There is no doubt this past year has been a challenge for the Gulf of Mexico. I'm pleased with the recent progress we've made, which is a testament to the hard work of many people to get both Chevron and the industry back to work. In addition to our Deepwater activity, we're also drilling ahead at Bear's Hump. This is a key test of the ultra-deep Wilcox gas play on the Gulf of Mexico shelf. This well is also noteworthy, as we are drilling it from an onshore location. We think there's still a lot of potential on the Gulf, and it's not all located in the Deepwater. Chevron is well positioned in the lower tertiary play, both in the Deepwater and on the shelf. In Australia, we have 2 more exploration wells planned this year. One of them is an offset to the Acme discovery we announced last year. We've also been active in acquiring additional acreage, picking up 2 new leases near Barrow Island. The Carnarvon Basin is a key focus area for Chevron, with 10 discoveries over the last 18 months. We have an aggressive exploration program plan to underpin future expansions at Gorgon and Wheatstone. In Brazil, we plan to drill a well later this year in the free salt section beneath our Frade Field. If successful, we'll be in a great position to take advantage of our existing production facilities. We also have some exciting prospects in Liberia, China, Poland and Canada that we've discussed before. We plan to start drilling in all of these areas later this year. Next, on Slide 17, I'll highlight some of our recent activities in the Marcellus Shale. In February of this year, we closed on the acquisition of Atlas Energy and are currently working to complete the integration of these assets into our North America business. In May, we announced the acquisition of assets from Chief Oil and Gas and Tug Hill. Through these transactions, we added another 228,000 net acres of high-quality Marcellus Shale to our existing footprint. Largely focused in Southwestern Pennsylvania, the acreage includes over 30,000 acres of rich gas Marcellus in Marshall County, West Virginia. This expansion of our shale gas portfolio gives us additional high-quality resources, as well as strong synergies with existing operations. The acquired assets currently include 22 wells that are on production and an additional 34 wells waiting on completion or pipeline hookup. Combined with Atlas, this acreage is estimated to hold 14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources and is aligned with our strategy to pursue opportunities with long-term organic growth potential. Next, let's review progress in other key projects on the next slide. Expansion in the Caspian Pipeline has begun. This project will increase capacity to 1.4 million barrels per day from a current level of 730,000 barrels per day. It is a critical step forward in enabling a further expansion of our Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan. The project will be implemented in 3 phases with capacity increasing progressively from the period of 2012 to 2015. At Gorgon, we continue to make good progress on our critical path items, and they remain on track. We've begun horizontal directional drilling for pipeline installation, and we also started development drilling operations. Gorgon is presently 25% complete. At Wheatstone, we received additional environmental approvals and are selectively appealing certain conditions. In addition, we announced earlier this week that we have executed LNG sales and purchase agreements with Tokyo Electric for delivery of up to 3.1 million tons per annum of offtake. This is a significant milestone as we work toward a final investment decision in the second half of 2011. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we're making progress at Jack/St. Malo, where we've cut first steel on the hull and the top sides. And at Angola LNG, we're beginning to commission the utility systems and plan to start up subsequent process units throughout the rest of 2011. We're making good progress here and expect first production early next year. In addition, we've acquired more than 1 million acres of shale gas leasehold in Bulgaria. This continues to grow our position in eastern Europe. Around the world, we have now acquired nearly 5 million net acres of shale gas assets since late 2010. In summary, we've had a great quarter and a great first half of the year and are on track to deliver long-term growth. With that, I'd like now to turn it back to Pat.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay. Thank you, George. Turning now to Slide 19. I'd like to close out our prepared remarks with some highlights of Chevron's strategic progress during the quarter. George just gave you an update on recent progress in our Upstream business. We are back to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, and we continue to execute our major capital projects and to add new resource opportunities to our portfolio. In Downstream, we received government approval to proceed with the sale of our refining and marketing assets in Ireland and the U.K., including the Pembroke Refinery. We expect to close that sale next week. We are on track and progressing well with our Downstream restructuring plan. During the quarter, we completed several small asset sales in 3 Central American countries, as well as in China and North America. And finally, I'd like to make a few comments about the current discussions in Washington. Chevron is proud to be a healthy American company. We believe healthy companies are the cure for a sick economy. In the U.S., Chevron directly employs nearly 25,000 people with good jobs and good salaries. Indirectly, we support another 150,000 jobs. We plan to invest over $7 billion in the U.S. this year to expand energy supplies, which creates jobs and generates revenue for federal, state and local treasuries. We're proud to be part of an industry that is indispensable to economic growth and competitiveness. We want the opportunity to compete on a level playing field, both here at home and around the globe. And we look forward to working constructively under stable, predictable fiscal and regulatory policies to build a shared prosperity for America and for our shareholders. So that concludes our prepared remarks. We now welcome your questions. And Sean, I'd ask that you open the lineup. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.\nEdward Westlake: Maybe a first one on CapEx. $7.8 billion I guess includes the Marcellus acquisitions. Can you talk about maybe where you see underlying CapEx for the year against your plans and acquisition CapEx as well?\nPatricia Yarrington: It's a good question. You noted exactly correctly that the uptick we had in the second quarter did relate to some coring up of our Marcellus properties. That wasn't a planned item, but we saw the opportunity and took advantage of it. We don't anticipate being substantially different than where we set as a target $26 billion. We're halfway through the year. We're about 52% spent, and that looks to be in the reasonable range.\nEdward Westlake: And then maybe a question for George. There've been some high-profile cost at runs in Australia. We all know that. You're taking a modular approach to Gorgon, and I think you used the same modular approach on your SGI/SGP successful project in Kazakhstan. I mean, is that modular approach why you think Chevron is going to deliver Gorgon on budget where others have failed? And perhaps when do you think you'll be able to, with confidence, say that you're going to hit that project on budget?\nGeorge Kirkland: Ed, it is a great question. First, we did not use a modular approach in Tengiz on SGI/SGP. We are moving to a more modular approach for the future growth project in the next Tengiz expansion, and it's related to just what we've seen in Gorgon and what we see to be happening in Wheatstone. It's a wise thing to move ours and use ours in multiple places and the good -- only where you can do that is go to modules. So we are planning modules, significantly large modules on Gorgon. We will be using modular construction to, I think, a little bit lesser extent on Wheatstone but we'll be still driving towards modules there. And future growth will definitely move to modules as best we can in recognition of transportation infrastructure. But great question.\nEdward Westlake: And the second half of the question was really around -- with this modular approach at some point you'll see how productive the Australian workers are, in terms of being able to put these together, and you'll have some idea of where Gorgon CapEx will come in. When do you think that point will be reached?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, we've -- so far in the case of Gorgon about -- have about $25 billion in contracts in hand. The ones that are related to outside of Australia, we have a very good handle on them. We think that in itself mitigates the total cost. I don't expect to really have a good feel for productivity in Australia for at least another 12 months. I think at that point in time we'll have a good handle on the productivity situation. We're trying to put, of course, everything in place to guarantee good productivity on Barrow Island. We're doing really quality housing, providing great opportunity for good food. Doing all those things to make sure we have a good workforce that on-site and minimize issues for them, both from a safety, like I say, and a living basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: George, on that trip we were chatting about California, and you said you'd go back to your people and ask them for, I think, it's the third or fourth time if you're missing something there. Can you update me on your latest thoughts about California developments, their potential there and so on?\nGeorge Kirkland: Paul, we have went back. We're always looking at opportunities, particularly around where we have a big position. For those on the phone, we have about 250,000 acres in the southern California area of San Joaquin. We do produce from Monterey in southern California. We produce about 45,000 barrels a day in the Monterey. We are still doing some work, Paul, in that area. We have worked some of it in the upper part of the Monterey in the diatomite, we hold a lot of acreage in that, and we've seen success there. We've seen that in the Lost Hills. We are looking at some of the deeper Monterey, and we'll probably have a test of that in one of the areas we presently hold. At this point in time, we have not changed our overall view of the Monterey relative to our other opportunities in the world.\nPaul Sankey: Which is that it's relatively less interesting than some of the other developments you can see, obviously.\nGeorge Kirkland: We don't see it yet competing. We're going to do additional work there. We, typically, in all our areas where we have long-standing production, we're always looking for ways to increase the productivity of that resource, increase the recovery. And we see some cases of oil in plays that we're going to test. Now, it's once again, it's going to compete down the road for capital against our other opportunities around the world.\nPaul Sankey: Understood, George. And can you just be specific on why it's less attractive than other opportunities and also mention if there's any permitting issues for you there?\nGeorge Kirkland: I'll answer the second one first. We have not gone far enough to have the permitting issues, so we don't have any permitting issues. At this point, we just don't see the volumetric production that delivers enough barrels at a rate to make it economically competitive. But we've got more work to do. We're going to do a test that will tell us a little bit more about one of these lower formation areas in the Monterey. So more to come on that. I'm sure we'll have some feedback on that, additional feedback, even in the March time period of next year at our analyst meeting.\nPaul Sankey: Interesting. And then just a follow-up to finish off on the U.S. You've obviously highlighted the expansion in the Marcellus very briefly. Is this any surprise around what you paid? Secondly, if you intend to continue adding acreage, you've highlighted in the past that you are relatively underweight U.S. gas as an advantage. Are you changing that view? And thirdly, if you could briefly comment on whether or not you're interested in unconventional oil in other parts of the U.S. such as the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, and I'll leave it there.\nGeorge Kirkland: A lot of good questions. I'm going to ask Jeanette to help me or Pat if I don't answer them all. And so I may get a little bit of prompting there. We're trying to put together in the Marcellus a nice-sized portfolio, and we've done a couple of steps on that. I think we're very close to putting together what we want in the Marcellus. There will be additional additions, small additions there where it makes sense synergistically between one acreage we hold in these two and is there something in between. So we'll do that, but I think we have pretty well put together our Marcellus position. My goal is to be able to really lay out what all we have done in the Marcellus and give everyone a really good update in March next year. I think by that period of time, we will have all the pieces pretty well put into place. We'll have our integration well in hand, both integrating Atlas and the Chief piece. So I think at that point, we really will be able to give everyone a full overview of what we see, where we stand, how it all fits together. But I really don't feel comfortable in doing that until probably March. March should be the right time for us.\nPaul Sankey: Understood. Is there a price on the incremental 220s then?\nGeorge Kirkland: At this point in time, I'm not going to share that. What we will do -- what I am committed to do is we'll provide you a lot more price information when we bring all the pieces together.\nPatricia Yarrington: And the other question is unconventional.\nGeorge Kirkland: Unconventional. From a technical point of view, I do like the -- and I've always said I like what we call light shale oil. We like it. I will tell you at this point in time we've seen the pricing of the acreage to be well, frankly, just to be high and impacts the economic viability of buying it. We have done lots of technical work looking for other opportunities around the world that are similar. We're always trying to take knowledge gained in one cloaked location and find similar opportunities around the world. I really don't have any I want to point to at this point. But we are doing work on there. And, Paul, like everything else, it always gets back. We don't just want barrels or MCFs. We want those barrels that deliver strong earnings, strong returns. And if it's inorganic and it's producing, we find it very difficult in most cases to go ante up that money. Our strategy continues to be looking for early entry, looking for exploration opportunities. We think the value, the major value we create is getting it early, using our expertise and from a geotechnical side, from the reservoir engineering side and the project side to create value and then, of course, operate it well. We think that's the way we really create the value for the shareholder.\nPaul Sankey: So you're telling me it's very unlikely you'll make a major acquisition.\nGeorge Kirkland: That's correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: I have a few questions. One of the bigger-look question. I know relative to peers, Chevron has a significant investment for future production growth that does not yet contribute to your earnings as would be expected. But can you share with me maybe the amount of your current employed that is not yet generating income or impacting the numerator in your ROCE calculation?\nPatricia Yarrington: I'd say, I mean a good place to be would be somewhere between 25% and 30% would be a good benchmark for you at this point in time.\nEvan Calio: Okay. And that's clearly, high over time, if you had a time sequence, that's really a higher percentage. Is that fair?\nPatricia Yarrington: Certainly, as we move into the 30% range it is. But I would say, typically, if I look over the last 5 to 7 years or so, that 25% to 30% -- low 30% range is typically the bandwidth that we have operated within.\nEvan Calio: Okay. And a second question for George and maybe more pointed than Paul's. I mean, clearly, excitement's been building on the Utica shale opportunity. And then something that's a bit of a focus this morning with Chesapeake's release and conference call. I know and I believe Chevron has 600,000 acres that you disclosed that has Utica oil shale exposure. But you didn't call that out in Slide 17. Maybe you could discuss how you're thinking about activity there and play potential into 2012?\nGeorge Kirkland: Okay. Well, let me first say we believe it's a little bit too soon to conclude on the potential of the Utica. We've got a good acreage position in the Utica from the Atlas acquisition. We're going to do what we do everywhere in the world. We're going to evaluate that. And the only the way we can evaluate it is we're going to have to drill some wells and test performance. So it's something for the future, but it's, like you say, too early at this point in time to, I think, hype it.\nEvan Calio: But it was -- is it a partial driver in your Atlas acquisition, which is largely perceived as a Marcellus gas acquisition?\nGeorge Kirkland: It was not a major driver in that. It was too unproven at that time to establish a lot of the value.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDouglas Leggate: George, if I may take advantage of you being on the phone with a couple of questions, and I have a follow-up for Pat very quickly. Can you give us an update just generally as to how you see the latest permitting situation in the Gulf of Mexico. And just bolting on to maybe a general update as to when you would expect to really be able to ramp up your activity there. That's my first. I've got a couple of follow-ups, if I may.\nGeorge Kirkland: Okay. I'll try to give you a little bit more than we gave in the comments. To start off, all 3 of our Deepwater rigs are currently working. We're on Moccasin, which is a nice exploration well, and we're on in Buckskin. We're on Tahiti. Tahiti we are about to get into the development drilling stage there. We've drilled a couple of injection wells, all of which was needed for our second phase development of Tahiti. On the permits themselves, so we've got permits for those, for drilling at those locations. Near-term drilling program will require approval for us of about 10 development and exploration plans and 15 drilling permits. So that's what we're in the process of pursuing. We have received the permit for Coronado, which is our next exploration well. And we have also received an approved revised exploration plan for Oceanographer, as well as for our initial development drilling operations at Jack/St. Malo. And we're continuing to progress approvals for Big Foot development drilling. We've got a lot of applications for permit to drill have been submitted, so at this point in time we seem to be able to move things in there through the permit process to allow us to progress our projects and our exploration plans.\nDouglas Leggate: When do you expect [indiscernible] ?\nGeorge Kirkland: In recognition of that, I'll even give you a little -- we have 2 additional Deepwater rigs expected to arrive later this year. The Deepwater Discovery India and the Pacific Santa Ana. And these 2 rigs really are focused on drilling initial development wells for our major capital projects at Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot. And that will allow us to really start. Maybe a little bit of catch up on what time we lost because we lost over a year in time. So we're trying to -- and you can't recapture time, but we're trying to put ourselves in a position to make sure those projects come on, and we have the developable wells to produce into them as they move into production stage.\nDouglas Leggate: Broadly, would you say things are getting -- easier is not the word I'm looking for, but less onerous perhaps in terms of the actual permit? Do you think it's BOEMR is  actually starting to move things through a little quicker? Any perspective would be appreciated.\nGeorge Kirkland: I think the biggest contributor to the improvement in getting permits is really I think people are now better understanding what is required. The requirements to get a permit, the technical requirements, what must be done to make progress to the point of getting the permit is much better determined and understood, and that's big. Once you know what you've got to do, then you can attack it and you can deliver once again a document that meets the needs.\nDouglas Leggate: Jumping around the world to this very quickly to Liberia. Can you give us an update as to -- just remind us what you're working interest is there, when you would expect to really start the activity to pick up and just a general kind of update of your expectations.\nGeorge Kirkland: My memory is working interest is in 80% level for us on 3 large blocks there. I' going to ask somebody to double check that for me as I go on. We're very pleased with that. We see this is the Cretaceous trend that we've seen in West Africa. It's been very successful in Ghana. We're moving forward with our first well to be drilled, to be spudded. And my expectation is it'll be in the fourth quarter. But we are on schedule for that. We've lined up a rig. So we're in, I think, good stead to drill the first well or start drilling the first well this year. Pleased with that. We see, from a geological point of view, we see a large number of prospects. But once again, remember, this is exploration. It's a long ways from any well that's in close proximity where we'll be drilling. So a significant distance, but it looks good at this point from the seismic point. So we'll know a lot more after we drill the first well.\nDouglas Leggate: Last one for me is I guess a follow-up to Paul's question. California fairly modest, I guess, overall position the context of Chevron's scale. But my recollection was that you had sold a lot of your Deep rights about 10 years ago to Occidental. Can you confirm if that was the case on and how much running room have you actually have in the deeper Santos Monterey area?\nGeorge Kirkland: In the Santos area, we do not have a lot of acreage. I don't have that number right in front of me, but that is not where our position is. We'll have to get that as a follow-up either, I guess, next quarter or between our IR folks. I don't have that number right with me, but we are not positioned large there. I just got some help on that, in Liberia, we're 70%. We have a 70% working interest, just to correct that.\nDouglas Leggate: My very quick follow-up was for Pat. Pat, your net cash position, your share buybacks are still very modest. Just some context as to why you're not yet just, choosing to get a little more aggressive, and I'll leave it at that.\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes, Doug, our belief here is, and I think we said this when we reinstated the share repurchase program, we deliberately put flexibility on it in terms of time and in terms of dollars. And we want to be able to sustain the share repurchase program over a long period of time and be able to live through any sort of uncertainties. So our approach is perhaps a little bit more modest than you might think, but our objective there is to be able to have something that we can sustain over time. I think you would agree with us here that there's a fair amount of uncertainty out there. Certainly, what we saw in terms of the U.S. GDP this morning, China GDP has been dampening a little bit, still very strong but dampening a little bit. We've clearly got uncertainty in terms of the U.S. policy environment. And all we are trying to acknowledge is that there can be -- while we're favorably inclined about prices over the medium term and long term, there can be excursions south of that for short periods of time. And we just want to be able to, once we go into the share repurchase program, keep it on track and sustained. So that really is our philosophy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.\nJason Gammel: George, I had a question about the margin -- Upstream margin and strong capture rate you're getting there. I know that part of the contribution to your move into the #1 position was from a lot of the new projects that have been brought online over the last couple of years. And so my question is are you expecting to move past cost recovery mode in any of these projects that are in PSCs that maybe would ratchet down the margin capture? Or then conversely, would you expect the margin capture to actually continue moving forward?\nGeorge Kirkland: Jason, it's a good question. It's got an awful lot of moving parts. Let me start there. Yes, we are moving on some cases on the PSCs to the point where we have much of the capture of the initial investments. It's complicated by recognizing that in many cases, as we move to that point, we also move into later phases like in Agbami 2. We moved into a second phase of development, which continues some of that capture. So you have those and recognize we also have new projects coming on. An example and actually in the same area of the world, Usan will come on next year in Deepwater Nigeria. So we've got another one that way. So these ins and outs, I would tell you that the quality of the new assets coming on, they're very strong in their earnings power. They have very strong earnings per barrel. What I can't tell you is I really don't have -- it's hard for me to get a view of my competitors and what's happening in their portfolio, and I wish I could get a better handle on that myself, which I'm sure all of -- as a matter of fact, maybe that's a question,  as I see some of you, you'll help me on that.\nJason Gammel: Maybe if I could shift to the exploration program in Australia. Unlike some of the other operators in the area, you've really kind of kept the drill bit in front of the marketing activity. And I know that your view has been that you have more than enough gas for the 5 trains that are either sanctioned at Gorgon or about to be sanctioned at Wheatstone. If you think about the resource base, what do you actually think you could underpin now in terms of numbers of trains, that 5 million tons per annum? And in a blue sky case, do you think you'd be able to do a train a year for 10 years?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, let me start. We've got 3 trains at Gorgon. To get everybody oriented, we've got 3 trains at Gorgon that are a little over 15 million tons. We have almost 9 million tons, 8.9 million tons in the 2 trains at Wheatstone. On the case of Gorgon, my confidence of having resource for the fourth train is high. We still, I think, and we are drilling lots of exploration wells. I think we've got to continue that to have the confidence in additional trains. Barrow Island, we will not be able to put anything on beyond 5 trains, and 5 trains is, like I say, is that's all that's going to fit there. We have a lot more space in the case of the Ashburton North side. Wheatstone can probably handle 6 trains. Confidence level is good in the 2 trains that we're moving close to FID, and we have discoveries in the 205 block there, and that's the Clio-1, 2, 3 discoveries and Acme. And now we're doing Acme follow-ups. So we're trying to prove up a quantity of gas there that would give us a lot of confidence in a third train. Remember, the other one unique thing that we're trying to do and I think are doing and you can see it through our participation in the first 2 trains for the Apache, KUFPEC. We're trying to build a hub there that will allow other third parties to bring in gas and to do it in an economical manner. So we're always trying to provide that opportunity set also. And I think that gives us confidence that, that combination of our drilling plus the more open access will allow for additional trains to be built at Wheatstone, the Antelope site.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng: I have 2 questions for George and one really quick follow-up for Pat. George, I suppose that when you initially invest in Atlas Energy as partners, you see it as a great resource base partly maybe is that using it as a beachhead to learn about the shale gas technology and how to operate there. But shale gas and the shale oil that they are quite different from one play to another. So do you think that the position data that already allowed you to have sufficient amount of learning experience to fully understand and expand that knowledge base to the rest of your global portfolio or that you may need beachhead in other play?\nGeorge Kirkland: Okay. Let me -- having access to Atlas for us is very important. It's the process of actually doing makes a lot of difference. We see challenges in the way monies are spent presently in the unconventional gas. One that are -- the first one is we don't believe it takes as many frac stages. You don't have to frac as much of that formation if you truly understand the sweeter spots, if you will, of that formation. So the only way I think we can prove that and really grow that expertise and become better and more economically doing it, is by doing it. So we're trying to do that, of course, and then what we want to do is to be able to apply that technology, that technical ability to other places in the world. We see that as particularly important for us as we move into eastern Europe because we don't see the infrastructure capability by service providers to be nearly as available as what we see in the U.S. So that's how we tie the 2 of those together. So we want to get technically a whole lot smarter, and we want to use what we learn there and be able to apply it around the world.\nPaul Cheng: Sure. I fully understand. But, George, my question is that given that this formation is somewhat different from what we understand. So having a substantial position in Marcellus, is that what you believe already give you sufficient of the learning curve or that you need exposure to other areas? That's my question.\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, I think the case of Marcellus, the Marcellus was the quality of the Marcellus that took us there and the proximity to market. We had the opportunity on scale, relatively early entry, quality. All of that took us there, at this point in time. Europe is, once again, a combination of that with a lot less geotechnical information being known. We've got to drill some wells. We've done G&G. We will be drilling our first well or first wells in Poland this year, and we'll start answering the questions. Drill the well, get more technical information. We'll eventually have to be frac-ing wells. We've got to go through that, Paul, and that's what's going to answer the question. We're willing to get scale in Europe initially, where if it works, you've got the scale to make up a really nice business. And remember, the entry cost in Europe was much different than what the bets are in the United States.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. All right. The second quick one is that for George is Bulgaria. I presume that you just acquired the acres so you're going to do seismic this year, and we should not expect a first well until late 2012.\nGeorge Kirkland: I don't expect -- I'm not even sure we're going to get the seismic started this year. I really am looking more at the seismic next year. And this is so recent, I think, it's a little early to even talk about when the first well. But we'll have more on that in the oncoming quarters.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. And then a quick one for Pat. In the past, I think from your accounting standpoint, Chevron, the Gulf of Mexico oil realization is based on a 1-month lag. I just want to -- curious if that's still the case here.\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes, I mean, I think if I understood that correctly you're asking about the pricing lag out of Mexico, Gulf of Mexico?\nPaul Cheng: That's correct.\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes, that's correct.\nPaul Cheng: You are still on the 1-month lag.\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kate Minyard with JPMorgan.\nKatherine Lucas Minyard: Just a quick question on your buyback program. I realized you talk a little bit about it earlier. But when you're looking at buybacks versus dividends and the redeployment of excess cash or that return to shareholders, it looks like your average diluted share count hasn't really declined over the last several quarters despite the buyback program. So I was curious as to what factors you're weighing given that you want the buyback program to be sustainable as well as you look at distributing that cash through buybacks versus through dividends.\nPatricia Yarrington: That's a good question, Kate. You're right. There hasn't been as much of a reduction in the outstanding shares. And that's simply been a function of the exercises of some stock options by annuitants in their 10-year window. And we've taken a look at that, and it's been obviously driven by how well our share price is done, particularly in the first quarter and second quarter here. When we peg our share repurchase program, we don't really have knowledge to take that other effect into account. So when we talk about our share repurchase program, we really are talking about the amount that we have control over. And therefore, the $1 billion or now upping it at $1.25 billion in the quarter here. And in terms of the dividend play versus the share repurchase play, I think I've been on record many times now in talking about our financial priorities, and the first one really is to sustain and grow the dividend. And we did show a dividend increase here in the second quarter of 8%. So that's the primary distribution to shareholders that we pursue. Share repurchases are a much more discretionary piece, and we peg that to what we consider the short-term, medium-term and longer-term outlook of cash generation -- surplus cash generation for the company.\nKatherine Lucas Minyard: Okay, sure. And then if I could just quickly ask on the PNZ. It looks like production's kind of come down over the last say, 2, 2.5 years. Just curious as to whether that's entitlement related or if it's decline, and then whether the outlook would be that we'd look for an increase as the flooding program kind of gets more underway.\nGeorge Kirkland: The PNZ is that the concession there is a tax and royalty. So it's not a PSC, so there's no effect -- price effect there, and it has declined. Existing deals are on a decline, not a lot but a little bit of decline. The upside the future is really about the steam flood where we see opportunities that could be on a gross basis. We could end up with a production gain there on new production up to 500,000 barrels a day. It's a big opportunity there. We have just for those maybe a little bit of information. We just recompleted into the second Eocene -- or the first Eocene V zone recently and should start our steam flood test there on that second zone in the first Eocene.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Iain Reid with Jefferies.\nIain Reid: Got 3 questions. One for Pat and a couple for George. Pat, just looking at your slides on the Downstream. For international you talk about this timing effect, which I assume is the inventory effect, a positive 155. Just curious as to why there wasn't a similar one for U.S. Downstream, given the fact that all prices increased so much and therefore, there must have been some gains in your Downstream inventory.\nPatricia Yarrington: Right. Actually Iain, that large bar that you see there on international earnings called timing effects, this time is largely a variance between different positions and open paper between the quarters, mark-to-market effects between the quarters. It's not really as inventory driven as it is mark-to-market driven.\nIain Reid: Okay. Can you possibly say then what the overall inventory effect was in the Downstream? Just kind of roughly, if you don't have a kind of exact number.\nPatricia Yarrington: No, I mean, I think that it's not a place we want to go. We don't have a number that's handy like that, and I hate to speculate.\nIain Reid: Okay. All right. George, two for you. Can I come back on Ed's question about costs in Australia? I understand you've got a fair amount of Gorgon contracted, so that probably gives a reasonable amount of comfort in terms of the cost there. But I'm just wondering about Wheatstone. Yes, coming out to FID and I presume [indiscernible] for equipment, turbines, et cetera. Just in terms of cost differential between those 2 projects, since obviously, you're going to use some pretty similar equipment and obviously, probably, pretty much the same labor force.\nGeorge Kirkland: You're absolutely right, Iain. We do have good cost test data. A matter of fact, we're in hand in many cases with contracts, as we approach FID, that we will be able to issue and execute. So we have a pretty good handle on that. That's very typical of our projects when we get to FID. We really have an awful lot of both the purchased equipment and many contracts where we have a pricing-- we have -- beyond a pricing view, we have a contract that we can execute. We have boiled those into our plans for the FID and our request for funds. I can't give you a number at this point in time until we get post-FID. We'll be able to give some of that information. Our expectation is in the fourth quarter that we will be at FID. So that probably sets us up a good timing to do that in the March analyst meeting.\nIain Reid: But is it fair to say -- I presume you're seeing some reasonable inflation through from the awards you did on Gorgon a couple of years ago to what you're seeing in Wheatstone now without giving a number.\nGeorge Kirkland: I would just tell you, we feel we have a very good handle on the pricing. We still believe we are getting some good pricing due to the way we have contracted elements of the project. I really can't go any further than that at this time.\nIain Reid: All right. Sorry, I'm not trying extract anything from you. It's about Tengiz. I just got a question about the future growth projects. I think when we were over there you were talking about being in a position to launch FEED. I'm just -- and the government was kind of sitting on it for some reason. I'm just kind of wondering where you are now, or whether you managed to move that one forward at all and what that means in terms of the timing of the project.\nGeorge Kirkland: I think we are moving forward on it. I still believe that we're on schedule to -- for at least the fourth quarter FEED appropriation to be approved. I think most of our issues, we've covered. And I'm sure hopeful that we're going to make that target date. But we aren't there yet, I'll tell you that. So we're making progress, but we're not there yet.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay. At this point, I'd like to wrap it up. I'd like to say that I appreciate everyone's participation on the call today and everyone's interest in Chevron. I especially want to thank the analysts who asked some very good questions. I'm sure they helped everybody's understanding of the company. So thank you very much, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2011, "date": "2011-04-29 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer from Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia Yarrington: Thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call And Webcast. On the call with me today are Gary Luquette, President of our North American Exploration and Production Company. I've asked Gary to join me on the call this morning to give you an update on our recent Atlas acquisition and Gulf of Mexico activity. Chevron, and Gary specifically, have taken a leadership role in addressing the administration's concerns regarding drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Gary serves as chair of the governing body leading the joint industry task forces that have been working to improve prevention, intervention and spill response capabilities with the goal of getting the industry back to work. Also on the call is Jeanette Ourada, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2011, we'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown here on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter earnings were $6.2 billion or $3.09 per diluted share. Comparing the first quarter 2011 to the same quarter a year earlier, our earnings were up 36%. Upstream benefited from higher crude prices, and Downstream benefited from improved margins. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was over 18%. Our debt ratio at the end of March was 9.5%. In the first quarter, we repurchased $750 million of our shares. In the second quarter, we are increasing our repurchase rate to $1 billion. Finally, we announced Wednesday that Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.06 per share or 8.3% increase in the common stock quarterly dividend. This is our 24th consecutive year of higher dividend payout. Now on Slide 4, cash generated from operations was nearly $10 billion during the first quarter. This is a record for the company. Our cash from operations provided excellent support for our capital program, the Atlas acquisition including associated debt retirement, our dividend payments and our share buyback program. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled nearly $17 billion. This put us in a net cash position of $5.3 billion. We see the 8% dividend increase and a simultaneous boost in our share repurchase rate as meaningful moves. Combined, we believe they send strong signals about our ability to both generate and to deliver tangible cash distribution rewards to our shareholders. Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons. Jeanette?\nJeanette Ourada: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 5. I'll compare results of the first quarter 2011 with the fourth quarter 2010. As a reminder, our earnings release compares first quarter 2011 with the same quarter a year ago. First quarter earnings were $960 million higher than the fourth quarter. Starting on the left side of the chart, Upstream earnings were up $1.1 billion driven by higher crude oil realizations. Downstream results were lower by $120 million. Stronger refining and chemical margins were more than offset by unfavorable timing impacts in this quarter and the absence of fourth quarter gains on asset sales. The variance in the other bar reflects the unfavorable swing in corporate tax items. On Slide 6, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the first quarter were $519 million higher than the fourth quarter's results. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $390 million. U.S. crude realizations were up 17% between consecutive quarters, higher than the 11% increase in the average spot price of West Texas intermediate. Our U.S. crude realizations are primarily tied to Mars, Louisiana light sweet and San Joaquin Valley heavy crudes, which all traded at premiums to WTI during the first quarter. Natural gas realizations improved by 11%, in line with Henry Hub spot prices. Lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $40 million between periods due to two fewer days in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Lower operating expenses benefited earnings by $40 million between periods, primarily due to lower costs related to timing of maintenance activities. The other bar is comprised of a number of unrelated items, including the absence of unfavorable year-end LIFO inventory drawdowns and lower exploration and abandonment expenses. Turning to Slide 7. International Upstream earnings were up $611 million compared with the fourth quarter. Higher oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $910 million. Average liquids realizations increased 20%, in line with the increase in average Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations rose 5% between quarters. Lower liftings, primarily in Angola, Australia and Kazakhstan, decreased earnings by $255 million. This is directionally aligned with two fewer days in the quarter. Lower exploration expense benefited earnings by $140 million due to lower well write-offs and lower data acquisition costs. Moving to the next bar. An unfavorable change in foreign currency effects impacted earnings by $65 million. The first quarter had a loss of about $115 million compared to a loss of about $50 million in the fourth quarter. These foreign exchange effects have no direct impact on cash. They are primarily balance sheet translation effects. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including higher withholding taxes on affiliate dividend distributions, partly offset by a lower depreciation expense. Turning to Slide 8. During our March Security Analyst Meeting, we discussed our plan to move certain major capital projects that have reached peak production into our base business. The map shows the specific projects being recategorized. The two bars on the graph show fourth quarter production with both the original split between base business and MCPs and the new categorization. The impact was a shift of 482,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 26,000 barrels per day in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts during the first quarter, decreasing production about 22,000 barrels per day. In the past, we have used the change in WTI to calculate a PSC price effect. Given the recent divergence in the WTI-Brent Spread, going forward, we will use the change in Brent to calculate the price effect because it is more closely tied to our international realizations. The average Brent price increased $19 per barrel between quarters, which resulted in about a 1,200 barrel per day volume reduction for each dollar increase in Brent. Recall that over a range of prices, PSC effects are not linear. As prices rise, the PSC production impact decreases. Weather conditions in onshore U.S., Australia and the U.K. lowered production 15,000 barrels per day between quarters. Base business production increased 7,000 barrels per day, largely driven by an increase in cost recovery barrels in various locations, offset by normal field decline. This bar also includes a small positive impact from the addition of 6 weeks of Atlas production. Contributions for major capital projects increased first quarter production by 4,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by continued ramp up at Perdido and Frade. We reaffirm our full year production outlook of 2.79 million barrels per day. The outlook assumes $79 per barrel, the same average price as 2010 and does not assume OPEC curtailments, material security or market impacts. We'll provide another update on the second quarter earnings call. Turning to Slide 10. U.S. Downstream earnings fell $33 million in the first quarter. Indicator margins improved earnings by $170 million, driven by higher refining margins for both the Gulf Coast and West Coast. Both areas had stronger demand especially for distillates. This stronger demand occurred simultaneously with normal planned refinery maintenance. Stocks were depleted and margins widened as a consequence of these two divergent forces. The next bar shows a $380 million negative earnings variance, primarily reflecting the absence of a fourth quarter gain on the sale of our interest in the Colonial Pipeline Co. Chemical earnings improved by $90 million mainly due to higher margins for olefins and aromatics. The other bar includes positive impacts from lower turnaround activity in the first quarter and a favorable pipeline rate settlement. On Slide 11, international Downstream earnings were also lower, falling $87 million from fourth quarter's results. Margins reduced earnings by $25 million. Stronger refining margins in Asia and Canada were more than offset by supply mix effects in Asia and lower European refining margins. Timing effects represented a $230 million negative earnings variance between quarters, reflecting a swing from a positive $35 million in the fourth quarter to a negative $195 million in the first quarter. The primary drivers were unfavorable inventory effects, mostly in Asia during the period of rapidly rising prices and the absence of fourth quarter's favorable year-end LIFO effects. Lower operating expenses across multiple categories benefited earnings by $35 million. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items, including small asset sales, improved shipping results and a favorable tax variance partly offset by lower volumes. Slide 12 covers all other. First quarter net charges were $388 million compared to a net $294 million charge in the fourth quarter. The $94 million increase between quarters is primarily due to unfavorable variance in corporate tax items. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. Now I'd like to turn it over to Gary for an update on North America.\nGary Luquette: Thanks, Jeanette, and good morning. It's good to be here with you. I'd like to give you a brief overview of my area of responsibility, Chevron's North America Upstream operations, and then discuss recent progress in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlas acquisition. Turning to Slide 14. North America has a tremendous natural resource base and they are close to fully developed infrastructure serving large markets, making it an attractive place to do business. We operate a solid mix of base business assets and major capital projects. Our portfolio includes both conventional oil and natural gas and unconventional energy sources such as oil sands, coalbed methane and shale gas, and we continue to grow our portfolio. Our U.S. operations are anchored by assets in the Gulf of Mexico, California, Texas and the Rocky Mountains. In Canada, our activities reached throughout Atlantic Canada, the Arctic and the Western oil sands. In total, our North American operations account for about 1/4 of Chevron's production. During the rest of our time together this morning, I want to focus on the Gulf of Mexico and our recent Atlas acquisition. Let's start with the Gulf of Mexico. Slide 15. With more than 60 years of experience operating in the Gulf, we've proven that we can explore for and produce oil and gas both safely and in an environmentally sound manner. We produced 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent as we have progressed development from the shelf into the Deepwater. We maintain a significant presence throughout the Gulf of Mexico. We are a leading leaseholder across both the shelf and the Deepwater. In 2010, we averaged 260,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent, making us one of the largest producers in the region. On Slide 16. Our Gulf of Mexico portfolio has a wide variety of assets and projects. These include offshore platforms in shallow and deep water, onshore operations, gas plants, water floods and subsea wells. We drill in deep and shallow water and operate in high-pressure, high-temperature environments. We have added acreage through recent lease sales, which allow us to pursue promising ultra-deep gas opportunities in the shallow waters of the shelf. Despite the challenging regulatory environment, Chevron remains very bullish on the Gulf of Mexico. Let me tell you about some recent developments. Turning to Slide 17. In 2010, our plans were to drill 4 exploration impact wells: Moccasin, Coronado, Oceanographer and the Buckskin appraisal. These wells were delayed by the drilling moratorium. We are ready to get back to work, and these wells are our top priority. We will be able to do so once the new permit requirements are fully understood and permit applications are revised and submitted. We'll also need for the regulators to establish an efficient method for reviewing and approving what is expected to be a backlog of permit applications. In late March, we received the permit for our Moccasin exploration prospect. This was the first such exploration permit granted to any operator after the moratorium was lifted. The rig arrived on site two days after receipt of the permit, and we'll soon be drilling. The Buckskin permit application was submitted on April 18. We're expecting an approval in the next week or two. We have also received a permit for our second water injection well at the Tahiti 2 project, and drilling is underway. Chevron currently has 3 deepwater drillships in the Gulf. Two have returned to work and the third is awaiting a permit for our Buckskin appraisal well. The good news is that we see activity slowly beginning to ramp up, but it's still too early to know what the new normal for pace of permitting and overall activity levels will be. We're hopeful the administration shares our goal of expedited permitting now that we've established higher performance standards, so we can move forward in developing our domestic energy supplies. Our near-term deepwater drilling program will require the approval of approximately 10 development and exploration plans, and approximately 15 drilling permit applications for both development and exploration wells. These are in various stages of preparation for submittal. We plan to begin drilling development wells at Jack/St. Malo in the second half of this year. This was always the plan. And to date, start-up remains on track. Should permitting delays persist further into the year, the number of wells available at start up could be impacted, but we remain committed to previously communicated first oil dates. I'd now like to provide an update on Atlas. Turning to Slide 18. We're very pleased with the Atlas acquisition, which closed in mid-February. These assets are in one of the sweet spots in the Marcellus Shale, one of the key shale gas plays in North America. With the drilling carry provided by our Marcellus joint venture partner, Chevron's near-term investment is limited. Over the next several years, the joint venture partner will fund 75% of our drilling costs, up to a total of $1.4 billion. Equally important, the acquisition has provided us with a highly skilled workforce with strong operating experience and established land management capabilities. They are strong organizational synergies with Chevron's existing technical expertise and our global experience with large-scale developments. We have created a new business unit to manage our acquired assets. We are making good progress on integration and expect transition activities will continue throughout the year. Early activities are focused on capturing operational synergies on capital project management and execution and smoothly integrating our financial and IT systems. We have a very active year planned. There are currently 9 rigs operating in the Marcellus, and we expect to drill a total of 70 wells this year. We expect 2011 production for both the Marcellus and Antrim shales to average about 115 million cubic feet of gas per day. Our pace is measured. We are optimizing our development well programs to lower our costs, improve well performance and shrink the time from well completion to hook up and production. This is a long-term play for us. We're in a great position as we ramp up for a multiyear drilling program. It's a great marriage between Atlas' commitment to the resource and Chevron's strong subsurface expertise and capital project discipline. Admittedly, it's very early, but all signs are positive. And we expect to capture the value we identified in our initial evaluation. Finally, the state of Pennsylvania has asked all Marcellus operators to cease delivering produced water associated with shale gas extraction to publicly owned water treatment facilities by May 19. It was always Atlas' and Chevron's plans to discontinue disposal of surplus-produced water into these facilities by the end of the year 2011. With this recent request, we will accelerate our plan and comply with the May 19 date. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Pat.\nPatricia Yarrington: Thanks, Gary. We're now on Slide 19. I'd like to wrap up with a few comments on Chevron's strategic progress during the first quarter of the year. We've stayed the course with strong safety performance after achieving our safest year ever in 2010. In the Downstream, we continued to progress our portfolio rationalization efforts announcing the sale of the Pembroke Refinery and associated marketing assets in the U.K. and Ireland. We completed the sale of our Downstream businesses in the eastern Caribbean and in certain countries in Africa. We have also announced an agreement to sell our Downstream businesses in Spain. Additionally in Downstream, we reached a final investment decision on the construction of a $1.4 billion lubricants manufacturing facility that will be located at our Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery. This project leverages a strong refinery and proprietary Chevron technology to meet the growing demand for higher-margin premium lubricant. We had a number of accomplishments in the Upstream. As Gary discussed we completed the Atlas transaction. We were awarded 1.5 million acres in Romania, further bolstering our global shale gas portfolio. We continued our exploration success in Western Australia with the Orthrus-2 natural gas discovery, and we announced 2 new oil discoveries in the Moho-Bilondo area offshore Republic of Congo. In addition, we signed a Sales and Purchase Agreement with Kyushu Electric for the delivery of LNG from the Gorgon Project. I'll close by mentioning that our Upstream operations are just under $25 per barrel for the quarter. Based on preliminary competitor results announced to date, we outpaced our nearest competitor by nearly $5. We've led our peer group on this metric now for 7 consecutive quarters. We're definitely off to a great start in the first quarter of the year, both financially and operationally. Now that concludes our prepared remarks. We welcome your questions at this point. So, Sean, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.\nDoug Terreson: In International Downstream and specifically the unfavorable variances in that area, I want to see if you will elaborate a little bit further on the supply mix effect, and I think Jeanette attributed to Asia in the period. That is, what were they, what products do they involve, et cetera. Just some color, if you could.\nPatricia Yarrington: Well, Doug, it's really across multiple different products. And what really happened is there was very rapidly increasing prices in the quarter so at the end of the quarter as we revalued our inventories, you see the big negative effect there. Of that bar, $170 million is related to inventories, so that is the key driver of that bar.\nDoug Terreson: Okay, and also in E&P, and specifically, on global natural gas, there seems to be progress on block A in Cambodia and even more on block B in Vietnam. So I want to see, if we could get an update on those projects, and also on Venezuelan gas, that is, if there's anything to update on Venezuelan gas.\nPatricia Yarrington: Let me start with Vietnam. So Vietnam, we commenced front-end engineering and design in the first quarter of 2010, and we do expect FID decision later this year. So that project is moving forward. Cambodia, we're still assessing the Cambodia opportunity, and we haven't laid out any near-term milestones for Cambodia. I'm sorry, your last question?\nDoug Terreson: Yes. Venezualan gas, is there anything new to report there?\nPatricia Yarrington: No.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng: Gary, two questions, one in Atlas. What's the growth rate you guys are targeting or expecting for the next two to three years, given you have your partner carry your cost? And then, what kind of expected return that you have in mind on that? The second question is that you do you have some reasonable land position in the Permian Basin? Is there any -- what type of opportunity you have in terms of the nonconventional shale oil in your land position? Also that, you guys have some of your competitors start to be more aggressive trying to get into early into the new shale oil play either both in Canada or as well as in the U.S. but does not seems like that, Chevron is not more -- is as aggressive or would that maybe, making as much noise as some of your competitors. Wondering there if there's any insight that you can share here.\nGary Luquette: Okay. Thanks for the questions Paul, there's a lot there. So let me see if I can unpack these one at a time starting with Atlas. It's way too early for us to forecast growth rates. We are just a couple of months now into taking ownership of those assets. As I mentioned in my remarks, our focus early on is going to be in trying to build a very efficient execution process that's going to allow us to start earning acreage, and so we'll have to let that unfold a little bit longer before we can start pinpointing the specific growth objectives for you. With respect to the Permian Basin, we are in a great position there. In fact, just a few weeks ago, we celebrated our 5 billionth barrel production milestone from the Permian basin with Chevron and Chevron legacy companies operating out there, and we have a tremendous amount of opportunities left. So we're investing quite aggressively, not just in the conventional sorts of plays, but also, we're looking at some tight oil. Now this would not be considered shale oil, but certainly ultra-tight oil that we feel will represent a nice opportunity for us to continue to add volume in the Permian Basin. And I think your third question dealt with kind of our views towards Canada and some of the unconventionals. Yes, and I think...\nPaul Cheng: Not just Canada, but also U.S. also, Gary.\nGary Luquette: Okay, well, that's good that you made that clarification, because I think Paul, we typically look across North America with the same sort of scrutiny. We look through the same lenses, and we are watching what is unfolding. We're evaluating opportunities as they come along. Many of these opportunities that present themselves are quite pricey because there were independents that got involved very early on in some of the land acquisition. So we're going to continue to look and evaluate opportunities. But there's nothing in particular that I can report on.\nPaul Cheng: Gary, are you guys looking at more on the already identified existing play? Or that trying to look and venture into some untested play, which the entry costs are much lower?\nGary Luquette: Well, it's a combination, Paul. So as we do our regional analysis to try to understand the geology and the producing mechanisms, we're looking across the board. Some of those lead us very early into possible entry positions, early entry positions and others. People have already acquired the land and we're continuing to look at ways that Chevron can create value in those plays.\nPaul Cheng: Just a final one, a short one. Pat or Jeanette, can you tell us at the end of the first quarter from an inventory standpoint, are you still under lift over lift or neutral?\nPatricia Yarrington: We're slightly under lifted, not too dissimilar from fourth quarter.\nPaul Cheng: Can you remind us then, how much?\nPatricia Yarrington: About 1%, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: 1%?\nPatricia Yarrington: About 1%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.\nEdward Westlake: A question just following on to Gary from the previous question on the Permian. You've talked about some exciting opportunities in the nonconventional and the conventional. Can you just talk about what sort of the general -- will those opportunities be able to offset decline? Will you be able to grow the Permian or maintain it? And the same question with regards to your Californian oil position.\nGary Luquette: As you are aware, those two positions, the Permian and our heavy oil holdings in California are very, very mature assets. Many of these fields, certainly in California, are 100 years old, and in Permian we're talking about north of 50 years old. So I would certainly look at it as a win for Chevron, if we could hold our production levels that we currently have or at least arrest some of the decline that you see in the normal field decline. So I think our objective would be to try to replace declining production with some of these new opportunities and try to hold what we have, which are quite sizable. We're nearly 200,000 barrels a day in California and over 70,000 barrels a day in the Permian Basin, and we want to try to hold that if possible.\nEdward Westlake: And then a follow-on question on the Gulf, the ultra-deep gas in the shallow waters. When do you think you will test that?\nGary Luquette: Well, actually that play is being tested now. Paul (sic) [Ed], there are some smaller players that -- sized companies that have been involved in this for some time and have pretty much proven that the gas is there. And we made a move here a year ago and acquired some additional acreage, and this is on top of acreage that we already hold by production, by producing through some of the shallower zones. So we actually are participating in an exploration well at present with a third party. And we hope to get another exploration well in, in the 2011 campaign.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDouglas Leggate: I am going to try a couple also. Pat, if I could try a couple for you, and then one for Gary to take advantage of him being here. The quick ones from me. You've redefined the base, I guess, as you explained in your prepared remarks. What does that do to actually change the underlying decline rate? Is there any change there in your guidance? And if I may just bolt on my other one, the exploration charges were quite light in the quarter. Is that just a seasonal issue because it was light Q1 last year also? Or did that reflect less dry hole charges or load overall expenditures? And then I've got a follow-up for Gary, please.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay. Doug, thanks. With regard to your first question on the decline rate, we're basically in the 3% to 4% range. There's no change in the guidance that we have given out previously. We just wanted to be very clear about the change in the base. We mentioned it in the March meeting, we just wanted to be very clear this time through. And with regard to the second question?\nJeanette Ourada: Yes, so on exploration, it was lower for both reasons that you mentioned, Doug. There were lower well write-offs in the first quarter, and also lower data acquisition costs.\nDouglas Leggate: Okay. But no real change in the overall trend?\nJeanette Ourada: No. I mean, it can be very lumpy as you know, just given the timing of well write-offs. That really is normally is the rationale behind any quarter-to-quarter variance.\nDouglas Leggate: Okay, thank you. Gary, I appreciate you being on the call this morning. It's really more of a big-picture question. There's been a lot of talk about changes to drilling subsidies and so-called tax benefits for the industry. I just wondered if you could give us your take on the current debate, what Chevron's potential exposure would be. I'm guessing that's not significant. Just the overall perspective that Chevron brings to this. And if you are, in fact, having any discussions with the government over how their consultations with industry. That would be great.\nGary Luquette: To my knowledge, we're not having any specific discussions with the government right now with respect to specifics, sorts of incentives that have been in place. We've taken a general position that certainly when you look at the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Deepwater royalty relief was a huge success for the government, for industry and for the American people. It accomplished what it set out to do, which was to stimulate marginal play, get activity in there, get proof-of-concept going, get investment going, and eventually, get production that drives a tax and royalty revenue to the government. So it's been a huge success. So we've tried to take that message and try to communicate that to everyone that'll listen in the administration that incentives do work. And when it can spur investment, then good things can happen in follow on. But that's just kind of a general position. I don't know if that satisfies what you were looking for whether you'd like something else.\nDouglas Leggate: Well, I'm just curious, so I'm not expecting any numbers. But just an order of materiality, if drilling subsidies and tangible drilling costs and so on were revoked, if you like, you don't, I imagine, have a significant onshore position that would meaningfully impact you. I'm just looking for some confirmation if that it would be material or if it'd be less material, would it change your investment strategy? Would it alter your investment in the base decline onshore U.S. Those kind of issues are really what I'm trying to get to.\nPatricia Yarrington: Right, and I think, Doug, we actually take issue with even using the word subsidy in some of the dialogue that the administration has had, because this really is just deductions that have been allowed for our industry, as well as a whole host of other industry. So it really is not a subsidy at all here. So our dialogue back with the administration really is trying to get clarity around those points. And really when you think about it, particularly, around the IDCs [intangible drilling costs], this is something that's been in play for a long period of time, for a decade. It allows you to have an earlier deduction for a risky business that, for a smaller player in particular, allows them to afford the huge capital outlays that they're putting at risk. And so I think, for smaller companies in particular, this is an enormous issue for companies like that. And really the message we want to get across here on this point is that in order to make more supplies available for the globe and to get energy prices into the more affordable range, what you really want to do is incent production, incent the domestic supplies, not tax them or take away tax deductions that they have currently.\nDouglas Leggate: I'm sorry Pat, would it change your investment policy or not?\nPatricia Yarrington: Well, I think it's a hypothetical. We don't really want to go there. I mean, obviously, we'd have to look at the full economics of what's allowed from a tax code standpoint.\nDouglas Leggate: I understand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.\nMark Gilman: Had a couple for Gary. First, Gary, markets in Coronado, are those Miocene or lower tertiary prospects?\nGary Luquette: Lower tertiary.\nMark Gilman: In both cases?\nGary Luquette: Yes.\nMark Gilman: Okay. Can you update us or comment at all on your planned activity in the Duvernay?\nGary Luquette: We're going to start an exploration appraisal program late this fall, Mark. And we have additional wells planned in 2012. We're going to do some seismic work and use the seismic and well work to start trying to better understand the resource potential in that recent lease acquisition.\nMark Gilman: Okay. And just one more, if I could, regarding Atlas specifically. How does the activity level envisioned for this year compare to that which Atlas had underway previously? And can you give me a rough idea what some of the individual well metrics look like in terms of IPs or EURs, Gary?\nGary Luquette: Okay. Mark, first of all, pretty substantial increase year-on-year in terms of activity levels. But I must say not as high as what Atlas had planned as we have taken control of that operation and started working with the Atlas employee base and the contractor base, I think we felt going a little bit slower early on to try to take a more measured approach towards building the execution efficiency that we want was in order. But we're going to be on the level of about 70 wells this year, which is about 5x what they drilled in 2010. So we're on a very steep curve. It's very early in the processing of that resource base, so we expect to continue to increase our activity levels there but at a very measured pace to make sure that we get it done right, the Chevron way. And on the last question, I think it's just too early for us to start putting a dot on the map with respect to IPs or EURs. It's -- obviously, we have expectations for that resource, but it's still too early for us to really be able to represent that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.\nFaisel Khan: I was wondering if you could help us with the overall picture on North America, Gary. If we're looking at the returns on capital with the onshore unconventional liquids play, and if we're looking kind of deep offshore, I guess what's -- where is the -- where are the relative returns? What's the better place to put that incremental dollar to work, if you had to be forced to put a dollar at one place or another?\nGary Luquette: Well, we have a very diverse portfolio, Faisal, and we're in the business both for short-term returns as well as longer term, positioning ourselves to have good access to resources for the next 10 years and the 10 years after that. So we kind of use a basket, if you will, of performance metrics that we use in allocating our capital programs. So for the -- to pick winners and losers, some represent a lower return, longer life sort of resources. The others represent shorter payout, higher return sorts of opportunities. And what we try to do is balance that across a portfolio of investment opportunities.\nFaisel Khan: Okay. So no, but you can't -- I mean, you can give me kind of relative view which areas are better than others in terms of the different prospects?\nGary Luquette: No, I really can't because we're managing across the North American portfolio, and then, the North American portfolio is then fit into a global Upstream portfolio. So I think it would be just too hard to do that right now.\nFaisel Khan: Okay, got you. And if I'm looking at the 15 permit applications that you guys intend to file, are those going to all come at once or are they going to come kind of over a period of the next 12 to 24 months?\nGary Luquette: So they're going to come over a period of time. But the permit applications that I laid out in my opening remarks are going to come sooner versus later. These are all permits for exploration wells, development wells, delineation wells associated with the program that we have laid out over the next couple of years. So we expect to move those permits as swiftly as we can through our shop and into the government shops so that they can start their process of review and approval.\nFaisel Khan: Okay, great. And then, if I'm looking at the Lower 48 for you guys for your onshore rig activity, both gas and liquids, how many rigs do you guys have deployed between those 2 plays, and how do you think that'll trend throughout the year?\nGary Luquette: Well, I can't answer how many rigs. It's just a detail that I don't have with me this morning, but I can assure you that rig count is higher in 2011 than it was in 2010. We are increasing activity, both onshore and offshore, and so those counts are increasing.\nFaisel Khan: Okay. Great. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Iain Reed with Jefferies.\nIain Reid: I've got a question for Gary and then one for Pat. Gary, on the -- you've been obviously responsible for talking to the regulatory authorities about the Gulf of Mexico drilling. In terms of the increased oversight and the requirements for testing or BOPs, et cetera, how much do you think that's going to add to cost on a kind of average exploration and an average development well in your opinion?\nGary Luquette: Well, we still haven't, I think, got at a run rate and a pace, Iain, that would let me understand what the total revamp system incremental cost might be. I think the cost that we are -- the change that we most are concerned about is the time required to process permits. Clearly, there's going to be incremental costs. We know, for instance, on the recent well designs that we have put in we've had to enhance our casing program. In some cases, running casing all the way back up to the surface, whereas in the past, that was done in a tie-back fashion. So we're seeing incremental costs on the casing program with those wells that could be in the range of 10% of the well cost. But the whole system of inspection, certification, implementing, verifying, certifying, all that is yet to be sussed out. We're going to need more time.\nIain Reid: So have you actually reconsidered drilling certain wells due to this increased requirements that you see now?\nGary Luquette: No, it hasn't changed our view towards individual wells are towards the Gulf of Mexico in a broader sense.\nIain Reid: Okay. Thanks. And one question about Australia. You've had further exploration success in the Carnarvon, and you showed us up the -- on the Strategy Meeting your resource base there. I just wonder how close you are now to starting serious work on the fifth train at Gorgon now.\nPatricia Yarrington: Well, I think it's really premature to have us go down that path. I mean, we did show you materials back in March that suggested we've got additional gas supplies available that would support or underpin a fourth train. But I don't want to get too far out over our skis and thinking beyond that. I will say it is a hugely prolific basin. However, and so if that becomes -- if we have continued exploration success there, then that's something that would certainly would be in our sights. Obviously, brownfield expansions are much more economic than greenfield. And if there is a way to see ourselves to a fifth train, we certainly would like to do that, but we're not at that stage of committing to that at this point.\nIain Reid: Do you think you need more drilling to do that or is it just more interpretation of what you've got?\nPatricia Yarrington: I think there's more drilling and interpretation.\nIain Reid: Okay. And one final question, on your dividend increase, I was a bit confused about whether that applied to this quarter or whether that's a second quarter event.\nPatricia Yarrington: It'll be a second quarter payment.\nGary Luquette: I mean, yes. Undeclared, it has...\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes. So second quarter dividend for the second quarter payment will be at $0.78 a share.\nIain Reid: Okay. So the first quarter dividend is still $0.72?\nPatricia Yarrington: That's correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar.\nAllen Good: I wonder if, Gary, if you could just explain a little bit on the new business unit that was established with Atlas. Is that going to include all of Chevron's pre-existing unconventional resources, and will that wrap in the global portfolio as well?\nGary Luquette: Thanks for the question Allen, and the short answer is no, it will not. Initially, the new business unit is going to be focused on the recent acquisitions. The assets that Atlas had in the portfolio that includes the Marcellus as well as the Antrim production out of Michigan. We want this unit to get focused early on, on those assets to make sure that we have a smooth transition, a smooth integration and we get started on the right foot. We also realize that there is going to be things that we're going to develop and learn from this asset base that's going to be very applicable to some of the shale gas acquisitions, the acreage that we picked up over the course of 2010. So we're going to start working on surrounding this organization with the center of expertise for shale gas that will allow us to leverage those learnings. But at the same time, we want to be very careful that our start in the Marcellus is a good one, a safe one, a reliable one, so that we can build a very sound base there for decades to come.\nAllen Good: Sounds good. I wonder if you could elaborate as well on your water treatment plans? I know that whole situation got lot of press lately, any detrimental impact or supposed detrimental impact from the frac-ing fluid and the other water treatment plants. Just interested in what your plan is there, if you're not going to be able to treat it at the public utilities anymore.\nGary Luquette: Right. Well, eventually we were going to get there any way, Allen, and we were going to do that through adding a second and eventually growing our frac spreads, so that we could drill and complete more wells, that's on the natural plan. And what we're going to do is we're going to accelerate some of that activity, so we'll actually add a frac spread to our operational a little earlier. That will consume much of the surplus water and then the rest of the water that is left over we'll inject in permitted disposal wells.\nAllen Good: Okay, sounds good. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: Just hope to get an update on two of your frontier programs, the Liberian entrance from late last year, and also your plans for Romania from earlier this year.\nJeanette Ourada: Yes, really, we don't have a tremendous amount of update relative to what we said back in March. We have the three licenses that we acquired. We have a 70% interest there. Obviously, it's a significant deepwater -- there have been significant deepwater discoveries in the region, and we're maturing the prospects. We plan to drill a well later this year.\nPavel Molchanov: That's Liberia and on Romania?\nPatricia Yarrington: On Romania, it really is drilling as well. I mean, further evaluation, seismic activity as the year progresses. There's not extensive, more update that I can provide at that point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Herman Ladeuix with CLSA. Hernan Ladeuix - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc. I have a question about the energy projects in Australia. I wonder if you can share any thoughts about the impact of the Australian dollar on the cost of Gorgon and potentially on the plans for Wheatstone?\nPatricia Yarrington: Right. I mean, both projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone, obviously, can be -- could be affected by the foreign exchange impact. But I'd just say both projects, and let me just focus in primarily on Gorgon. It's a global project. We have a lot of activity that's going on in Australia, but there is an awful lot of the procurement activity that is done globally. So we have currency impacts that are Korean, other Asian countries, European, U.S. dollar, et cetera. So it is a multicurrency project, and it's part of the impact that will occur over multiple years. Same thing would be true of a Wheatstone Project. I would just offer though that we have, as we go forward on these projects from an FID standpoint, we have an awful lot of the cost activity that is well-defined and well-scoped, and in many cases, fully committed. So on Gorgon, we committed, reaffirmed back in March that we were on schedule and on cost for the Gorgon Project. On Wheatstone, we intend to go to FID later this year. We have the contracts out for bid at this point in time, and we should have a firm estimate of what that project cost will be at that point in time. Hernan Ladeuix - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc. But, Jeanette, should we still think about the $37 billion on that, I mean, given that the fact that not only the Australian but other currencies have moved cost substantially, at the same the FID?\nJeanette Ourada: Yes, you should still consider to think about the $37 billion. Remember, that's over a 60-month construction period, and the dollar moves up and down, and there's an awful lot of variation that can occur. So we're early days into these. We're only about 20 months or so into the Gorgon Project, so there's a lot of time left as well.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions in the queue at this time.\nJeanette Ourada: All right. I guess that we'll close off here, and let me wrap up and just say, I thank everybody's time and attention here this morning and the participation on the call. I particularly want to ask -- applaud the folks who asked the questions because that helps get more clarification out there. Thank you, everybody. I appreciate your interest in Chevron. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes Chevron's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}], "2013": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2012, "date": "2013-02-01 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay. Thanks, Sean. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Chief Financial Officer and Jeff Gustavson, who is the General Manager of Investor Relations. We will of course refer to slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that the presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the usual cautionary statement that we have on Slide 2. Turning to slide 3, I want to begin where we always do is safety. We continue to achieve world-class low industrial injury and illness rates. We had our lowest ever days away from work rate and once the date is finalized we expect to again lead the industry for the second consecutive year on this measure. We are also focused on process safety, with many successes. Last year we had our fewest number of spills ever, which translated to record low spill volume. We believe this two will be the best in the industry. Having said this, it was not a perfect year. We do believe that zero incidence is attainable. We are not there yet, but we\u2019re striving to learn and improve to get incidence free operations. Our financial performance in 2012 was quite strong. We expect when all the 2012 results were in to again post the highest Upstream earnings per barrel by a significant margin and to be very near the top and Downstream earnings per barrel as well. These excellent financial results validate our strategies and the many past investment decisions. We\u2019d like to summarize just a few additional accomplishments from last year. In our Upstream business we\u2019re steadily progressing our major capital projects, the Gorgon project was over 55% complete at year-end. And Wheatstone has made good progress as well, both from a construction standpoint and in securing of tick commitments through several new long-term LNG supply agreements. We just posted a short video of recent Gorgon construction progress on our webpage, www.chevron.com. I encourage you to take a few minutes to view the video. The progress is quite impressive. We also continued construction activities on our projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico where Big Foot and Jack/St. Malo are both on budget and on schedule for start-up in 2014. We achieved start-up at Usan, and Agbami Phase 2 developments in Nigeria as well as Caesar/Tonga, Tahiti 2 deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico. We continue to expand our discovered resource base with asset acquisitions in the Delaware basin in the U.S. and in Western Canada through an agreement to join the Kitimat LNG project. We also grew our exploration portfolio by acquiring positions in several new areas and including the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Suriname, Sierra Leone, Lithuania and the Ukraine. Our reserve replacement ratio was 112% with ads distributed broadly across Upstream portfolio. In our Downstream business we completed our three year restructuring plan and have delivered on the commitments we made when we first began simplifying our business, streamlining our portfolio. We do see cost and improving returns all while retaining skill where we have competitive positions. We also continue to make progress on key growth projects in our lubricants and chemical businesses. We\u2019re very proud of our performance this past year. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pat, who\u2019ll take you through our financials. Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Hey, thank you, John. Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were $7.2 billion or $3.70 per diluted share. For the year, earnings were an impressive $26.2 billion. This equates to $13.32 per diluted share nearly tied with 2011\u2019s record performance. Return on capital employed for the year approached 19% and our debt ratio at year-end was 8.2%. 2012 marked our 25th consecutive annual dividend increase with an 11.1% rise in the quarterly rate. This demonstrates our confidence in our future performance and is consistent with our priority of rewarding our shareholders with sustained and competitive dividend growth. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares bringing the full year share repurchase total to $5 billion. In the first quarter of 2013, we expect to repurchase the same amount $1.25 billion of shares. Finally, Chevron's 2012 TSR was 5%. We continue to lead our peer group on total shareholder returns for the three-year, the five-year and the ten-year period as well as all periods in between. And you probably noticed we are also off to a strong TSR start so far this year. Turning to slide 5, cash generated from operations was $12.9 billion during the fourth quarter. For the full year, cash from operations was nearly $39 billion reflecting our impressive operating performance and the cash generating strength of our portfolio. At year end, our cash balances totaled $22 billion. This kept us in a net cash position of about $10 billion at year end. Our strong cash flow and solid balance sheet continued to be a competitive advantage. Now on slide 6, I'll compare the results of fourth quarter 2012 with the third quarter of 2012. As a reminder, our earnings release compares fourth quarter 2012 with the same quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter earnings were $7.2 billion, nearly $2 billion higher than third quarter results. Upstream earnings increased $1.7 billion reflecting increased gains on asset transactions and higher liftings. Downstream results were up $236 million between quarters, driven by favorable inventory effects and gains on asset transactions. The variance in the other bar reflects a favorable swing in corporate tax items, partially offset by higher corporate charges. On slide 7, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were $241 million higher than third quarter's results. Higher realizations improved earnings by $40 million, driven largely by a 22% increase in natural gas realizations. Higher production volumes increased earnings by $85 million between periods, reflecting recovery in production, post Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico and increased production associated with recently acquired acreage in the Permian Basin. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including favorable tax impacts and the net effect of small asset transactions. Now on slide 8, international Upstream earnings were about $1.5 billion higher than the third quarter. Higher liftings increased earnings by $295 million. Planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and in the UK in the third quarter were completed and production from these fields returned to normal levels in the fourth quarter. Realizations increased earnings by $95 million, reflecting a 2% improvement in average liquid realizations currently in line with the increase in Brent prices. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects improved earnings by about $220 million. The fourth quarter had a loss of about $30 million compared to a loss of $250 million in the third quarter. Asset sales gains increased earnings by a net $830 million. Fourth quarter results included a gain of $1.4 billion from the previously announced asset exchange in Australia while the third quarter contained a gain of $600 million associated with the sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including lower exploration expenses. Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production increased 152,000 barrels per day between quarters. Recovery from the impacts of Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico increased production by 23,000 barrels per day. Absence of planned turnaround activity primarily in Kazakhstan and the UK increased production by 94,000 barrels a day. The base business bar includes higher cost recovery volumes and production from newly acquired acreage in the Permian Basin, partially offset by normal field declines. Production for major capital projects increased in the fourth quarter by 7,000 barrels a day, primarily driven by the ramp-up of Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico. Slide 10 compares full year 2012 net oil equivalent production to that of 2011. Production decreased by 63,000 barrels per day in 2012. Frade remained shut-in for the year reducing daily production by 29,000 barrels. The base business and other bar reflects normal sale decline as well as the impact of smaller asset sales. Our base decline rate for the year was approximately 4% in line with prior guidance. Incremental production for major capital projects contributed 85,000 barrels a day, driven by the ramp up of Platong 2 gas project, in Thailand and Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico as well as the start-up of Usan, in Nigeria. Our original production guidance for 2012 was 2.68 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. We got short of that guidance by 70,000 barrels per day, predominantly due to the Suriname project and the delayed experience with the start-up of Angola LNG. Turning to slide 11. U.S. Downstream Earnings decreased $125 million in the fourth quarter. Realized margins decreased earnings by $90 million, driven mainly by weaker refining margins on both the Gulf and West coast due to lower demand and higher seasonal gasoline inventory levels. Improved marketing margins only partly offset the decline in refining margins. Volumes reduced earnings by $30 million, primarily due to the continued shutdown of the Richmond, California, refinery crude unit. A return to normal operations at the Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery, post hurricane Isaac partly offset the decrease. Inventory effects represented a $95 million improvement in earnings between quarters, largely reflecting favorable year-end LIFO effect. Operating expenses increased $100 million, largely due to higher maintenance, transportation and environmental related expenses. On slide 12, International Downstream Earnings improved $361 million this quarter. Higher realized margins benefited earnings by $60 million. Lower crack spreads in Asia were more than offset by improved marketing margins and pricing lag effects for sales in naphtha and jet fuel in key markets. Inventory effects represented a $145 million improvement in earnings between quarters, mostly reflecting the absence of negative inventory impacts during the third quarter. Gains on asset sales combined with the absence of charges associated with the portfolio restructuring in Australia in the third quarter improved earnings by $210 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including unfavorable swing and foreign exchange impact. Slide 13 covers All Other. Fourth quarter net charges were $538 million, compared to a net $575 million net charge in the third quarter, so a decrease of $37 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in $99 million benefit to earnings while corporate costs was $62 million higher this quarter. For the full-year this segment had net charges of $1.9 billion which is higher than our quarterly guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. Given the number of discrete items that impacted this segment in 2012, we are upping our guidance range for 2013 to $400 million to $500 million per quarter to reflect several miscellaneous items including increased environment remediation costs and higher corporate expenses. With that, I\u2019d like to now turn it back over to John, for a few thoughts on 2013.\nJohn S. Watson: Hey, thanks, Pat. Let\u2019s turn to slide 14. In early December we announced $36.7 billion capital program for 2013. Our capital program is well aligned with our long stated strategy of investing in attractive projects that will deliver volume growth and value growth for our shareholders. The program supports continued progress at several large Upstream projects under construction, notably our legacy LNG projects in Australia and our deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments. Continued investments in our current project queue is expected to drive profitable growth through the end of the decade. We are also increasing our exploration activities, including the initial appraisal of recently acquired acreage in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Suriname, Sierra Leone and several international unconventional players among other areas. Our Downstream investments for 2013 are directed toward our premium base oil facility at our Pascagoula refinery, expanded additives production in Singapore and our projects which will enhance the reliability and flexibility of our Global Refining system. Additional projects will be funded by affiliates in our refining and chemicals joint venture. Turning to slide 15, our net production outlook for the year is $2.65 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of about 1.5% from 2012 levels. This is based on average Brent price of $112 per barrel, the same average prices as 2012 and does not assume OPEC curtailments, material security or market impacts. Our full-year estimate for 2013 is about on par with our fourth quarter 2012 production. The start up of Angola LNG as well as increased production from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Thailand and Nigeria are expected to roughly offset base business decline and normal turnaround activities later in the year. Although we expect restart production \u2013 to restart production at the Frade field in Brazil, it will not contribute materially to this year's net production. Base business decline is still expected to about 4%. Our 2017 production target remains intact, at 3.3 million barrels per day. In fact, over 90% of the volume contributing to the target is either currently producing or under construction with the remaining volume well understood. We'll keep you posted through the year on developments and progress in both our Upstream and Downstream businesses. We also plan to provide a greater amount of additional detail at our upcoming Security Analyst Meeting in early March. That concludes our prepared marks. We know welcome your questions. We do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to see that we get your questions answered. Sean, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nEvan Calio: Good morning, everybody.\nJohn S. Watson: Hey, Evan.\nEvan Calio: John, I believe you guys hold over 950,000 acres in the Delaware Basin inclusive of last year's asset acquisition and in a larger position in the Permian total making Chevron one of the larger acreage holders, yet running fewer rigs than some of the peers. So I mean how many unconventional rigs are you running and maybe you can discuss planned activity ramp in '13 and whether or not there is any internal constraints for you whether you're limited at all in the people side to accelerating this NAV realization? And I have a second question please.\nJohn S. Watson: Well, we are ramping up rig activity. In fact, we're just looking at some of the material we're going to show you for the SAM meeting that's coming up, and we'll give you actually some pretty good rig count data. And what you'll see is we are ramping up rapidly in the Delaware Basin as you would expect. We got over \u2013 really over 20 in the Permian region that are running right now and we'll give you more specifics about the ramp-up that is headed there. Activity in a fewer number of rigs are running up in the Marcellus region, but that too has been gradually ramping up as we -- as you know. We're still drilling gas prospects there as we have the carry that we're working through. I will be happy to give you a lot more detail on those with precision on the number of rigs. We are seeing volume growth in both of these areas that are part of the plan going forward. You had a follow-up?\nEvan Calio: Yes. I just was curious within that if you saw any internal constraints, meaning you're able to organically, to ramp those volumes.\nJohn S. Watson: Well, we are. Having said that, I think the industry is very focused on building organizational capability and we've added a significant number of new people and added to our drilling training programs that we have in place both in the United States and overseas. And so organizational capability, we're not going to operate if we don't have people that we think are trained and capable and I think there are pressures on the industry, but when we plan to ramp up we only plan to ramp up if we have the right people.\nEvan Calio: Understood. And my second question was, John, I know it's not your favorite topics as well as Pat is the Ecuador litigation. I know still there has been some positive movement there in the most recent quarter. We've read the judge directly implicating himself improper conduct as well as plaintiff, but also your legal involvement is spreading across the globe now in Argentina and Brazilian courts as well as U.S. and Canada and The Hague. So I was wondering if you could just provide any roadmap for activity in 2013 in these various theaters of operation and when the RICO case is set to commence, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: That\u2019s a broad question. I will try to do it simply. First, your premises is correct. We continue to uncover evidence of quite profound fraud in the case and you mentioned that a judge that was actually involved in ghost riding the opinions, based on bribes he was receiving from the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers has come forward and given a statement in U.S. court and has provided corroborating physical evidence to support his allegations that he ghost wrote the opinion for the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers. So, you now have a circumstance where we have through video, through sworn testimony, through email, and other means, clear evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers have thoroughly corrupted the judicial process in Ecuador and this is an invalid opinion. I think that\u2019s pretty well known by you and others out there. I think the question is well, how do you bring this thing to an end? And I would say that we\u2019re moving forward in several areas. The RICO case, the wheels of justice move at a certain pace. We then \u2013 we\u2019ve been moving our RICO case forward, we go to trial in New York, in October of this year. We are actively in the courts, in Hague and we expect there are series of rulings that will take place over time. But there are \u2013 we\u2019ve won virtually every procedural ruling there and expect that we will see some judge \u2013 there were already been some judgments that have been put out indicating for example, the Government of Ecuador should not do \u2013 they should do everything in their power to prevent this false judgment from being enforced, which of course they\u2019ve ignored. And so we do expect that there will be possible rulings out of that panel as well. But there are multiple stages to that \u2013 to those cases. We\u2019ve had multiple discovery proceedings in the U.S. The area that you\u2019re probably interested in is the \u2013 we believe it\u2019s an illegal verdict, but the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers are taking it and trying to use that judgment for recoveries in other countries. Our view has been that any country that on a rule of law will not uphold this verdict and in fact will throw it out. Having said that, we have to defend ourselves. And so we\u2019re doing it in Canada, Argentina and Brazil. You should know that these cases take time. There are number of procedural steps that take place. And so, first, there are jurisdictional issues that are worked and it takes a while if you ever get through those hoops to get to the merits. And our view is that, when there\u2019s been a fraud committed by the court that no government with a functioning judiciary is going to uphold this, and the countries where these enforcement actions have been filed we think ultimately we\u2019ll support our rule of law, but we have to fight it every step of the way; and I can\u2019t put a timeline on that. What I can tell you is; it's not going to reward people that have committed crimes against us.\nEvan Calio: I appreciate it. Thank you for your update.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, good morning.\nJohn S. Watson: Hi, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: Again on the cash pile, I\u2019m still perplexed by what's the large subsequent to the Gorgon CapEx announcement. John, and Pat, can you just remind us again why we\u2019re holding so much cash on the balance sheet in this interest rate environment? Thank you.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure, Paul. We've talked about the priorities for our cash made. I\u2019ll just -- for the benefit of everyone online, I\u2019ll just repeat them. Our uses of cash were geared toward paying and sustaining and growing the dividend, funding the capital programs that are required to make our earnings and cash flow grow, keeping some capacity on the balance sheet for the ups and downs in the commodity markets and changes that can take place in the business and finally returning cash to shareholders through repurchases and that\u2019s been our strategy for a long, long time. You\u2019re correct; we have more cash than debt on our balance sheet. But I think if you look at our capital program that we\u2019ve announced this year where the cash portion of the C&E is about $33 billion. If you look at the cash that we generated this year and you can use your own estimate of what commodity prices and margins are going to be. It would be pretty easy to add at the current rate of dividend and repurchases some $12 billion in distributions and see that our net cash balances will come down this year based on a reasonable forecast. I\u2019ll tell you that between now and the end of 2014 you should see our net cash less debt -- that net number that we talk about will come down over time. I don\u2019t know exactly what commodity prices will be during that period, but it will come down to a combination of significant capital spending which we have underway this year and next, dividends and repurchases the we'll size to get our balance sheet back down to something with a little more net debt on the balance sheet than we've had previously. We have had a conservative balance sheet. Prices have been a little bit higher than we've expected, but we know that there are uncertainties out there and we think that's the best way to run our balances at this point.\nPaul Sankey: Thank you, John. John, you said you're relatively bullish on oil prices and you like the shape of your portfolio. There is a U.S. oil revolution underway and you do seem relatively underway in that area, which is after all your own backyard. What's your appetite to step up your exposure to U.S. oil? Thank you.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. Well, we are investing in a big way in the United States, of course, offshore with our developments at Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot and the exploration program that we have in the Gulf of Mexico. I think you're probably referring to some of the onshore activity. And again, we've had a longstanding position in California that produces oil. We've had a mature business and a lot of acreage in West Texas. And then we've recently added to that with the acquisition that we \u2013 well, we picked up some acreage in New Mexico from Chesapeake. Our unconventional production, we told you last year that our unconventional production around the world, 175,000 barrels a day by 2017 that was not an insignificant portion of the increase in our production between now and 2017 would be in the unconventional and a lot of that's in the United States. And I think what you'll see when we come back for the SAM presentation in a month or so is that number will be higher. And it will be a function of the ramp-up of activity in the Permian area as well as some successes that we expect to see in the Marcellus and in the Utica. So I'll tell you we tend to be returns focused when we make investments. And I'll tell you right now a lot of what we see, a lot of transactions come across our desk but we take on opportunities where we think on a full cycle basis, including the acquisition costs, we can generate solid returns. And right now there are assets that are selling that we think are very pricey. Now, we feel very good about the acquisition of acreage from Chesapeake. That was a complex transaction, but we think we negotiated a good deal there. We feel particularly good -- although it's not oil, we feel particularly good about the transaction in Canada. It's an enormous resource that we picked up that ultimately will produce LNG for export that will be at oil-linked pricing. And so, we feel pretty good about the way we've added to our portfolio given all the opportunities that we have around the world.\nPaul Sankey: Sure. Conceptually, would you prefer the Bakken or the Permian?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, I'd prefer an area where we can make a good return. Being very honest, we don't have a position in the Bakken. I think I've said before if I can wind back the clock and see that well, it'd be nice to have a position. But it's very pricy right now. And to just pour a bunch of capital in there and enter that fray, I don't know that we could make a full cycle economics look very good.\nPaul Sankey: Thank you, John.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.\nJason Gammel: Thanks very much. I just had a couple of questions on LNG if I could please. First of all, revisions to the Gorgon budget are now out in the marketplace and John, I just wanted to or Pat just ask what potentially you've learned from the Gorgon process that you'll be able to apply to Wheatstone to potentially keep the cost of that projects more in line with the original budget?\nJohn S. Watson: It's a fair question. If you look at the Gorgon project, when we went to FID back in 2009, oil prices were in the 60s, the Australian dollar was at 86 or so. And we don't hedge foreign exchange exposure because we think the Upstream dollar is pretty well hedged to commodity prices. And that actually has proven to be accurate. So part of the increase which you saw in cost was from foreign exchange, in fact about a third of the cost increase. The areas where we had some challenges were really in the area of logistics and that was fairly unique to Barrow Island which some of the quantities of materials proved to be larger than expected. And the logistics, there's a large fleet of vessels moving goods and materials onto Barrow Island. And we have learnt from that. So, I think that in terms of things that triggered the cost increases at Gorgon, I think we've learned well about the logistics. But I \u2013 Wheatstone is an onshore project, it\u2019s not on Barrow Island, so I think the circumstances are just a little bit different. Some of the learnings that are key to us are that you better get your infrastructure in order. So, for example we\u2019re working very hard right now on simple things like beds and roads and infrastructure and that is going quite well at Wheatstone. At times, we were impacted by weather as we were constructing the beds and other facilities in the infrastructure, in the early days at Gorgon. There were a number of cyclones that went through the area and that impacted us. So we know that infrastructure is critical path and we\u2019re working very hard there. Now there are number of other learning\u2019s and synergies, if you will, that will come from the people and procurement and other activity on Gorgon that of course will be applied to Wheatstone. So, we\u2019re doing our best to learn from Gorgon and other projects as we move forward. Now remember, Wheatstone went to FID at \u2013 sort of parity with the Australian dollar, so I don\u2019t expect a material impact from foreign exchange as we\u2019ve seen in Gorgon today.\nJason Gammel: Sure. And John, if I could just follow-up please on the comment that you made about oiling pricing for the Kitimat project, that might be considered somewhat of a controversial remark in that, some buyers were trying to push away from oil price linkage. Can you just comment on what you\u2019re seeing in your conversations with buyers about the ability to stay in that oil linkage?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, as soon as it was announced that we were coming into that project, our phone started to ring. So, buyers \u2013 we\u2019re a credible buyer in the marketplace and I think buyers throughout Asia, Japan, Korea, etcetera, are very interested in Chevron and interested in the project. I\u2019m going to show you a little bit information at the SAM coming up in a month or so because there is a lot of talk about the different pricing for LNG and there is always a balance between supply and demand. And what we see is continuing growth in demand, there is a lot of gas out there, but pulling these projects together and getting them online, getting them online in time to meet that demand is a different matter. And I can tell you that it takes a large capital commitment and most companies in the world aren\u2019t going to make that commitment without having pricing that gives them a fair return, and that pricing is going to need to be something close to oil parity or the projects \u2013 the projects won't get built. And so, we\u2019ll talk more about that. I know that there are different contract negotiations going on in the industry but and talk of S-curves and things of that sort, but so far we have been able to keep our contracts on an oil link basis and have expectations that we\u2019ll have strong pricing going forward or frankly these projects won't go. So, I mean, that\u2019s the best way I can answer that.\nJason Gammel: Okay. I appreciate the comments, and I look forward to seeing you all in March.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you.\nOperator: Douglas Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch is on line with the question. Please go ahead with your question.\nDouglas Leggate: Thanks. Good morning everybody. Good morning, John.\nJohn S. Watson: Hi, Doug.\nDouglas Leggate: I\u2019ve got a couple of quick ones hopefully. First of all, a follow-up to Jason\u2019s question, (indiscernible) the price debate in the Pacific Rim anyway (indiscernible) originally it\u2019s obviously that \u2026\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Hey, Doug you\u2019re cutting out and we can\u2019t hear your question. Could you try again or maybe \u2026\nDouglas Leggate: Yeah, let me dial back in. Let me try one more time.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay. Thanks, Doug.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thank you. We\u2019ll go to another question.\nJohn S. Watson: Move to another call.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question \u2013 oh, go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: (Indiscernible) moment.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nFaisel Khan: Yeah. Hi, good morning.\nJohn S. Watson: Good morning.\nFaisel Khan: On the Downstream side, could you give us an update on the Richmond Refinery and when will it return to full operation and what regulatory approvals and permits are required to bring all the units back up and running?\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. We had a fire that was back in August, since that time we've been going through the regulatory reviews as you would expect and going through the repairs that have been necessary, and we\u2019re nearing the end of that repair work and we really have a couple of steps that are left, one is an order prohibiting use which has to be lifted by Cal/OSHA, and the second is our own sort of pre-start safety reviews that would be normal and customary to bring the crude unit back up. So, we\u2019re really targeting the first quarter and I have no reason to think it will be other than that at this time. The repair work is going well. And it's been arduous getting permits and going through the process here in Richmond, but we're working through that and expect that we'll be ready to go here in the first quarter.\nFaisel Khan: Okay, great. Thanks. And just a quick question on the asset sale gain in Downstream. Could you just confirm that the $210 million change quarter-over-quarter is also pretty close to the absolute asset sale gain in the quarter?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Let me just look here for a moment here. Well, actually, no. I mean we did have a third quarter -- there was the asset transaction, a negative impact associated with the Australia restructuring. So, it's the variances what we were talking about. It's a relatively small amount that you're talking about altogether\u2026\nFaisel Khan: Okay, fair enough.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: In terms of an absolute in the quarter.\nFaisel Khan: Absolute, okay. So the absolute number is fairly small or de minimis in the quarter.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. And the variance does take into account the Australia Kurnell refinery structuring in third quarter.\nFaisel Khan: Okay, got you. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: I have Doug back on the line. Doug Leggate, please go ahead with your questions.\nJohn S. Watson: Hey, Doug.\nDouglas Leggate: Hi, guys. Can you hear me now.\nJohn S. Watson: Got you.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Much better.\nDouglas Leggate: Great, excellent. Thank you. Because of (indiscernible) or something over here. So my question was on the timing of Kitimat and the FEED work that Apache had already done. What do you expect happens now to the timeline of that project? And I do have a follow-up if you can hear me. Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: Well, you know what, I'm going to wait until we close the transaction before I comment. Apache has been doing -- Apache and partners have been doing the work thus far and we hope to close the transaction soon and we'll become the operator at the plant and pick up where they've left off, and they have done quite a bit of work. But it's too early for me to talk about the specifics because, frankly, we're not yet in the project per se. So give us a pass for now and as we close the transaction and can follow-up on the due diligence work that we've done and really look more closely, we'll give you a better idea of both cost and schedule in due course here.\nDouglas Leggate: Great. Thanks. So my follow-up is going back to our lunch in December, you had mentioned some concern or maybe some issues around the tax regime in Nigeria. Could you give us an update as to where you see that currently and what the -- how it may or may not impact to the developed? Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, I wish I could give you an update, but there's been a petroleum bill in progress in Nigeria for several years now. And frankly, I don't have any particular update on it right now. I mean\u2026\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, I was just going to say, the bill is currently in the National Assembly, and as John said, it's been under review for a long period of time and we really can't say much more about which way we think this will go. We've been on record as saying that as it's constructed, it's not an incentive for further investment, particularly deepwater.\nDouglas Leggate: So, (indiscernible) pretty far along though, I would assume that wouldn't be affected?\nJohn S. Watson: I'm not going to speculate on where it may wind up. We and others have expressed our view that the ultimate bill that's put into law needs to offer incentive or they'll see reduced activity. Frankly, right now, the uncertainty is resulting in reduced activity. So they do need to come to resolution, but I'm not going to predict how or when that's going to happen.\nDouglas Leggate: All right, folks. Thanks for the answers, appreciate it.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure.\nOperator: Paul Cheng of Barclays is on the line, please go ahead with your questions.\nJohn S. Watson: Hey, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning. John, maybe it's a little bit of an oddball question. Over the last 10 years I think a lot of people, both in the industry and host government, believe the resources become more scarce. You see oil has already been tapped and so they have been pushing tougher and tougher terms. With the last several years of the newfound opportunity set in North America and, quite frankly, I think the budget course and the host government has continued to go up. So have you seen a bit of a change in your negotiation or in your dialogue with the host government that they become a bit more accommodating or that the burdens of power start shifting more back into a neutral zone?\nJohn S. Watson: Fair question, Paul. I can't say that I've seen a relaxation in terms. What I will say is that it's a competitive market out there and countries that put forward terms and conditions that don't allow us to make a fair return, we look elsewhere. The reality is, we have a long queue of opportunities. It's as good as it's ever been since I've been in the Company, and we have more opportunities coming at us every day at all phases of development from exploration, all the way up through discovered resources and other opportunities, and so we can be a little bit choosey, and capital does move across the globe and goes to where the returns are. I'm not going to single out specific countries, but I think you know well that there are a number of countries where activity has ground to a halt, and it's ground to a halt because investors do have choices and they are not going to go where they don't have the certainty of the returns, of fiscal environment and other conditions necessary to invest. So, it is a competitive world. And I will say that some host governments are acutely aware of what's happening in the U.S. and I know there is some nervousness in that regard. But I can't say that I've seen a wholesale change in\u2026\nPaul Cheng: Can I ask as a follow-up that on, in the last say, 10 years that in some times that we have seen some foolish behavior from some of your competitors in rushing in some project and are setting really bad terms. In your discussion and when you chat with your peer or what you can see in your partner, have you seen the behavior change that the people now that believe they have better opportunities set than say in the past so that they are not going to be as maybe they're accepting those unreasonable terms as likely as in the past?\nJohn S. Watson: If I understand your question, you are asking me to comment on the foolishness of my competitors and\u2026\nPaul Cheng: Have you seen a change that in (indiscernible) amount of the business sometimes that unfortunate that you\u2019re only as good as your next numbers (indiscernible)?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, I am not going to comment on our competitors. What I will say is for us is, we have to see the right fiscal terms in order for us to invest. One of the areas we've talked about before that was frankly disappointing to me in many ways, because we worked very hard within Iraq. Where going way back to 2003, we had been providing technical support and training and we had hoped that there would be an opportunity to enter Southern Iraq. And when we \u2013 when push came to shove in those bid rounds, we just didn\u2019t see that the opportunity measured up. We\u2019re always value focused in what we do. We are not barrel focused per se. Those are great resources, but we didn't see an opportunity to make money. So, we politely passed on bidding and moved on to other opportunities. I can't speak for others, but that\u2019s the calculus we go through. We want to help nations grow and develop their resources, but we have to get a fair return in doing so; and I think host governments are getting better recognizing that. I assume our partners have similar criteria. They may come to different judgments on these things. But that's what we're all trying to do.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Iain Reid of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nIain Reid: Hi, John. A couple of questions please. Firstly, I was a little bit surprised you said that there's going to be minimal production from Angola LNG this year. Is there still issue\u2019s with that plant, that are getting delayed into say, the second half of the year or maybe if you could just expand a little bit on what the situation is there?\nJohn S. Watson: I hope I said that there will be minimal production from Frade this year. Frade; we shutdown on a precautionary basis early in 2012, and we are working closely with the regulatory authorities to restart production, but I won't give you an estimated date until we can complete the discussions to settle some of the litigation that's involved there, and the discussions have been good. Angola LNG is different. We do expect Angola LNG to start up in the second quarter, so we do have a partial year of production, and in fact that's the single largest contributor. If you look at our major capital project wedge on production for 2013, Angola LNG is the largest single project. It will start up in the second quarter and will ramp-up over the course of the year. At full capacity, after full ramp-up, Angola LNG contributes about 60,000 barrels a day; so it's significant. But there will be a ramp-up that will happen over time.\nIain Reid: Okay. My follow-up is on your 2017 production. You said that you had 90% of the volumes in \u2013 ongoing in order to meet that. What\u2019s the extra 10%? And I\u2019m just wondering, you still got the fairly low price assumption on that. Do you want to give us any type of sensitivity of what it would be at the current prices?\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. We categorize our projects into several different categories that we have producing assets today. So we have assets that are online today and there is a natural decline to those, but a significant number of those are producing today and will be online and still be online in 2017. We have projects that are under construction, projects like Jack/St. Malo in the Gulf of Mexico. That will be on production and ramped up and will contribute, but it's not contributing today. So that's a project that's under construction. We also have projects that are in FEED or front-end engineering and design and then we have that will come to a final investment decision, investments will be made and they will start up. And then we have other smaller capital projects that have a shorter cycle time to them. So that remaining 10% are typically shorter cycle time projects that we know are coming or projects that have not yet -- are not yet under construction. An example of some of the projects that will ramp up are some of -- the very activity in the Permian and elsewhere in the United States, smaller projects in Thailand and Indonesia, places like that. So, we have good knowledge of what's in there. What we're saying is, is the project itself may not be under construction right now on that remaining 10%. We're going to give you heck of a lot of detail on all of this information as we get up to the SAM meeting. I'll just say that we have greater certainty and knowledge and confidence today than a year ago on that 2017 target. We have work to do, but we know where the barrels are coming from.\nIain Reid: So you don't need Tengiz future growth?\nJohn S. Watson: Actually not. When we first gave you our target for 2017, there was some contribution from the future growth project. We've been working with the government and our partners on FGP. In fact, I was in Kazakhstan late last year and the President was very supportive of the project and wanted us to move it forward expeditiously. It does have a long lead time to it. We've had to work through issues with our partners. We've done that and we expect that startup will be in 2018. So, we've been able to replace the barrels that we had previously earmarked for 2017 from Tengiz with other opportunities. And of course that means that we will have growth beyond 2017 from that very significant project, which only adds to the profile we've talked about.\nIain Reid: Any chance you can give us the target at today's prices?\nJohn S. Watson: The volume target?\nIain Reid: Yeah.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: That's something we can do at the SAM. We don't have the number here right now with us. So, you understand why we keep it at the $79 rate, correct?\nIain Reid: Yeah.\nJohn S. Watson: The 3.3 million barrel a day target for 2017 hasn't changed. And we'll talk more about some of the projects that will contribute. I don't think we made a secret of the Tengiz, the next project at Tengiz is a 250,000 to 300,000 barrel a day gross project and we have about half of that. So, it's a significant contributor but there are other changes that have taken place in the portfolio. There are other opportunities as well. But essentially as that project moved out just a little bit, we've replaced it with unconventional and other opportunities.\nIain Reid: Okay. Thanks very much, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nEdward Westlake: Good morning. Thanks for the call so far. Just coming back to the Gulf of Mexico, obviously that's still an area with a lot of spend going on. Any updates on projects on time, on budget?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, actually I just had a review recently and both Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot are on schedule for start-up next year. They're both going well. They're both over 50% complete. Big Foot, some two-thirds of the way long; Jack/St. Malo is close to 60% along. We've got development drilling that's taking place, a couple of rigs that are working in Jack/St. Malo now. So the progress is good. We'll give you a little more color around that next month at the SAM meeting, but the progress is good. 2014 will be a good year for us production-wise. We'll have in addition to those projects coming on during the year, we'll have full year of activity from Angola LNG. We'll have substantial contribution from Papa-Terra, Escravos gas to liquid and others. So we expect 2014 to be a pretty good year. And pretty consistent with what we've talked to you about before where on this 2017 pathway, the growth would be back-end loaded, and 2014 is when you\u2019ll start to see most of that come to pass.\nEdward Westlake: And then just switching to Shale, I mean you mentioned 175,000 barrels a day contribution to 2017. You may not have the numbers, but just maybe a rough sense of how much of that 175,000 comes from say, the Permian, the Duvernay, and the liquid rich Utica?\nJohn S. Watson: We will leave that one for George to talk to you about. I\u2019ll tell you the number will be bigger than 175,000 barrels a day and we\u2019ll try to give you a little bit of color on that next month. How about that?\nEdward Westlake: I could have asked the question more simply. Thanks so much.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allen Good of Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.\nAllen Good: Good morning.\nJohn S. Watson: Good morning.\nAllen Good: John, previously you mentioned the value of integration given that you never really know where the rents are going to be in the oil and gas business. Given the growing U.S. volumes, your participation in the unconventional and Gulf of Mexico, some of these volumes that may trade at a discount to global oil prices. Does it make sense at this point to maybe reevaluate your U.S. refining position and particularly get involved in maybe some of these areas in the U.S., whether it be the Mid-Con or the Gulf Coast that may see long-term benefits from this or is the focus still more, which is on the chemical side for your Downstream?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah. If you\u2019re saying, are we thinking about buying a refinery, I would tell you, that\u2019s not something that we\u2019re looking to do. Our involvement really is along the lines you described where we do have low cost liquids and our terrific position with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company allows us to take advantage of that, both for existing assets and this expansion project at the Chemical Company has discussed. So, that\u2019s the primary way that we will take advantage of it. Now I will say that we\u2019ve got two refineries that do take advantage of low-cost feedstock. We have a refinery at Salt Lake; we have a refinery at Burnaby in British Columbia and those two refineries take advantage of low-cost feedstocks and we\u2019re always looking for ways to try to get lower-cost feedstocks into our West Coast and Pascagoula refineries. That\u2019s a little tougher. We\u2019ve moved a little bit there, but it\u2019s a longer haul. So it\u2019s not clear that we will be able to take advantage of it in that way. But we\u2019ve got quite a bit of efforts, really \u2013 we\u2019re pretty full up on what we think as goods investments in the Upstream end of the business. But over time, I think these markets will equalize and so making investments that aren\u2019t quite compatible with our strategy in the Downstream to take advantage of what we think will be a short-term phenomenon and it really isn\u2019t something we are looking to do.\nAllen Good: Okay. Thanks. And then you mentioned sort of the premium that was on unconventional opportunities here in the U.S., particularly in the Bakken, do you see more value and maybe internationally where the markets are a little bit less developed and maybe where you can apply a bit more expertise and have a bit more value add on the unconventional side or \u2013 if you look internationally as well, do you see a bit more opportunity maybe where areas you\u2019re not currently involved or you may be able to leverage your deepwater expertise like in the Arctic or in East Africa or maybe even in Russia?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, our commercial philosophy is to go in where we can bring technology or something unique. We favor early low cost entries where we can add value over time through the application of our technology or know-how. When it gets down to a pure bidding war with a lot of different players \u2013 in the U.S., there is a lot of money that\u2019s looking for opportunities and if it\u2019s not a particularly difficult entry for a party, it means there will be a lot of bidders and prices get bid up. So, while the resources are very good and well understood in the U.S. and in many cases are quite prolific, we\u2019re focused on the kind of returns we can get. And so we have made selective entries in the U.S., we feel good about those entries, done well in Canada. And we\u2019ve picked some acreage overseas, notably in half a dozen countries in Central Europe, we have a preliminary agreement in South Africa, Argentina, China et cetera. Those are more exploration plays and are early stage entries. They don\u2019t represent a significant capital commitments, but the upside if they're successful will be significant. We think we will be able to add value. Similarly, in more conventional exploration, there are parties that come to us because of our knowledge and expertise in deepwater, that they want an experienced partner, and we\u2019re able to typically negotiate arrangements that are better than just an open bidding. In some cases, we work directly with the government on awards and in other cases we work with smaller companies that may have accumulated acreage over time. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve added in acreage in Sierra Leone, Suriname and other locations.\nAllen Good: Okay, great. Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn P. Herrlin: Hi. Just two quick ones for you, John. You mentioned in the beginning that you had signed new LNG contracts in Australia. Are those incremental to what was discussed last September on the tour?\nJohn S. Watson: No, I don't think we have anything new to talk about on the contracts. We're over 80% placed on Wheatstone and in the mid-60s on Gorgon. So, I don't\u2026\nJohn P. Herrlin: Okay, I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss something. That's fine.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: John, we were just commenting that that was an accomplishment for the year for 2012.\nJohn P. Herrlin: Okay, I just wanted to make sure I just didn't misunderstand, obviously I did. Next one, on the Gulf of Mexico, you have to do more BOP testing today. How has that kind of changed your development costs given the new regulations in the Gulf, and that's it?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, several things have changed in the Gulf of Mexico for us. If you really look at what's happened, the regulatory environment, of course, is -- obviously, there's a great deal of attention to the regulatory environment. So the permitting process itself takes time, the n-number of inspections that takes place is significant. There are extra casing strings that can be required at times, added BOP inspections, added costs being a part of the Marine Well Containment Company, et cetera. So \u2013 plus other cost pressures that you're seeing in the business. So, we have seen some cost increases in addition to that rig rate. So, over the past several years, it's not unusual to say 20% to 25% increase in costs have been seen by the industry. And that's just the reality of doing business today. Of course, we've got over $100 oil too.\nJohn P. Herrlin: Great. Thank you.\nJohn S. Watson: Yes.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking my question. On the Kitimat project, just taking a step back, as one of the top LNG producers particularly when Gorgon and Wheatstone start up, are you worried that with 30 U.S. and Canadian LNG export plants in some stage of development, there could be kind of a de-linking of LNG and crude in Asia Pacific?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, I think that's been speculated about. Our view is that there are always a queue of projects that are discussed. And if you look closely at what's discussed versus what actually gets built, there is a difference between the two. I said earlier on the call that I don't think that you'll see, what I could call, speculative development of LNG sites without some certainty around contracts and sales prices. My view is, is it's going to take substantial prices to underpin developments of these tens of billions of dollars in spending that's going to be required. And therefore some projects will go and some will not. We think that we have a leg up in terms of the relationships we have, the credibility we have, our ability to construct facilities in our discussions with the buyers. Next month at the SAM meeting, I'll show you a little bit of information about our view of both supply and demand for worldwide LNG and what we see is continued growth in demand and supply that tends to continually get pushed out because the lead time on these projects is long. It's now at a point that -- it's pretty close to six years. And so you can see these projects coming and there maybe announcements made, but until you see FID, until you see construction happen, you have to be somewhat circumspect about which projects will actually contribute to supply. I think that's it. I appreciate the good question. That concludes our remarks. Let me say I just appreciate everyone's participation in today's call. I have given several plugs for our full Security Analyst Meeting that we're going to have in March. We'll look forward to seeing you there. Thank you all very much. Sean?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. "}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-11-02 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. Thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today is Mike Wirth, Executive Vice President, Downstream & Chemicals; and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. Financially, it was another solid quarter. The company's third quarter earnings were $5.3 billion or $2.69 per diluted share. Current quarter earnings are down about 30%, compared to both second quarter 2012 and to third quarter 2011. It is important to note that both comparative periods, second quarter this year and third quarter last year, are among the strongest quarters we've ever had. It is also important to note, as you will see in the remainder of the presentation, that a number of items negatively affect our third quarter comparisons, including swings in foreign exchange and timing effects in the downstream, as well as timing of asset sale gains and other transactions. Year-to-date, earnings are down about 13% versus 2011, which was a record earnings year. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 17.4%, and our debt ratio at the end of September was 8.5%. In the third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the fourth quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount. Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was almost $8 billion during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to just over $26 billion, which is net of about $2 billion build in inventory. At quarter end, our cash balances were approximately $21 billion, and our net cash position was approximately $9 billion. We've had the right strategies and executed well against them. This has led to excellent financial performance, strong cash generation and total shareholder returns that lead the peer group. Jeff will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.\nJeff Gustavson: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 5. I'll compare results of the third quarter 2012 with the second quarter 2012. As a reminder, our earnings release compares third quarter 2012 with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter earnings were $5.3 billion, a decrease of approximately $2 billion from second quarter results. Overall, foreign exchange movements accounted for about 25% of this decline. We moved from a net positive foreign exchange position in second quarter of almost $200 million to a net negative position of nearly $300 million in the third quarter. Upstream earnings were down $481 million on unfavorable foreign exchange effects and lower production, partly offset by a gain on an asset sale. Downstream results decreased by approximately $1.2 billion between quarters, driven primarily by unfavorable inventory valuation effects, lower volumes and lower realized margins. The variance in the Other bar reflects higher corporate charges and an unfavorable swing in corporate tax items. On Slide 6. Our U.S. upstream earnings for the third quarter were $196 million lower than second quarter's results. Lower realizations reduced earnings by $140 million. Although key benchmark crude spot prices were roughly flat between quarters, Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realizations decreased 6% due to the monthly lag on pricing for most of our Gulf of Mexico volumes. This was partly offset by a 21% increase in natural gas realizations between periods. Lower production volumes, primarily due to disruptions from Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico, decreased earnings by $85 million between periods. The Other bar reflects a number of items, including an increase in operating expenses related to higher maintenance and other production-related activities, as well as lower exploration expenses during the quarter. Turning to Slide 7. International upstream earnings were $285 million lower than the second quarter. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $470 million. The third quarter had foreign exchange losses of approximately $250 million, compared to gains of $220 million during the second quarter. As a reminder, these are primarily balance sheet translation effects. Lower liftings, primarily due to planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and the U.K., decreased earnings by $235 million. The gain from the previously announced sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone LNG Project increased earnings by about $600 million. The sale supports our strategies and growth plans for LNG in the region, expanding our existing partnership with Tokyo Electric, who have committed to total LNG offerings of 4.2 million tons per year from the Wheatstone Project. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including higher DD&A, as well as higher operating expenses, largely associated with turnaround activities. Slide 8 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 108,000 barrels per day between quarters. We had previously indicated that the third quarter would include higher turnaround in maintenance activity, and it did. Planned turnaround activities, primarily in Kazakhstan and the U.K., decreased production by 78,000 barrels per day. The second generation plant, or SGP, turnaround at Tengizchevroil, or TCO, started the 1st of August and lasted approximately 6 weeks. This was the first-ever turnaround for this facility and was one of the largest turnarounds Chevron has ever executed. Annual maintenance at TCO Sour Gas Injection, or SGI, facility was conducted simultaneously with the SGP turnaround to maximize efficiency and limit production downtime. More than 6,500 employees and contractors were involved and more than 2.6 million man-hours were worked. Gas and crude were reintroduced into the units in mid-September and production was safely restored. TCO's facilities are currently producing at full capacity. While of a smaller impact, turnarounds in the North Sea at Captain, Britannia and Jade also hurt production this quarter. Production has been restored here as well. The next bar relates to weather. Weather impacts, primarily Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico, decreased production by 23,000 barrels per day. The Base Business bar is largely related to the change in our normal field decline rate between periods, which was essentially flat between quarters. The last bar shows production from recent major capital project startups, which decreased by 5,000 barrels per day compared to the second quarter. We expect production in the fourth quarter to be higher than in the third quarter, as production is restored following the weather- and maintenance-related downtimes I just described. For the full year, we expect to come in somewhere around 97% of our original target. You will recall, our original target was 2.68 million barrels of oil-equivalent production per day. The shortfall is driven primarily by the precautionary shutdown of the Frade Field earlier in the year and delayed startup at Angola LNG. Next, let's move to downstream. Turning to Slide 9. U.S. downstream earnings decreased $346 million in the third quarter. Lower margins decreased earnings by $20 million, driven by significantly weaker marketing margins, which were only partly offset by stronger refining margins. West Coast marketing margins fell more than 40% during the third quarter, while product tightness in the West Coast and export demand in the Gulf Coast, lifted refining margins modestly. Overall, the August fire at our Richmond Refinery crude unit had little earnings impact for the quarter. The Richmond crude unit is expected to remain offline through the fourth quarter, with restart currently planned for the first quarter of next year. Other units in the refinery continue to operate, although at reduced rates. Lower volumes decreased earnings by $125 million, primarily related to our Richmond Refinery operating at a reduced rate, as well as the slowdown at the Pascagoula Refinery due to Hurricane Isaac. Timing effects represented a $180 million negative earnings variance between quarters, driven by the revaluation of inventory and mark-to-market effects on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions. The swing between quarters was primarily driven by rising crude and product prices during the third quarter, compared to sharply falling prices during the second quarter. The Other bar consists of several unrelated items. On Slide 10. International downstream earnings were $936 million lower this quarter. Lower realized margins contributed $125 million to the decline. Better crack spreads in Asia were more than offset by falling marketing margins and pricing lag effects for sales of naphtha and jet fuel in key markets. An unfavorable swing in timing effects, mostly attributable to inventory revaluation, decreased earnings by $340 million. Falling prices in the second quarter resulted in a $190 million gain, whereas rising prices in the third quarter resulted in a $150 million loss. The net earnings impact for the year related to timing is negligible as compared to year-to-date earnings of approximately $1.7 billion in the international downstream segment. Lower gains on asset transactions, as well as charges associated with portfolio restructuring in Australia, negatively affected the quarter-to-quarter comparison by $245 million and $100 million, respectively. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including lower shipping results and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Slide 11 covers All Other. Third quarter net charges were $575 million, an increase of $284 million between periods. An unfavorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $134 million decrease to earnings. Corporate charges were $150 million higher in the third quarter. Year-to-date, corporate charges were $1.4 billion, which is higher than our quarterly guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. However, we currently expect fourth quarter corporate charges to be in line with this guidance. Mike is now going to provide an update on our downstream operations. Mike?\nMichael K. Wirth: Thanks, Jeff. I know many of you on the line are in New York and have had a pretty tough week, so I hope your families are safe and that things get back to normal as soon as possible for you. Moving to Downstream & Chemicals. Overall, it's been another good year so far. We continue to deliver on the commitments we've made and our results back that up. Turning to Slide 13, I'll start with financial performance. Through 3 quarters, we've earned $3.4 billion. This translates to downstream unit earnings, adjusted to exclude special items, of $3.10 per barrel, which ranks a close second year-to-date, based on competitor earnings announcements earlier this week. Year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for the full Downstream & Chemicals segment is 18.6%, which also ranks #2 among our peers. Our relative competitive performance on these 2 measures has steadily improved over 2010 and 2011 and continues to remain strong in 2012. We've got the right strategies and are keenly focused on execution. I'm confident we'll continue to further improve in the quarters to come. Moving to Slide 14, here's an update on portfolio actions and the milestones we've achieved this year. We've exited 8 countries in the Caribbean Islands. We've also completed several asset divestments, including our interest in the Alberta Envirofuels iso-octane plant in Canada; the fuels terminal and former refinery at Perth Amboy in New Jersey; fuels marketing in Spain and certain businesses of GS Caltex in Korea. And we've recently begun reviewing bids for our fuels businesses in Egypt and Pakistan. We continue to place emphasis on core markets. We've simplified our model. We've reduced costs, while returning scale where we have competitive positions, all designed to deliver stronger returns. Our focus is on value, not volume. Now let's move to Slide 15. Here's an update on our major capital projects, starting with Chevron Phillips Chemical. Already a leader in the production of normal alpha olefins, CPChem is constructing the world's largest on-purpose 1-hexene plant at Cedar Bayou, Texas, expected to start up in 2014. CPChem continues to make good progress in developing a new world-scale ethylene cracker at Cedar Bayou and new polyethylene units at Sweeny. Startup of these plants is expected in 2017, with attractive NGL supply underpinning this new capacity. And CPChem's Saudi joint venture, Saudi Polymers Company, began commercial production last month at their new olefins and derivatives facility in Al Jubail. With this startup, CPChem becomes the world's largest producer of high-density polyethylene. Moving to lubricants. Construction continues in our Pascagoula base oil plant, which remains on track for planned startup next year. This will leverage surplus hydrogen capacity and make Chevron the largest premium base oil supplier in the world. Our joint venture in Korea, GS Caltex, is building a gas oil cracker which, when completed early next year, will make Yeosu the largest processor of heavy oil in Korea. This will provide greater feedstock flexibility and additional production of high-value products. And our additive company, Oronite, is expanding its manufacturing plant in Singapore. Upon completion of this project, expected in 2014, Oronite will have effectively doubled the original size of what is already the largest additives plant in the region. You can see the focus of our investment here, primarily into the more attractive chemicals and lubricants segments. As these projects are brought online in the coming years, they are positioned to generate good returns and earnings growth. Moving to Slide 16, I'd like to close with a few observations on market dynamics this year. We continue to see a lot of volatility in both crude and product prices as represented here by the WTI Brent spread and the Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline price. This volatility not only impacts margins but also creates other effects related to inventory, derivative, mark-to-market values, et cetera, that move through our books, as Jeff discussed earlier. Interestingly, the peaks and valleys this year have largely coincided with quarter ends, which tends to magnify these effects, even though average pricing across the quarters would suggest much less movement. I realize that these are difficult to anticipate and model, which is why Jeff provided some insight into the direction and magnitude of these effects in the prior 2 quarters. I tend to look at our performance on a year-to-date basis or a rolling multiple quarter basis, where these movements tend to reverse or offset themselves. On Slide 17, I've got data over a 2-month stretch of time for the U.S. West Coast. The West Coast market -- West Coast gasoline market, in particular, is somewhat unique in that it's relatively isolated from the world market by geography, logistics and product specification. When the West Coast refineries are all operating normally, product supply is adequate to meet demand. In fact, given the demand declines of recent years, we even tend to see some capacity to export. However, when supplies move to the low end of their historical range, for whatever reason, the price typically moves up. This reflects the higher cost of resupply, due to both specification and logistical hurdles and the uncertainty on timing of resupply. This happened earlier this year and again last month when some capacity went offline due to power interruptions, at a time when inventories had already been declining. The move up in prices was sharp until the market recognized that the capacity would come back online and supplies would rebuild. I note this because California has embarked on a path of even greater isolation from world fuel markets with its greenhouse gas regulations. The industry is facing requirements to source blendstocks, like Brazilian ethanol, from relatively small and distant sources, or to blend in nonexistent stocks like cellulosic biofuels. The pressure on an already high-cost supply chain and potential for further refinery rationalization is only likely to further increase the price premium California consumers pay and also the likelihood of price spikes like we've seen this year. Chevron has 2 of the 3 largest refineries on the West Coast with good feedstock and product flexibility. We have the leading retail market share. We've been in California for more than 100 years. We understand these markets and are positioned to compete well through a rule period of change and uncertainty. That concludes my remarks and now I'd like to turn it back over to Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. Thanks, Mike. Turning now to Slide 18, I'd like to focus on recent upstream developments and strategic progress. On the exploration front, we announced further drilling in the Greater Gorgon area with the Satyr-2 and Satyr-4 wells, our 15th and 16th discoveries in Australia since mid-2009. These new discoveries further highlight the quality of Chevron's exploration capabilities and the continued growth of our vast natural gas resources base -- resource base in the Carnarvon Basin. On a related note, I want to point out that the picture that you see on this slide, we have now successfully raised the roof on the second LNG tank at Gorgon. We also made new additions to our worldwide exploration portfolio, having been awarded participation in 2 deepwater blocks located offshore Sierra Leone. We have a significant presence in this region already and are pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the Republic of Sierra Leone's promising deepwater exploration effort. The Sanctions the Lianzi Project, located in the unitized offshore zone between Angola and the Republic of Congo, it is the first cross-border development in the region and builds on Chevron's strong position in West Africa. We acquired additional interest in the Clio and Acme fields through an exchange which was announced in August. This exchange is strategic and fits nicely with our long-term plans to grow our Australian resource base and create expansion opportunities for the Wheatstone Project. Also of note this quarter, we completed the previously announced sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project to Tokyo Electric. And finally, as recently announced, we acquired an additional 246,000 net acres in the Permian Basin. This new acreage, plus our existing acreage, gives us a net leasehold position of about 1.5 million acres. I'd like to say a bit more about this acquisition and our overall positioning plans in the Permian. Turning to Slide 19. This slide shows our significant acreage position, both within and adjacent to the Permian Basin, shown in dark green on the chart. The map on the chart shows our existing lease positions in yellow, as well as the recently acquired acreage in light blue. The new acreage strategically complements our existing operation and provides us with additional growth potential in the Permian. The Permian extends from West Texas into the Southeast New Mexico and includes several component basins, including the Midland and Delaware Basins. Chevron is one of the largest hydrocarbon producers in the Permian, with approximately 114,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day production during 2011. We have over 550,000 net acres in the Midland Basin. Our current focus areas include the Wolfcamp, Cline and Atoka shales, and we are on pace to drill, ourselves and with partners, over 300 wells in 2012. In the highly prospective Delaware Basin, where most  of the recently acquired acreage resides, our near-term focus will be on the Bone Springs formation, as well as the Avalon and Wolfcamp shales.  We are on pace to drill 12 operated wells during 2012, as well as 16 non-operated wells. The acquisition has also provided us access to additional people and resources to execute our base business and growth strategy in the area. While our production in the basin dates back to the 1920s, our existing and recently acquired acreage hold significant future potential as these are early-in-life, liquids-rich unconventional assets in a premier, emerging play. We plan to provide greater detail on our plans in these area at our Security Analyst Meeting this coming March in New York City. Turning now to Slide 20, I'd like to close my prepared remarks with a few key points. 2012 is all about execution, and we're doing well. We continue to progress our major capital projects, both upstream and downstream. We are over 50% complete on Gorgon. Our Wheatstone Project is also progressing well. I encourage you to follow our progress and to view some recent Gorgon and Wheatstone flyover videos and presentations, which are now available on our website. Our 2 key deepwater Gulf of Mexico major capital projects, Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot, continue to be on schedule. We remain confident we are on track to hit our longer-term target of 3.3 million barrels of oil-equivalent production per day by 2017. This volume growth, combined with industry-leading upstream margins, which were $23.88 per barrel year-to-date, is a large part of the Chevron value proposition for investors. Another strong and growing element of value for investors has been our distributions to shareholders. We're currently paying out about $12 billion annually through dividends and share repurchases, and we offer an attractive 3.2% yield. Now this concludes our prepared remarks, and we'd now like to take your questions. We do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to see that we get your questions answered. Sean, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: My first question is for Pat. I mean, I know it may be premature, but I know last year, Chevron made a competitive dividend raise and with CapEx likely higher in '13, how do you think about drawing on the large net cash balance to continue to drive a superior and competitive dividend yield as you really bridge to the production growth and harvesting the capital investment that you're making now and in 2014 and beyond? And then I have a follow-up, please.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, Evan, I think it's a good question, but frankly, I think you've sort of outlined our philosophy there just in asking the question. We do pay attention to and want to remain highly competitive on our dividend stream, and that's why you have seen us, over the last several years, grow the dividend rate at a -- very aggressively, 11% compounded per year. As we look forward, we want to continue that pattern. We obviously do see, once we get into the high-growth periods, when major capital projects come online, we do see significant cash generation coming forward there. We take that into account. We take a look at what our investment profile needs to be between now and then. And all of those factors get brought into the mix. Our view of medium-term commodity prices get brought into the mix. And it's based on all of those factors that we then go forward and have a discussion with our board about our dividend policy. I think it's very safe to say that our board takes our dividend responsibility very seriously and our desire to remain competitive and grow that stream of income for our investors is a high-priority item. In fact, it's the single highest priority of cash use.\nEvan Calio: That's helpful. And if I could have a follow-up to take advantage of Mike being on the call. Mike, I know you've talked about the positive trends in the base oil business in the past and you're increasing your premium base oil capacity at Pascagoula. This is generally a less transparent business, in general, maybe you could give us an overview of just that U.S. market, your returns expectations for this $1.4 billion expansion? And whether or not there's any additional base oil expansion potential in places like Salt Lake, where I know there's also a local high paraffinic crude source?\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes, so it is a market that is a little less transparent, a little less well understood. In broad terms, the largest portion of the current base oil is a lower technology product called Group I, which is made through a relatively simpler process of solvent dewaxing. That is a lower-performing product. And ultimately, as we see specifications evolve to higher-performance standards and engines evolve to meet more stringent environmental regulations, you're seeing the OEMs migrate to a higher-quality lubricant, which is the Group II+ or premium base oils, which are made through a hydroprocessing technology which Chevron actually is 1 of the 2 primary licensors in the world for, and we have some distinct technology advantages there. So it's -- the Group II or the premium base oil market is a higher-margin market, and it is the rapidly growing market, as the Group I market declines in demand. So you've got absolute demand growth for lubricants. And within that, you've got Group I, which is the larger portion today, shrinking in size. And so you -- the premium market is growing quite rapidly with the higher margins. So that's the broad context for that. We've got a large facility at Richmond right now that manufactures premium base oils with Pascagoula, we'll move past Shell to be the largest in the world. And that product will go not only into the U.S. market, but Europe is a large market and has a very high specification standard. There's growth in Latin America. So Pascagoula will feed markets well beyond North America and actually allow us to rebalance some of the Richmond barrels into the growth markets in Asia. We do have reviews underway for additional investments in that sector. They likely would be in Asia, rather than in Salt Lake City, because of the proximity to the markets and some of our existing refining infrastructure that we have in Asia. While you might have an advantaged feedstock that you could use at Salt Lake City, the volumes there would be relatively small but logistics disadvantage to get it to the large growth markets would be nontrivial. And so I wouldn't expect to see something happen at Salt Lake City, but you certainly could expect to hear more in the future about potential projects in Asia.\nEvan Calio: Any comment on returns? And I'll leave it at that.\nMichael K. Wirth: The returns would be well higher than what we typically get out of our refining projects. And we expect returns on these kinds of projects to be up in the 20%-ish range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.\nEdward Westlake: Just, I guess while we got Mike on the phone, some downstream questions. Just an update on Richmond?\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes. So at Richmond, as Jeff mentioned, the crude unit remains offline today and will remain offline through the balance of the fourth quarter, with an expected startup in the first quarter of next year. We are working closely with outside investigators, as well as conducting our own investigation to determine the root cause of the incident and then to share the learnings of that, not only broadly within our own organization, but also across the industry, to try to prevent similar things from happening anywhere. The preliminary results of our investigation have identified a damage mechanism known as high temperature sulfidation corrosion, which led to a general thinning of the piping component that failed. We're waiting for definitive metallurgical testing to confirm that. But it is strongly suspected that, that is the technical mechanism. The questions as to why that corrosion had not been identified and addressed are really still the focus of our investigation. We're working closely with multiple agencies in the city, the county and the regional air quality district, to expedite the permitting process and effect the repairs to the crude unit. That work is well underway. Long lead items have been ordered, and some have already arrived. The work is underway to thoroughly inspect every component within the crude unit and complete the repairs with, as I said, an expected restart in the first quarter of next year.\nEdward Westlake: Mike, and then just switching to chemicals. I mean, obviously, you've got the big ethane cracker. You've got the hexene-1 plant. Global demand for chemicals is still going to grow, but you know the Middle East is maybe a little bit short on low-cost gas. When you're thinking about participating in global growth, just maybe a philosophical question, is it -- are there opportunities for you to continue to deploy capital beyond that ethane cracker, or is it better to just sort of hold with what you have and focus on sort of free cash generation for the corporation?\nMichael K. Wirth: Well, it's a good question. It's one that we spend time on with CPChem and certainly at the board there where our partner participates. We are, I think, pretty well aligned, but we would look for other attractive opportunities. CPChem's real strengths have been in the olefins and polyolefins chain. It's underpinned by attractive feedstock in the Middle East, as you mentioned, and also the position they have in the U.S., which is highly leveraged to NGL cracking as opposed to naphtha cracking. So the keys in that business are scale, cost efficiency and good feedstock pricing. I think the big opportunities continue to be in the Middle East and North America, although you can't ignore Asia, given the size of the market and the demand growth that you see over there. But some of the feed opportunities are not the same in Asia. So we are supportive of growth beyond the ethane cracker, if we can find a project that has the characteristics that have underpinned the success of CPChem's investments here in recent years. And we continue to look for those. And while they may not be easy in the Middle East or North America, for that matter, they're -- I don't think they're impossible. So we continue to look for further opportunities. But we wouldn't support projects that are not strong in their underlying fundamentals for the sake of growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI.\nDouglas Terreson: I also have a couple of questions for Mike. First, I wanted to see if there was an update on the $1 billion return enhancement plan for 2012, meaning, what progress has been made on the operating expense and margin improvement categories? And also, you guys have been -- had continuous improvement over the last several years, I think as you mentioned a minute ago. Are new programs possible for '13? And then second, the plan to close the Sydney Refinery should reduce the losses at Caltex in refining, and while I realize that the Brisbane plant's advantage from a yield perspective, is it clear that it's advantaged enough given the scale of some of the new plants that are coming up in the region, or were there other strategic reasons to keep that plant open? So, 2 questions.\nMichael K. Wirth: Okay. On the $1 billion improvement target that we had set for our refining system, I will tell you that we are well on our way to meeting that. In fact, that was measured against an '08 baseline and that was a multiyear program. And as we began this year, we were closing in on the billion. I can tell you that we are very, very close to that. And I fully anticipate that as we close this year, we will have more than met the commitment there. The extension of the improvement efforts that we've seen over the recent years, I would tell you, are really going to be in the area of continual improvement on margin, self-created margin improvements and continued focus on cost. The big things that we've done in the portfolio are largely behind us. I mentioned a number of those today, and we are closing out some pieces of that. The large restructuring of our organization is behind us. We're managing to hold that in terms of headcount and costs very steady and not see erosion of those benefits. And now I think the future improvements will come in the form of steady, regular expectations for continual improvement, on both the margin and the cost side within the business, as opposed to the big transformational effort that you saw over the last few years. And I think that we have every reason to believe that we can continue to grind out further improvements in that arena. The other thing that will drive financial performance will be some of the investments I talked about, which will add strong returns and good earnings growth. So we intend to continue to improve the financial performance of the business. On Australia, the Kurnell closure was announced, and you mentioned the plant at Litton, which is in Brisbane. The decisions on those assets are made by the board of Caltex Australia, which is 50% owned by Chevron and 50% publicly traded. And so, really, comments on the future of that particular asset are best addressed to them through their IR group. I think they've made some public statements about Brisbane. And the fact that it is of similar scale to Kurnell, and it faces similar to competitors, as you mentioned, regionally, is not something that I think is lost on the board or the management of that company. But they're really the ones that need to address the future of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.\nArjun N. Murti: Just another CPChem question. When that joint venture was formed, I think it was originally with Phillips Petroleum over 10 years ago, I mean, the outlook for U.S. chemicals and chemicals itself was very different. It was more about cost cutting, rationalization, and you've been very successful with that. As the business shifts towards potentially being more of a growth mode, are you still comfortable with the 50-50 joint venture? And I know you've been very aligned with all the successor companies, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66, but is that still the right structure for this asset? Are there other or better ways to optimize value? Is there a requirement for it to generate free cash flow, or would you be willing for this asset to take in cash if there were more attractive investment opportunities?\nMichael K. Wirth: Well, you're a good student of the history there, Arjun. It really did start out in a pretty tough environment, particularly in North America. The first decade, or a large part of it, was characterized by cost reductions and essentially, a fix-it-or-exit approach to a number of the businesses that had been struggling to perform. And that's been a very successful strategy. The latter part of the last decade, we began to see some of these new projects, particularly in the Middle East, come on and those have been quite successful. And now we find a portfolio in North America that's well positioned relative to NGL feedstock. So it's been a very successful venture, I think, for both shareholders. And as you mentioned, we've stayed quite well aligned with our partners even as they've gone through some changes in ownership, from Phillips to ConocoPhillips and now Phillips 66. Both companies injected not only their assets, but really their human capability in the chemicals sector into that business. And I think we've been well served by that. I don't have any particular reason to believe that the structure we've got right now won't continue to be successful for us. We have -- CPChem has actually paid down their debt, and so we've not asked for cash to come back to the shareholders, but rather asked for them to pay down the debt. And they have substantial cash generation capability today, which will sell-fund all the projects that we see on the drawing board for them for the foreseeable future. And I think we would deal with -- if there were attractive opportunities to invest in that business that required us to bring cash into the entity, there's no reason why we wouldn't do that.\nArjun N. Murti: That's very helpful, Mike. And maybe just a related follow-up. You've obviously got a massive Marcellus position in Utica potentially as well. Do the economics of a cracker in that area make sense to you, or is it more logical for the gas to get shipped to the Gulf Coast and get processed there into a potential cracker?\nMichael K. Wirth: Well, it's a really interesting question. And I think there are some different opinions out there on that, Arjun. The plus on the Marcellus and potentially the Utica is, obviously, the high volumes of gas liquids that we could see in that area. What is lacking is the infrastructure, so the frac plans, the logistics and the ability to support a cracker with the midstream assets that are so plentiful and well developed down in the Gulf Coast. And so I think it remains an open question as to whether or not enough of that midstream supporting infrastructure will really emerge, that would give you the reliable supply and the ability to operate a world-scale cracker on a highly competitive and reliable basis or not. Somebody's going to have to build out some of that infrastructure, and there's certainly some of that activity underway. But the Gulf Coast has clearly got that in abundance. And to the extent you can transport the gas liquids to Mont Belvieu and into that infrastructure, that is a real advantage. And so at this point, that's certainly where we've chosen to place our bet on the belief that, that infrastructure is mature and in place. And I think we'll just have to wait and see how the future unfolds for potential investments up in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, et cetera.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDouglas George Blyth Leggate: I have one for Pat and one for Mike, please. Pat, just quickly on the CapEx. It looks like we're running a little bit light versus the budget for the year. Can you just give us an update, do you expect things to be back-end loaded, or are we actually going to come in a little bit less than we thought?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Doug, if you look at our pattern over the last several years, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter and then fourth quarter, we typically are back-end loaded in terms of the expenditure profile. But if you look at 2012 and how that pattern has unfolded relative to the pattern in '11, the pattern in '10, the pattern in '09, et cetera, it's exactly per a typical approach for us. So, yes, I think the answer is, we will be back-end loaded, but it's nothing that is unanticipated or not expected.\nDouglas George Blyth Leggate: Okay. Mike, this one is kind of a double-edged question, I guess. Richmond, obviously, has had its issues in the past and the commentary you made in the -- in your prepared remarks regarding California, we've seen a couple of your competitors talk about whether strategically California makes sense for them going forward given the amount of capital it could be required or cost basis and so on. I'm just curious as to whether you would ever consider either, exiting, I guess, is unlikely, but you doing something different with those assets, or to go completely in the other direction, if there were opportunities to maybe consolidate the West Coast and maybe reap some synergies that could offset some of those additional costs? I was just wondering strategically how you view your position on downstream on the West Coast, whether it's core or not? And I'll leave it at that.\nMichael K. Wirth: Okay. Well, I'll start out with the fact that it is core. I mean, it has been the -- it's where our downstream business began. It's where -- as I said, we've been here for 110 years. It's one of the largest markets for fuels in the world. And we've weathered the good times and the difficult times here and we've seen the cycles. The second part of your question, would we consider some sort of a consolidation, I'll tell you, that's pretty difficult to do from the standpoint of market concentration. We've got -- as I said, we've got 2 of the 3 largest refiners on the West Coast today. And I'm not sure it's practical that we would be able to acquire another refining asset and get that through all the approval processes. So unless something changes externally, I'm not sure that's a realistic scenario. We do look at alternate configurations. We look at alternate modes of operations. We're pretty circumspect about capital investment into a market that has this overhang of regulatory uncertainty that exists today. But it has been a very good business for us. A couple of key attributes. Our refineries sit very high in the competitive stack on complexity and net cash margin. So they're not only large, but they are able to take in a variety of feedstocks. They make a good slate of high-value products and relative to our competition, they generate margins that sit at the very top. So they're big, and they're more profitable than the competition. El Segundo, in particular, also is well integrated into our upstream business. We run a lot of San Joaquin Valley heavy crude at El Segundo. And in fact, a number of projects in recent years have allowed us to bring more of that into El Segundo. And so there are benefits that not only accrue in the downstream but also accrue in the upstream. So it's a core position. It's a highly competitive position. We have weathered the cycles here and would believe that we can make a go of it here, if anybody can, because we know these markets and we've been through the cycles. The uncertainty that you refer to, and I know -- I've heard some of the others in the industry talk about it, California has a go-it-alone plan on greenhouse gas emissions. And it will further deteriorate what is already a weak economy, and it will make no meaningful impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. There'll be a negative impact on jobs, on consumers and by design and by intent, AB32 and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, will raise fuel prices and further isolate this market from the rest of the world. So it runs the risk of disadvantaging California businesses by imposing higher costs that aren't borne by out-of-state competitors, and the policy is one that we have real questions about. So we're working with a variety of stakeholders to make sure that the additional costs and market risks are well understood and transparent, not only understood by the government and regulators, but also consumers and businesses. And we think they need to understand what we're headed into. And at the same time, we're working on our own plans for how to operate and compete in a world where those regulations come into effect and how we can continue to be the strongest competitor in that market. So it's not simple or straightforward, and there are some uncertainties. But we believe we can compete better than anybody in that environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.\nFaisel Khan: I just had a couple, 2 upstream questions. On Kazakhstan and specifically TCO, can you just give us an idea of where we are in the cycle of the turnarounds, because I know this year was a significant turnaround, one of the largest, you said, in the history of the plant. And it looks like last year, there may have been some downtime, too. So I'm struggling to understand a little bit the cycle of these turnarounds and how large they can be, because it has a very large impact on production?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. I mean, this -- the turnaround that we had this time of SGI really was the first time that we have had a significant turnaround in over the 5-year period of time. But there can be intermittent, once-a-year KTL Train downtimes that are just a normal part of the maintenance program. This was a very significant turnaround. It's not expected to have this kind of an impact in successive years here until there's the next big turnaround, 5 years from now. But you can get individual KTL Trains that go down per year.\nFaisel Khan: Okay, fair enough. And then can you give us an update on Angola LNG? I may have missed your prepared remarks on that, but just trying to figure out where we are with the gas to the plant and also with the LNG production?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Sure. I mean, we are still going through kind of the startup process for the plant. We have had some startup problems, and we're not anticipating at this point that there'll be any significant production from A LNG in 2012. It's not unusual to have startup problems as you're going through the commissioning efforts. Admittedly, we've had a little bit more problems this time than we would have typically expected. But we do look for A LNG production, first LNG to be with us in the first quarter of 2013.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Mike, 2 quick questions. On Slide 10, when you're looking at sequentially to the second quarter, say in international refining, the margin is down $125 million. Can you say how much -- I must be missing something, because all the benchmark indicator I track, whether it is in Singapore, Japan, they seems to have sequentially up from the second quarter and all your competitors seems to have that. So is there any particular market that you -- that have seen a down margin environment, or were there any particular product that's important to you that have seen that?\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes, so let me -- it is a little counterintuitive, Paul. If you look at the Dubai 311 [ph] which is a pretty good proxy for Asian refining margins, the 111 is gasoline, diesel and fuel oil. It doesn't include naphtha or LPG, both of which have been hammered really hard in the marketplace. So the realized refining margin that you would expect out of 311 isn't actually a strong as -- what you get isn't a strong as what you would expect, because you get the naphtha and LPG. Couple of our refineries, our GS Caltex and our Singapore refinery, large, and they make a fair amount of both of those products. There's also some crude lags in a couple of those affiliates that can squeeze their margins that you wouldn't see in the 311. So there's a piece of it where the capture on that is not as strong as the indicator. The other thing that's not as transparent, I think, if you're looking at those indicators is, as we see in our actuals, are the marketing margins. And marketing margins are down in general in a rising market. In particular, our large position in Korea has been squeezed by the government and some government intervention in that market and more so than in other markets. And so we've definitely seen some under-realization of what we would like to see in marketing margins in Korea. And then we have lagged pricing on a number of our products in marketing. So jet and naphtha both get sold on a prior month basis. And in a rising market, those prices were weak anyway, and now you're selling at a prior month, so you're selling even at a lower value relative to current in a rising market. So there's a number of components like that, that are not apparent in a headline refining crack indicator, all of which in this market that we've seen in the third quarter, were going in the opposite direction of the stronger refining margin.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Okay. The second question is that on the -- I think a lot of people that has been looking at using railroad, that maybe as a relatively near term and effective way to ship the discount crude to the refining operation. Can you maybe help us to understand if there's any active or major initiative that you guys are contemplating or just currently thinking to ship those discount crude to your, say, 3 coastal refinery or that the opportunities are just not really there for California at all?\nMichael K. Wirth: Well, it is certainly something that we look at. We've run Bakken crude on the West Coast already. We've run Eagle Ford at Pascagoula, not in large volumes, but we do understand the logistics to get those discounted crudes into our big coastal refineries. As you say, this crude disconnect, it's like real estate. It's location, location, location. And our large coastal refineries are distant from where these advantages really are. And you can get Bakken crude up into the Pacific Northwest via rail. You then have the challenge of how do you get it down to the West Coast. You can do that with barge, you can do it with further rail. And so you've got transhipment costs, and then you've got to have the offloading capability in your refineries. And our refineries really weren't set up for large rail-based receipts of crudes. So the logistics are tough into the coastal refineries. They are very good into a couple of our smaller refineries. So our refinery in British Columbia and our refinery in Salt Lake City have pipeline connections to discounted crudes, and they've been able to take full advantage of that. So we have seen some of our assets that have benefited. The other thing I would just remind you on the big coastal refineries, Paul, is they have other advantages that they've historically had, which they continue to capture relative to our lightering on the West Coast and some advantages we have there. Pascagoula runs some discounted Latin American grades and has a lot of flexibility to bring those in. And so you're constantly optimizing the crude slate on your landed cost of crude via rail or versus these other modalities. And so that's a part of the normal business. And we're certainly doing everything we can to take advantage of the discounted crudes in those refineries. But the opportunities get chewed up a lot in the transportation.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Pat, can I sneak in a quick one for you?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, we've got some more folks on the line, Paul. Let's move on, if you don't mind, and we can obviously take them offline. Thanks very much. And actually, before we get to the next call, I just want to make a point out. I misspoke before on the turnarounds, got my acronyms mixed up here. So the SGP is the unit that goes down once every 4 years or so. SGI and the KTLs are down typically once a year. So I just wanted to make that clarification.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.\nJason Gammel: At the risk of exasperating Mike on the California issues, Mike, have you done any -- or do you have any estimates on what the potential incremental cost is going to be from complying with the greenhouse emissions? And, I guess, I'm thinking both in terms of any environmental CapEx that you have to put into the business and any uplift in the operating expense, although recognizing you might be able to pass that on to the consumer. And then I guess really what I'm leading to, do you get to a situation where you may be better off sourcing CARBOB outside of California and then just shipping it to your refineries?\nMichael K. Wirth: Well, there's a wide range of potential incremental costs, Jason. And the reality is, our refineries are amongst the most energy-efficient refineries in the world. And our stationary source emissions are very, very low. The opportunity to spend further capital to mitigate stack emissions of CO2 are -- they're just about tapped out. And so your choices are go into the market to buy credits, and that could be something that we'll see where the market price goes on that. But we really don't have a lot of opportunity, other than cutting runs and restricting supply. And there are some who believe that is the ultimate way that we'll see people comply, is just reducing their coupons, which tightens up the market, which runs the price risk. When you get -- if you get fuels under the cap and trade, which is anticipated out towards the middle of this decade, the costs explode. And that's where you go from costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars a year to costs in the billions of dollars a year. And frankly, all of this stuff has got to go through to the market. We cannot absorb it, and I don't intend to absorb it. And so the expectation is that as we see hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of increased costs, that translates through into the price of the product and that was the basis for my comment earlier that California's consumers will continue to pay a higher premium than the rest of the country. And that is the policy path that we are on. The issue of CARBOB imports is one that we're very sensitive to because if those imports are not subject to some of the same obligations that manufacturers are, then you've got a competitive disadvantage. And that's a subject of discussion with the regulators. And if in fact it were more economic to import than to manufacture, and that's very well what we could do, that's got real implications for jobs and investment. So it's still an evolving and uncertain environment and frankly, we're trying to help people understand that the implications of these things, if it stays on the track that it's on right now, the implications are all bad.\nJason Gammel: As a former California resident, you've got my sympathies.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. I think we're running over our time here, so perhaps one more question and then we'll have to close it off.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Iain Reid with Jefferies.\nIain Reid: Mike, I'll ask you more of a macro question. I heard one of your competitors say yesterday they thought we are close to the bottom of a chemical cycle. I'm not sure whether they're talking about the naphtha base or ethane base, but can you maybe make a comment that? And then also from your perspective, where you think the downstream product market is in terms of demand, growth or decline in your areas of focus, Asia and the U.S.?\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes, I don't know exactly what you heard yesterday. What I would tell you is that the chemicals business has been good for those that have gas liquids based feeds. And so -- and that's mostly what CPChem has. Naphtha-based crackers have been in a pretty tough environment. They are the marginal producer, and with high crude oil prices, naphtha-based cracking margins have not been very attractive at all. And so we do continue to see growth in demand for the derivatives in the polyolefin chain. So if there is a belief we're at the bottom of the cycle because you see market demand growth and perhaps some improvement in naphtha-based cracking margins, that comes on top of what are already pretty good ethane-based cracking margins. And so it very well could be the portfolio differences between what we see in our portfolio and what somebody else may see in theirs, would account for a different view of the cycle. The second question on the broader fuels trends and demand. I am a pessimist, to be honest with you. Europe continues to be a real problem. The recovery in the U.S. is not as, in my view and the things we see through the people we sell to, not as robust as you might believe if you read the headlines. And I'd give you a couple of other specific data points more globally. If I look at our sales of marine lubricants, they have steadily declined for the last several months. If I look at our sales of base oil, they have steadily declined for the last several months. Our sales of lubricants in Asia have steadily declined for the last several months. Our sales of additives in Asia have steadily declined for the last several months. And so we watch these trends pretty carefully because those are sales into industrial sectors and marine transport is a leading indicator of global economic activity. And you can see destocking and sometimes, there's a fake out, where you just see inventories being pulled down, and there really isn't an underlying demand trend. But what we've seen has gone on for enough months that it causes concerns in my mind about the direction of the global economy. I think China has definitely been slower than people anticipated. And you don't have the strength in the other regions in the world as well. So I continue to believe that refining margins, although this year we've seen a little bit of strength, primarily in the distillate part of the barrel, I do not believe the fundamentals for stronger refining margins exist out there. We see more capacity coming online, particularly in China, and I think there are real risks on the demand side of the equation. So we are not building our plans or banking on maintenance of refining margins that we've seen this year and certainly not on improvements. I think we have to be prepared for a tough refining margin market out there for the near to medium term.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. Let me close off here. Let me say that we really do appreciate everyone's participation in the call today and your interest in Chevron. I especially want to thank the analysts on behalf of all the participants for their questions during the session. So with that, I'll close it off and with -- and turn it back to you, Sean.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-07-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Kevin, and I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the Chevron Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Great. Good morning, and thank you, Kevin. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President of Upstream and Gas; and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager, Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. Financially, it was a strong quarter. The company's second-quarter earnings were $7.2 billion or $3.66 per diluted share. Comparing the second quarter 2012 to the same quarter a year earlier, our earnings declined 7%. Upstream was down on lower crude prices and volumes, while Downstream benefited from improved margins and gains on asset sales. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 20%. Our debt ratio at the end of June was 7.3%. In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the third quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount. Relative to our peers as of June 30, we hold the #1 ranking in total shareholder return for the 3-year, 5-year and 10-year periods and actually, for every period in between. We believe this clearly demonstrates the long-term value we are creating for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 4, cash generated from operations was almost $10 billion during the second quarter. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled over $21 billion. This puts us in a net cash position of $11 billion. Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparison. Jeanette?\nJeanette Ourada: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 5. I'll compare results of the second quarter 2012 with the first quarter 2012. As a reminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2012 with the same quarter a year ago. Second-quarter earnings were $7.2 billion, over $700 million higher than the first-quarter results. Upstream earnings were down $551 million on lower crude oil realizations, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. Downstream results improved $1.1 billion between quarters, driven by better margins and favorable inventory effects. The variance in the Other bar reflects lower corporate charges and a favorable swing in corporate tax items. On Slide 6, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $211 million lower than the first quarter's results. Combined liquids and natural gas realizations reduced earnings by $145 million. Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realizations decreased 4% between consecutive quarters, substantially less than the roughly 9% drop in average WTI spot and posted Midway Sunset prices. Gulf of Mexico realizations actually increased between quarters due to the monthly lag on pricing of HLS, Mars and LLS. Natural gas realizations also dropped, decreasing 13% between quarters. Higher production volumes, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and California, increased earnings by $40 million between periods. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including incremental abandonment costs due to 2005 and 2008 hurricanes and higher exploration expense. Turning to Slide 7. International upstream earnings were $340 million lower than the first quarter. Lower realizations reduced earnings by $525 million. Liquids realizations decreased 10%, in line with the decrease in average Brent spot prices. Partially offsetting were higher natural gas realizations, which increased earnings by $25 million. Lower liftings, mainly in Brazil and Australia, decreased earnings by $130 million. Higher operating expenses reduced earnings by $40 million, reflecting higher costs across multiple categories. Moving to the next bar. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects increased earnings by about $425 million. The second quarter had a gain of $219 million, compared to a loss of $208 million in the first quarter. The total year-to-date impact is a favorable $11 million. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including higher exploration expense. Slide 8 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 7,000 barrels per day between quarters. Lower prices increased volumes as the production sharing and variable-royalty contracts during the second quarter, increasing production about 7,000 barrels per day. Average Brent spot prices decreased about $10 per barrel between quarters, which resulted in about a 700 barrel per day volume increase for each dollar decrease in Brent. Moving to the next bar, our Frade field in Brazil remained shut in for the quarter, reducing production by 25,000 barrels per day. Recall in mid-March, the Frade field shut down as a precautionary measure. It remained shut down throughout the second quarter. Base business production decreased 30,000 barrels per day, largely driven by lower Tengiz volumes due to a planned KTL turnaround, a shortfall in rail cars resulting from railroad repairs at the Russian border and lower processing efficiency. Incremental production for major capital projects benefited second-quarter production by 41,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by ramp-ups at Usan in Nigeria and Caesar/Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico. Next, let's move to downstream. Turning to slide 9, U.S. downstream earnings increased $343 million in the second quarter. Improved margins increased earnings by $275 million, driven by significantly better marketing margins in the West Coast and higher refining margins on both the Gulf and West Coasts. Industry refinery maintenance in both regions and continued strong product export demand on the Gulf Coast, combined with a rapid drop in crude prices, generated higher margins. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $35 million, resulting from higher costs across multiple categories. Timing effects represented a $130 million positive earnings variance between quarters, primarily driven by favorable mark-to-market effects on derivative tied to underlying physical positions. The Other bar consists of several unrelated items. On Slide 10, international downstream earnings were $734 million higher this quarter. Refining and marketing margins rose, increasing earnings by $305 million. This resulted from the absence of first-quarter planned turnaround activities in South Korea and from declining crude price impacts across the system. Inventory effects increased earnings by $325 million, primarily due to falling prices in the second quarter, following rising first-quarter prices. Recall in the first quarter, I called out a $225 million negative earnings variance due to unfavorable inventory impacts. The net impact for the year is a $29 million positive impact to earnings. Gains from asset sales were slightly lower, decreasing earnings by $15 million. Approximately $200 million of gains on assets in the second quarter nearly matched first quarter's gains on asset sales in Spain and Canada. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated item including higher volumes, improved trading results and lower turnaround costs. Slide 11 covers all Other. Second-quarter net charges were $291 million, compared to a net $504 million charge in the first quarter, a decrease of $213 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $77 million benefit to earnings. Corporate charges were $136 million lower in the second quarter. Year-to-date, corporate charges were $795 million. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $300 million to $400 million for net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. George is now going to provide an update on our upstream operations. George?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Thank you, Jeanette. It's good to be back to discuss upstream performance and to provide an update on our operations. I'll begin by looking at our second quarter competitive position on earnings margins. So far this year, upstream margins were approximately $26 per barrel. Although not all our peers have announced second quarter results, we expect to continue to lead our competitors in this key metric. Based on the peers that have reported through the first half, we are almost $7 per barrel ahead of our nearest competitor. We have now held this top position for 12 consecutive quarters, reinforcing the quality of our investment decisions, the strength of our portfolio and the consistency of our performance. Next, let's look at returns. Our investments continue to deliver superior financial performance. For the second quarter, our return on capital employed was 25%. This, too, is expected to rank at the top of our peer group. Now I'll turn to 2012 production. Please turn to Slide 14. Our first half production averaged 2.63 million barrels a day at an average year-to-date Brent price of $114 per barrel. Based on the results to date, we are lagging the full year production guidance we gave you in January of 2.68 million barrels per day. There are 4 key drivers that will impact our full year production results. First, the Frade field has been shut in since mid-March. We are conducting an extensive technical evaluation of the area. Once all the technical evaluations are complete, partner support is in place and we obtain regulatory approvals, production is expected to restart and ramp up over time. Timing of the restart remains somewhat uncertain. Second, we have our first major turnaround at Tengiz SGI/SGP, and this is scheduled to start early in August and last for 6 weeks. The turnaround involves more than 6,000 workers. It includes normal inspections and repairs of equipment to maintain mechanical reliability and integrity. We will also take the opportunity to make improvements that are expected to slightly increase production capacity over the next few years. Next, we had commissioning delays at Angola LNG. We originally planned to start up in the second quarter. Commissioning activities are underway, and we've completed LNG berthing trials and LNG tankers are available for third-quarter cargoes. We are currently expecting the first cargo in September. Also influencing our production this year, and I mean in a positive way, are several MCPs that started up early relative to our plan. We have been pleased with their performance. Currently, we're performing at 98% of our initial guidance. And based on the items we just discussed, enough uncertainties remain so that I expect we will end the year slightly under our target. More importantly, our long-term guidance remains intact. Looking to 2017, we continue to expect production to grow to 3.3 million barrels per day at a Brent price of $79 per barrel. Now let's turn to Slide 15. We have an active year of exploration, and we plan to invest nearly $3 billion. The Gulf of Mexico is a key focus area for us where we continue to build our portfolio of prospects. During the recently sale, we were apparent high bidder on 15 deepwater blocks and 15 shelf blocks. We are currently drilling the Coronado well in the deepwater and the Lineham Creek well and ultra-deep Wilcox gas play on the Gulf of Mexico shelf. In another key focus area, Australia, we recently announced the Pontus-1 Carnavon Basin discovery, the fourth successful discovery out of the last 15 wells. We have several more exploratory wells to be drilled in Australia this year. We are also actively pursuing new test areas. One is South America, West Africa cretaceous play. We have an active drilling program in Liberia where we are on our second exploration well. And we recently acquired additional acreage in Suriname. We made a new entry in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. This acreage is in the appraisal and exploration phases, which is consistent with our strategy of seeking early opportunities. We are also progressing our unconventional portfolio. We have drilling activities in the U.S., both in the Permian Basin and the Marcellus, the Canadian Duvernay, Poland, Argentina and China. In the Ukraine, we were awarded a tender that gives us the right to negotiate a production-sharing contract for 1.6 million acres. This acreage is on trend with our Poland and Romania acreage. Next, we'll talk about our progress on major capital projects. Please turn to Slide 16. We continue to see good performance from our first quarter start-ups, Usan, Tahiti 2 and Caesar/Tonga. In the second quarter, we achieved start-up of Agbami 2. We have brought online 1 new producer and 1 water injection well. Our plan includes 10 wells in total, 6 of which are producers. We reached a Final Investment Decision to expand our Bibiyana natural gas field in Bangladesh, where we have a 98% interest. This new project will include expansion of the gas plant to process increased gas volumes from the Bibiyana field, additional development wells and an enhanced condensate recovery unit. The project is expected to boost Chevron's total natural gas production capacity in Bangladesh by more than 300 million cubic feet per day to 1.4 billion cubic feet per day. Our start-up is expected in 2014. We entered front engineering and design for the Rosebank Project in the U.K. This is our first operated development in the west of Shetlands basin. This field holds significant potential with estimated total potential recoverable oil equivalent resources of 240 million barrels. Turning to Slide 17, I'd like to give you an update on our Australia LNG projects. Let's start with Wheatstone. We made a Final Investment Decision on Wheatstone last September. We have achieved our key milestones for the year. We have completed the pioneer camp with 100 beds and continue work on phase one of the fly camp, which will add an additional 500 beds. We currently have about 300 workers on site. Just this month, we cut first deal on the platform top sides in the DSME fabrication yard in South Korea. We now have long-term contracts in place for over 80% of our equity LNG volumes. The remaining activities for 2012 focus on detailed design and preparing for plant site works to commence in the fourth quarter of this year. To date, approximately $15 billion in contracts have been awarded including more than $7 billion in local Australian contracts. The contracts are a mix of lump sum, reimbursable time and material and unit rate. During the quarter, we signed a non-binding Heads of Agreement with Tohoku for LNG offtake. We also executed an equity Sales and Purchase Agreement with TEPCO, bringing Chevron's interest in the offshore platform and facilities downstream of the platform to 64% and our interest in the upstream permits to 80%. We do not intend to farm down any further. With this sale, Chevron's net capital investment is expected to be about $20 billion. We're in the process of obtaining final government approvals of this sale. Now let's turn to Gorgon. Please turn to Slide 18. Gorgon achieved FID in September 2009 and is now over 45% complete. We're making good progress on our 2012 milestones. In June, the first 4 pipe rack modules arrived on Barrow Island. In July, construction began on the domestic pipeline. Next month, the first plant equipment module is expected to arrive. And later in the year, we expect to start installation of the Train 1 compressors. I'd like to update you also on a few areas -- additional areas of progress. Through design optimizations, we have upgraded the nameplate capacity of the individual trains to 5.2 million tons per annum for a total of 15.6 million tons. This is a 4% increase in capacity. Fabrication and delivery of modules are on track. We have completed 2 of the 3 main berths at the material offloading facility, allowing efficient simultaneous offloading of modules and other construction materials. Two LNG tanks are under construction, and we've completed all 14 ring sections of the first tank. The roof is now structurally complete and is ready to be floated into its final position. This strong progress on the tanks has taken them off the critical path, which is unusual for an LNG project. We have drilled 8 of the 18 development wells, 7 in Gorgon and 1 in Jansz, and we're pleased with the sub-surface results we're seeing. Progress on the upstream facilities and subsea pipelines are on plan. We posted several photos of our progress at Gorgon on the web page, chevron.com. You will see links on the home page and Investor page called Gorgon progress photos. I encourage you to check in occasionally, as we will periodically update Gorgon project pictures. Moving to Slide 19. We've received many questions about Gorgon cost. We want to be responsive as we can and provide the insights we can with the information we have to date. As you are aware, the project was sanctioned in 2009 at USD 37 billion and at the current exchange rate at the time of USD 0.86 to the Australian dollar. The stacked bars chart shows the budgeted cost at FID and how they were broken down, 30% upstream and 70% downstream. We have now awarded more than $28 billion in contracts with more than half to local contractors. The contracts include a mix of lump sum, unit rate and reimbursable time and material. The contract mix will change over time as contracts are completed and/or converted. Procurement and fabrication, along with the upstream component, are mostly non-Australian-dollar-based. These are the top 2 seconds on the stacked bar. The other component shown on the bar chart are primarily Australian-dollar-based. Overall, about half of the total costs are in Australian dollars. Procurement and fabrication and the upstream components are on plan in terms of both cost and schedule. Regarding logistics, the 5% component, we have 3 primary supply bases. Activities at the Dampier and Perth supply bases are meeting or exceeding plan. However, the Australian Marine Complex at Henderson, which handles transshipment of larger cargo, has not been as productive. To mitigate, we are streamlining our logistics processes and have added additional resources. We have a strong focus on insuring critical materials arrive in sequence and on time to support construction activities. Looking at the construction and labor segment, we have experienced some delays due to weather. We are still in the early stages of our on-island activity, and we'll need several months on Barrow Island to assess labor productivity. Remember that by design, the project is modularized to limit on-island activities. We've also seen Australian labor costs trending higher. This could impact both construction and management services. Because there are a number of variables in play, we currently have a detailed cost review underway. We're evaluating our performance to date and incorporating new information to update our expectations for the remainder of the project. Over the next few months, our assessments will help us gauge movements in costs, which we expect to provide towards the end of the year. I would like to emphasize that our view of the Gorgon project has only been enhanced since FID. I remain very confident in the economics and the value created by this project. While we are seeing cost pressures, in large part associated with a 20% strengthening of the Australian dollar, it's important to note that oil prices, which determine the project's revenue stream, are about 60% higher than at the time of project sanction. Further, the development well results to date are encouraging, which has greatly reduced the reservoir uncertainty. We've increased the capacity of the foundation project by 4%, and we continue having success with our exploration program, providing us with confidence that we will have additional gas volumes to support further expansions at Gorgon. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thank you, George. I'm turning now to Slide 20. George has provided an update of recent progress on upstream and exploration activity, so I won't comment further on the left-hand side of the chart. In the downstream, CPChem initiated front-end engineering and design on our Gulf Coast petrochemical project. Initial contracts for design of the derivative unit and the ethane cracker have been awarded. We continued our downstream portfolio rationalization efforts, completing the sale of our fuels marketing and aviation business in the Caribbean, along with the power operations of our GS Caltex affiliate in South Korea. And earlier this week, our 50% affiliate, Caltex Australia Limited, announced plans to restructure its supply chain, which will include the conversion of the Kurnell refinery in Sydney to an import terminal. Caltex will continue to operate the Lytton refinery in Brisbane. In support of this restructuring plan, we have entered into a long-term agreement with Caltex to supply transportation fuels at market-based prices. Given the timing of this announcement, the financial impact of this decision will be recorded in the third quarter. We don't expect the impact to be material to our results. Turning to Slide 21. I'd like to close with a few important points. First, 2012 is all about execution for us. We know that and, we're executing well. We continue to progress our major capital projects, both upstream and downstream. Second, our Australian projects remain squarely on track. George gave you more insight on the progress we're making at Gorgon and Wheatstone. I encourage you to view the Gorgon photos on our website. We did not talk specifically this morning about our 2 major deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico that are under construction, Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot, but both of these projects remain on schedule and on budget. And it is these 4 projects that form the cornerstone of our production growth mid-decade and beyond. Third, we delivered a strong financial performance in the second quarter. Earnings and cash generation for the quarter were amongst our strongest ever. And if you look at the first 6 months of 2012 as a whole, where foreign exchange and downstream timing effects each largely net out, you will note the quality of our earnings. Both upstream and downstream segments are delivering leading earnings per barrel and ROCE, compared to the peers who have reported so far this earnings season. At the 6-month mark, Chevron's upstream is #1 on both of these measures, and Chevron's downstream is #1 on both of these measures. An investment in Chevron offers many advantages: a very compelling growth story beginning mid-decade; hugely competitive cash and earnings margin; margins we believe will be supported in the future by the quality of investments we're making today; and the sustained growth pattern on dividends, which are yielding 3.3%. We believe we are well positioned for strong cash generation in the years to come, and with that cash generation, our capacity to increase dividends and maintain peer-leading total shareholder returns is enhanced. Now, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll welcome your questions. [Operator Instructions] We will ensure everyone gets a chance to ask a question even if we need to run over a few minutes. Kevin, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.\nDouglas Terreson: I have somewhat of a strategic question and specifically one with regard to portfolio management where you guys have had extensive activity during the past decade in the refining and marketing business, and your returns have clearly increased. But at E&P, while, I realize that your returns are already about the highest in peer group, as Pat and George pointed out, it seems like that might be an area of opportunity for the company over the next couple of years. So I just want to see if we could get an update on your thinking or strategy in this area? And whether or not you even consider the opportunity to be meaningful for Chevron given your return level?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Doug, are you asking us about expectations for E&P asset restructuring and portfolio divestment?\nDouglas Terreson: Along those lines. I mean there's always areas of underperformance or declining strategic importance. And it seems like you've rationalized a lot more in the downstream than the upstream, and is this an opportunity for you over the next couple of years until the big wave of growth is present?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Doug, let me take that. First off, I would take you to our earnings per barrel and where they stand relative to everyone else and what that means for our portfolio. The average of our portfolio has got a significant shift, if you will, to the right versus what's out there. We always are upgrading our portfolio on a continued basis, looking at the tail end of the portfolio, looking at those pieces that are not performing that well. An example, of course, is Alaska. We sold over 20,000 barrels a day in Alaska that went off our books in December of last year. So that was an opportunity that we took. What we also looked at -- is there anything when we do that, that we can do with that money that gives us better assets? And I would tell you one other thing we look very carefully at, we try to make sure that anything we sell doesn't have future opportunities related to different stratigraphic levels on that acreage. And very importantly, that we -- it doesn't have a technology opportunity to unlock more barrels. We find if you sell out of a place, then you lose that opportunity. It's really tough coming back and buying the same acreage back because you exited too soon. So I would tell you we're cautious, but we do cut off that poor part of our portfolio, and we usually get good prices for it.\nDouglas Terreson: Yes, you're clearly in a high-quality position.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.\nEdward Westlake: Thanks very much for all the details on Gorgon. We're going to be watching that website closely. Just -- you spoke about talking about releasing costs at the end of the year, and we can do some maths given the details you've given. But you've also spoken about weather impacts and logistics learnings. Maybe if you could sort of assess for us the risk of start-up delay at Gorgon as you see it today?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: There's, Ed, always risk with every project. I mean, every big project like this is a constant mitigation of things in the project materials, equipment, contracts that could impact the critical path. And I think we do really a good job of trying to mitigate those issues and keeping any problem off of the critical path. We still believe we're going to make the 2014 start-up. We look at it very carefully every month all the way through the chain. I mean, me and John look -- we spend a good amount of time every month on these projects with our team. So we got great focus on it. We got good people -- very good people in Australia on our project teams focused on delivering, and they're very good at dealing with the mitigations to try to move us and hold us to that schedule. At this point, we still think we're on the 2014 -- the late 2014 schedule.\nEdward Westlake: And just a follow-on in terms of Wheatstone. So, say you get to the end of 2012 and you can sort of make an update on costs for Gorgon, would we presume, given the amount of effort that you have to put in, that you might be able to be able to narrow down costs and start up timing for Wheatstone end of 2013? And then you'll have substantially derisked the CapEx and start-up for investors?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: First, let me -- where we are on Wheatstone is much earlier in cycle. Remember, Wheatstone's 2 years behind. So in 2013, we are not going to be as far along. We will be telling you every time -- every quarter and every update where we stand on percent complete and how we're doing. We're going to provide similar kind of informational Wheatstone progress and milestones as we are on the case for Gorgon. We will be more knowledgeable at that point in time, but we won't have the same knowledge level since Gorgon is once again 2 years out in front. I will tell you one other item on -- specifically on Wheatstone. Wheatstone, when we authorized that project for the Final Investment Decisions, we had used a different exchange rate. We used parity between the U.S. dollar and the Australian dollar at authorization. So we don't see at this point in time the Australian dollar or the foreign exchange impact hitting us on Wheatstone. Well once again, we have to make the same commitment on Wheatstone we have on Gorgon. We are going to give you very detailed updates at every opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDouglas George Blyth Leggate: George, 2 questions, if I may. The first one is, you've kept again your $79 oil price assumption when you talk you about your production target on 2017. I'm just curious that if oil prices had to be substantially higher, let's say $100 or something like that, I mean, you could pick a number. I realize that the strategy that you laid out, that it doesn't necessarily impact the PSC production type of an issue. But what I'm particularly curious about is what it means in terms of production cliffs as you work through costs recovery because clearly oil prices already have been substantially higher. I guess my question is, because you've accelerated or realized a lot of revenue much earlier than you would have done at $79, can you give us a road map as to whether there are any major production cliffs on your major PSCs? And I've got a quick follow-up please.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I think we've been consistently saying we, one, would be telling you if we saw cliffs. We have not seen any of those in the near term. We don't see any of those. We have, in our estimate that we give once every quarter of price impacts, we tell you what it is, and any movements in our PSCs are included in that. Most of the cliffs that I think we have seen in the past, we are past and we will give warnings if we see future ones. I hope that answers your question.\nDouglas George Blyth Leggate: Well, if I may, George, what I'm really getting at is that if you're assuming $79 for the next 6 years, and it turns out to be $100, it's the future cliffs I'm really talking about with that $20 difference, is there any meaningful changes vis-a-vis $100 versus, let's say, your $79 assumption?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: No, we don't see any meaningful ones at this point in time. And if we do in the future see any, we will give you warning or information on that.\nDouglas George Blyth Leggate: Okay. My second one is really hopefully fairly quick. Unit margins, obviously, continue to be very strong. We monitor, I guess, we kind of call it a capture rate, we monitor your weighted revenues and your unit earnings. And it looked like that actually dropped a fair bit this quarter relative to the recent trend. Is there anything unusual that you can point to? Have you seen the same thing, or any commentary you could offer there? And I'll leave it at that.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Our correlations, it still looks pretty good and consistent with the past history for us. There are always going to be some ups and downs when you look at quarters on -- one quarter may have a well write-off or it may have G&G effects in it that may move it around a little bit. But the early stuff that I've looked at, I don't see anything.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.\nArjun N. Murti: George, thank you as well for the detailed budget breakdown for Gorgon. My question related to that is, can you talk about what type of contingency was reflected in that original budget? Did you have a 15% to 20% contingency for potential cost overruns? Obviously, the FX movement is pretty straightforward. But I'm wondering if there is some wiggle room either within contingency or some of the other buckets?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Yes, we did have contingency, but we do not ever disclose what that contingency is or was. We'll be able to give you a lot more information about where we think this project is going, I think, towards the end of the year, after we finish our reviews of cost and schedule.\nArjun N. Murti: That's great. And maybe a related follow-up is if you've awarded $28 billion of contracts, presumably that's primarily on the facilities and the -- what you call here procurement and fabrication, can we think about that portion therefore basically as being derisked? And then we are kind of just down to the labor productivity and the FX and weather you've mentioned here? Can we think about the facilities and procurement as being derisked now?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Yes, in my statement, I tried to cover particularly a portion of that and particularly looked at even full upstream portion and the equipment and the fabrication area. We have good confidence in that. We think those -- we know a lot about those costs. We feel extremely good about our upstream costs on the well side, the drilling side. And matter of fact, all the upstream costs look to be very much in line with our expectations. What we don't know is we don't know labor productivity. We're getting some indications now because we've got the 2 tanks going up quite nicely. But then, we've got foundation work and a lot of underground. So we've got an awful lot of work before we even get to mechanical piping and instrumentation and electrical tie in. So that piece, we just don't know, and we'll have a better feel for it as we get to the end of the year. But we just don't have enough run time to know that. And a lot of our costs, a lot of our costs are -- as we've mentioned, 50% of our costs are in Australian dollars, and a significant portion of that, once again, is related to on-island work. Now remember, we tried to minimize that as much as we could by bringing in modules. That's what we got big pipe rack modules coming in and big process modules coming in with a lot of work to minimize that on-island work.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.\nJason Gammel: George, I wanted to ask a couple of questions about activity in the U.S., maybe start with deepwater Gulf of Mexico. You did mention that Coronado is drilling and that Jack/St. Malo are essentially on schedule. Do you feel like you're essentially now fully back to work there? And can you maybe talk about the production levels in the Gulf of Mexico? And whether you may be seeing an inflection point and would hope to grow from the levels that you're at right now?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Okay. Jason. We have 5 rigs -- deepwater rigs running in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This is the most rigs we've ever run in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This is more than before the Macondo incident. Four of our 5 rigs at this point in time are supporting major capital projects. The Discoverer Clear Leader is on the Jack -- on a Jack-producing well. The Discoverer Deep Seas is on the Tahiti -- on a Tahiti development well, the Tahiti 2 development well. The Deep Seas is, like I just mentioned, let me go back in and say, we've got Clear Leader on Jack. We've got Deep Seas on Tahiti. We got the Inspiration, which is another Discoverer -- is another Transocean rig is completing the St. Malo production well. Then we have a rig on the Discoverer India. That's on the Big Foot. So 4 development projects, 4 of our rigs. We have 1 rig, the Pacific Santa Ana drilling on the Coronado exploration well. And this is the second time we've been at Coronado. We had some difficulty with the first well there. So we're at Coronado on exploration. Jason, actually, we have more activity we'd like to do on the exploration side. We're limiting ourselves to 5 rigs. It does take an awful lot of technical people to really push all these permits through the system. So we're -- I think we're close to what we can do on that. With regards to production, down the road, we're going to see production growth because we've got so many of these large projects coming on. Remember, 2014 is our target start-up for Jack/St. Malo and also for Big Foot. And we are -- the work we're doing right now at Tahiti 2 is to get access to more resources and reserves there to hold production and limit decline rates there. So my expectation is growth. Just a reminder, Big Foot is a 60,000 to 70,000 barrel a day type opportunity where we hold 60%. Jack/St. Malo is 120,000 to 150,000 kind of barrel facility, and we hold 50% of Jack and 51% of St. Malo. So all of these projects are very significant. Like Pat said, these are very significant projects and they're 2014. And once again, they look to be on schedule and on cost.\nJason Gammel: Appreciate all that, George. I realize it was a multipart, but maybe if I could just sneak in one more. You mentioned the Lineham Creek well. Can you to talk about the potential you see in the lower Wilcox ultra-deep from a resource standpoint, and how you're dealing with the technical challenges there?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I think at this point in time, it's a belief for us, like you normally have in exploration, we have existing leases and have acquired in recent lease sales additional leases where we believe that trend on the shelf could be productive. I'm going to hold on how big it could be until we have some results. We are encouraged by what we've seen in the industry, some of the industry wells in that -- for that trend. But once again, we've got to drill the wells to see. And we'll speak more of it -- I'd rather speak more of it after I have some results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.\nRobert A. Kessler: A couple of questions on the numbers for Gorgon. How much have you spent to date on the project?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: We don't share that.\nRobert A. Kessler: Okay. Can I ask for some color then around -- you mentioned the tanks and progress on the tanks taking the team off path, I think you said? Did you mean they were getting faster or slower or what was unusual about that in your sense?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Most LNG projects, the tank readiness for production is one of the critical path items and controls schedule. We've seen that on several projects before that we've been involved with, and the tank work to date has gone well. It's taken all the tank construction off the critical path schedule for the project. So it's a big positive to -- it's -- projects are always about eliminating problems with the critical path item. And we're very pleased where we are on the tanks.\nRobert A. Kessler: That makes sense. Can I ask, on the 45% complete, if you don't think of that in terms of costs, or is that a cost completion, or is that a time completion? How do you think about that particular percentage disclosure?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: It's an activity level completion, which we value certain activities. So I would put it more in the sense of really a schedule, but it really reflects the amount of effort and work that has to be done, activity by activity, and it's weighted that way.\nRobert A. Kessler: Okay. And then the last component from these -- all right.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Two questions. One real short. George, have you guys hedged your FX exposure in Gorgon? And also Wheatstone at the time of [indiscernible] how much,  if you can share? And the second question...\nGeorge L. Kirkland: If it's okay, I'll just answer that. The answer is no, we did not hedge, okay?\nPaul Y. Cheng: Okay. Any plan to change it in the future, or that this will be continue to be the company policy?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I'm going to let Pat answer that one.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. No, I mean, we really look at this as -- particularly when you're dealing with a resource country like Australia when the movement in the Australian dollar is really driven by what's happening in the resource sector, we look at the tide and the correlation between that, and what happens to oil prices typically and have found a very strong correlation. So we have made the decision to not hedge. We are -- we really have a hedge in the overall portfolio.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Okay, that's fair. The second question, George, from an organizational -- I mean, you guys are working on a lot of different projects and no doubt have a full plate. So from an organizational capability and limit standpoint in terms of your human resources, your supply chain availability, can you really -- can you increase your current pace, or that this is as fast as you can run? And if you don't really have any more slack and I know that periodically, people are asking that whether you're going to acquire something that's in mix sense, that when you don't have excess or high-dosed spare organizational capability, therefore, you do acquire anything outside what you already have?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Well, that's a -- Paul, it\u2019s a multipart. Let me see if I can take a quick stab at that. First, when you look at the major capital projects we are having around the world and the organization -- the people it requires to do one of those, we could not add another large project in the execution stage at this point. Now we can -- we're always preparing ourselves for the next set of projects. So we have to stage out people in earlier phases to move the next set of opportunities through the pipeline. So we try to do that. But we could not just plunk down another big project in the execution stage. Now we have to plan for people coming off of these big projects, and that's happening, too. So we try to manage that, I think, in a very holistic sense. Otherwise, on our organization, could we do more smaller projects or a little more drilling? Yes, we have some capability to do that. It's not a huge impact on our capital budgets. It would be relatively small monies compared to what we're presently doing. We don't want to get over-extended on that either. So we try to make good choices on that part. But very importantly, we try to time, once again, next set of projects, get the work, the preparatory work for them ready by the time some of these other projects are rolling off. And I guess maybe one final point, the reason for all that is we want to have good execution. And of course, on the front end, we want to make very good decisions on doing the right projects.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Iain Reid with Jefferies.\nIain Reid: George, can I ask a couple of questions about Tengiz? I noticed the future growth FEED hasn't started that. Are there still issues there with the government? And do you still believe that there's going to be volumes from that in your 2017 numbers?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Good question, Iain. Let me give you a little bit of background, where we are on -- at TCO. TCO has received partial funding for partners for future growth FEED. That allows us to move the FEED forward, and we have commenced engineering on that -- on the FEED engineering for future growth. Down the road, we've of course got to finish that. And then another big hurdle on -- for future growth is also funding for partners, in particular funding for our Kazakh partner, KMG. So that is yet to come. When I look at the timing for the expansion of TCO, it is in the 2017 period. That's where it's planned. It's not a full year's worth of production, but we are very focused on trying to move that project to meet that schedule. So I'm convinced we're either going to have it in '17 or it's going to be in '18. And I've got it in my plan that way, and we look at it every quarter to try to make sure that we have it in the schedule at the right time. And I'm also always looking on my 2017, 3.3 million, about other opportunities that I have in queue that I could offset any barrels that would slip out of 2017. So got a great -- we have a great focus on that. I'll bring you back -- we're going to move that project at the right speed to execute it well, to get everything in place to have an excellent project. And for a reminder for everyone that's on the phone, this project is another big project. It's a 250,000 to 300,000 barrel a day expansion. This project is made possible by the CPC expansion, Caspian pipeline expansion, which is moving forward well. We see the first part of additional barrel capacity coming on the CPC actually in 2013, which is good news for us.\nIain Reid: That was great. And second bit is the turnaround you're taking over the next several weeks, how many barrels is that going to impact? Is it the whole plant or just a portion of it?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: It's the SGI/SGPs, which is round numbers is approaching 300,000 barrels a day. So it's about half of our production at Tengiz. This is the first real big full turnaround for the plant and the compression equipment in total. Like I mentioned, 6,000 workers, a lot of people there. We are also trying to do a little bit of additional work that we think will be improving future capacity, but the real focus at this point is changing out catalysts and increasing reliability and efficiency of the plant.\nIain Reid: And that's all built into your full-year production forecast?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: That is correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Herrlin with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nJohn P. Herrlin: George, you mentioned that the development wells at Gorgon were going -- you were pleased with them. Does this mean that we could see some resource uplift, or greater recoverable reserve potential for Gorgon?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: That's possible. Let me make sure I can characterize that. What we've seen to date is -- we look at every well as we're moving forward. And we have a distribution of outcomes between a, if you will, a probabilistic distribution, and we're seeing outcomes that are greater than our mid-value. These are all static results. These are based on logs. Once we really wouldn't move very much off of that until we got performance, so we got the dynamic results when we actually start up. Now we will take some looks at this, net pay counts and looking at actually reservoir quality. But at this point, we feel very good that we feel we are -- we did a good job estimating, and it's come in just a little better than our midpoint.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: First one is for Pat. Your referenced, of course, the very large cash balance. What would it take for you to consider upsizing the quarterly share buyback?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, Pavel, I think I would just point you to the fact that we had, from a Brent standpoint, a $28 decline in realizations over the course of the second quarter and just point to the volatility there and say -- as I've said in the past, that we keep the cash balance where it is right now while we're in the midst of heavy construction period, particularly on these LNG projects. And that is -- our priority is to be able to fund those projects through the thick and thin of commodity cycles and to be able to weather any sort of downside excursion, which we have just seen. So fundamentally, I think it would take a hugely different and more robust commodity price environment and a sustained environment for us to think at this point in time of moving it beyond the 1.25 billion per quarter.\nGeorge L. Kirkland: We are returning a lot of cash.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, we are.\nPavel Molchanov: A quick one for George as well. Lots of conflicting comments from your peer companies in relation to shale gas in Europe. What are your latest thoughts on the commercialization prospects, and maybe any sense of timing on when we might see some volumes out of there?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: I think we've been pretty consistent on what we thought on timing for shale gas coming out, or gas for shale coming out of Central Europe or elsewhere on the European continent. We've always looked at this as a exploration play. So it's very early days. You have to drill a lot of exploratory wells. You got to understand the resource. You got to understand the performance. We are once again in a very early start of that. My expectations on a success basis, that you're really talking next decade before you get significant volumes. Europe is in a much different situation, and I think actually almost all the rest of the world, on the shale opportunities than the United States. The knowledge level in the U.S. about a shale, I mean, we've -- is high compared to any place else in the world because there is so many wells being drilled in the United States in every region. So your knowledge level going in is high. You're able to more quickly assess the opportunity here, and then very importantly, remember the infrastructure. The North American infrastructure to move the gas is in place. Most cases, you had short tie-ins. You got all these big interstate pipelines. It's a much different situation. And you don't have that in Europe. So there's a lot -- lot of things must happen from the point of discovery, assessment and then moving gas to market. And my expectation hasn't changed. It's really predominantly a next decade, and maybe early in the next decade. But it's the next decade.\nOperator: Yes, our last question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar.\nAllen Good: If I could just try a couple on Iraq. As far as the acreage add there, what is your perspective on the long-term potential there? What's your long-term outlook that you may see that Reliance didn't particularly see there that makes the entry there attractive? And then secondly, were there -- are there any sort of near-term plans for exploration or any other sort of development, or is there a situation we just got to sort of wait out the political situation there until you get some more clarity?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Well, let me start off. We have been engaged in Iraq and trying to find opportunities at Iraq for quite a period. We want to participate in their expansion. We believe what we have in front of us fits with what we'd like to do. It's early exploration. Our preference always is to explore, find, appraise and develop an opportunity. This fits with that. We're there to try to do once again that exploratory work to prove it. We've got wells to drill. We will be drilling a couple of wells in the near term. That was part of the commitment that was made for those blocks. We will be meeting that commitment. So we're encouraged from what we see of the geology. But once again, it's exploration. I don't know what's going to happen until we drill the wells. We feel good about the ability to actually get in there and do the work. We do see the terms -- the economic terms there would be attractive. It would fit in the portfolio with geologic success. So we feel good about it as an exploration play.\nAllen Good: Okay. And is this -- do you feel like it's enough of a position for now, or are you continuing to look and potentially add acreage in the future?\nGeorge L. Kirkland: Once again, we always are looking for an opportunity to expand, particularly where we have a belief that we have a good technical prospect. So I'd just leave it at that broad point.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. I think that wraps things up for this morning. In closing, let me say that we appreciate everyone's participation in the call today and your interest in Chevron. I especially want to thank each of the analysts on behalf of the participants for their questions during the session. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-04-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, and thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Jeanette Ourada, General Manager, Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. It was a strong quarter financially, among one of the best we've ever had. The company's first quarter earnings were $6.5 billion or $3.27 per diluted share. Comparing the first quarter 2012 to the same quarter a year earlier, our earnings were up 4%. Upstream benefited from higher crude prices, while Downstream improved on gains from asset sales. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 21%. Our debt ratio at the end of March was just under 7%. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the second quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount. Turning to Slide 4. On Wednesday, Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.90 per share common stock quarterly dividend. This is an 11.1% increase in the quarterly rate. This is our 25th consecutive year of higher dividend payments. Also, 2012 is an important milestone for us, as it represents a remarkable 100 years of uninterrupted dividend payments to our shareholders. Turning now to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $8.4 billion during the first quarter. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled nearly $20 billion. Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparison. Jeanette?\nJeanette Ourada: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 6. I'll compare results of the first quarter 2012 with the fourth quarter 2011. As a reminder, our earnings release compares first quarter 2012 with the same quarter a year ago. First quarter earnings were $6.5 billion, over $1.3 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Upstream earnings were up $434 million, driven by higher crude oil realizations and lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower volumes. Downstream results improved by $865 million between quarters, resulting from lower operating expenses, better margins and gains on asset sales. The variance in the other bar reflects lower corporate charges. On Slide 7, our Upstream earnings for the first quarter were $76 million lower than the fourth quarter's results. Realizations lowered earnings by $20 million. A 31% drop in natural gas realizations reduced earnings by about $70 million. This was partially offset by a 3% increase in liquids realizations, which improved earnings by $50 million. About 2/3 of our U.S. crude sales are in the Gulf of Mexico and California, where heavy Louisiana sweet, Mars and Midway Sunset crude markers experienced only modest increases in the quarter. The remaining 1/3 of our U.S. crude sales are in the Midcontinent, where West Texas crude markers increased more dramatically. Lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $15 million between periods. We had one fewer day in the first quarter and lower production resulting from the sale of Alaskan assets, partly offset by higher production in the Gulf of Mexico. Lower operating expenses improved earnings by $125 million between periods, primarily due to reduced maintenance activities and employee costs. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including the absence of gains on several small asset sales and higher depreciation expenses. Turning to Slide 8. International Upstream earnings were up $510 million relative to the fourth quarter. Higher realizations benefited earnings by $555 million. Average liquids realizations increased 9%, in line with the increase in average Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations rose 8% between quarters, contributing about $100 million to the positive earnings variance. Lower liftings across multiple countries decreased earnings by $195 million. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $250 million, driven by -- primarily by a decrease in employee expenses. Moving to the next bar, an unfavorable change in foreign currency effects lowered earnings by $205 million. The first quarter had a loss of $208 million, compared to a loss of $3 million in the fourth quarter. These foreign exchange effects are primarily balance sheet translation effects, for which there are no direct impacts on cash. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including a net favorable tax effect, partly offset by higher exploration expense, including dry holes in China. Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Between quarters, production decreased 10,000 barrels per day. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts, decreasing production about 7,000 barrels per day. Average Brent spot prices increased about $9 between quarters. Base business, combined with external constraints, decreased production 17,000 barrels per day. The decrease was largely due to the sale of our Alaska Cook Inlet natural gas properties, a planned turnaround in Angola and adverse weather conditions in Australia and Kazakhstan. The Alaska sale reduced production by 17,000 barrels oil equivalent per day. Offsetting these negative variances were the absence of planned turnarounds in Trinidad and at Tahiti and the Gulf of Mexico. Contributions for major capital projects increased first quarter production by 14,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by the ramp-up of Platong II in Thailand and improved reliability at Perdido, partly offset by well shut-ins at Frade in Brazil. In total, Frade reduced quarterly production by about 10,000 barrels per day. As we called out in the interim update, the incremental impact to the quarter as a result of shutting down the field mid-March was about 5,000 barrels per day. Also reducing production in the quarter was the drilling ban and shut in of one producing well required by Brazilian regulators in late 2011. Since the field -- since the full field shut in, the ongoing impact to net production is estimated to be about 33,000 barrels per day. We are progressing with a comprehensive technical study to better understand the geological features of the field. We will resume production in the Frade field only when we are completely satisfied we can restart production safely and when we have obtained the full support of our partners and the Brazilian regulators. Excluding impacts from Brazil, the remainder of our portfolio remains on pace to meet the production guidance we gave in January. We'll give you an update on the second quarter call. Turning to Slide 10. We've had a number of questions recently about the PSCs in our portfolio. We wanted to take a few minutes today to explain exactly how we define PSC-related terms and how changes in price impact our net production. PSCs currently account for about 25% of our net production. In addition, we have contracts with variable royalties that make up about another 12%. In PSC and variable royalty contracts, production can vary as a result of changes in commodity price, level of investment and operating costs. Some contracts also have triggers that reduce our net entitlement when certain rate of return or production thresholds are reached. Each quarter, we give you a price effect variance and a sensitivity to Brent comparing to the prior period. When we say price effect, we are only including the impact on production due to changes in commodity prices. We do not include in this price effect variance other items that may impact net production, such as changes in investment or operating costs. If a nonprice driver were material, we would call it out separately, for instance, as higher or lower cost recovery. We would also call out the impact of triggers if they were material. Under a PSC or variable-royalty contract, the barrels we are entitled to typically decline as prices increase. As illustrated on the chart, this is because fewer barrels are required to recover costs at higher prices. Moreover, as costs are recovered, the split of profit oil typically declines for the IOC participants. We measure this price sensitivity relative to Brent and the relationship is not linear. Each year during our planning cycle, we create price sensitivity curves and evaluate the potential impact of price across the portfolio. The curve changes slightly year-to-year, but the relationships shown have been fairly consistent over the last several years. We're currently in the $110 to $130 per barrel range, and our sensitivity is around 700 barrels per dollar change in Brent. During the planning process, we also review potential triggers. Based on our last review using average 2011 price levels, we do not foresee any material triggers in the next few years. While rising prices do slightly reduce our production volumes, the positive impact on our earnings is much more significant. For our portfolio at current price levels, there is a 40:1 relationship between the impact of higher earnings across the portfolio compared to the reduction in earnings due to price effects. Let me give you an example, and to keep it simple, let's start with a Brent price of $110. A $10 increase in Brent results in about a $3 per barrel increase in earnings margin. We produce roughly 1 billion barrels per year, so that generates about $3 billion in additional annual earnings. The same $10 increase in Brent reduces our production by 7,000 barrels per day because the sensitivity in this range is 700 barrels per dollar change in Brent. The 7,000 barrels per day, valued at our current earnings margin, is worth about $70 million. So at the portfolio level, we gain $3 billion in annual earnings due to higher prices and lose $70 million due to price effects. Or thinking about it as a ratio, we gain $40 of earnings to every $1 we lose to price effects. Governments benefit even more. Higher taxes on our increased revenue, higher revenue from their share of production and additional volumes from the impact we just discussed. All of this is built into our peer-leading earnings margin, which for this quarter is $26.79 per barrel. Based on available competitor results, we maintained our #1 ranking, continuing to outdistance our nearest competitor by over $7 per barrel. Next, let's move to Downstream. Turning to Slide 11. U.S. Downstream earnings increased $663 million in the first quarter. Margins improved earnings by almost $300 million, driven by better refining margins in both the Gulf Coast and West Coast. Refinery maintenance in both regions, plus continued product export demand on the Gulf Coast, drove stronger crack spreads. Lower maintenance activity in the Chevron system across multiple refineries was the primary driver for higher produced volumes, which increased earnings by $100 million. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $200 million, resulting from lower employee costs and the lower maintenance activity I just mentioned. Chemical earnings increased by $90 million due to higher ethylene margins and stronger sales volumes. The other bar consists of several unrelated items, including lower trading results. On Slide 12, international Downstream earnings were $202 million higher this quarter. Refining and marketing margins fell, reducing earnings by $55 million. This resulted from planned turnaround activities, causing changes to crude slates and marketing margins being squeezed as prices rose. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $130 million, resulting from reduced employee maintenance and environmental costs. Gains from asset sales in Spain and Canada improved earnings by $195 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items. Timing effects represented a $225 million negative variance due to unfavorable inventory impacts during a period of rising prices. This was offset by a favorable foreign currency effect, net positive tax items and higher chemicals and shipping results. First quarter's foreign exchange loss was about $15 million, compared to the fourth quarter loss of about $85 million. Slide 13 covers all other. First quarter net charges were $504 million, compared to a net $553 million charge in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $49 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $4 million benefit to earnings. Corporate charges were $45 million lower than in the fourth quarter. You will note we exceeded the upper end of the guidance range we provided in January. If you look back over several years, you will see this is a typical pattern where first quarter net charges have often been 30% to 35% of the full year cost. Thus, we believe our quarterly guidance range of $300 million to $400 million for net charges in all other segments is still appropriate going forward. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Thank you, Jeanette. Turning now to Slide 14. Last month at our Security Analyst Meeting in New York, we presented our financial results and gave you a competitive perspective based on information then available for our peers. We now have complete information to fully assess our performance on a relative basis and I want to share the updated slides with you. Our overall ROCE was stellar in 2011 and was also very strong on a segmented basis. In the Upstream, our ROCE was 29%, so we moved into a #1 position relative to our peers. This is a tremendous achievement. In the Downstream, we also delivered a strong performance with an ROCE of 14%. Here, we continue to narrow the gap with the top ROCE peer performer. For the Upstream, we have updated peer results for both realizations and costs as depicted now on Slide 15. Our realizations have exceeded those of our peers for the second consecutive year and are now more than $5 higher than our nearest competitors. Our Upstream costs increased last year, largely driven by higher oil prices and the resulting impact from royalties, taxes and fuel costs. Our cost structure is very competitive. Even with the oiliest portfolio, where costs of producing oil are higher than the costs of producing natural gas, we improved our relative ranking and are now at #2 in our peer group. Slide 16 shows the updated cash margin comparison. With a leading position in realization and a competitive cost structure, we've delivered an unmatched cash margin. Our 2011 -- Chevron's cash margins were nearly $39 per barrel and our #1 position remains intact, outperforming our nearest competitor by 40% or over $10 per barrel. This performance is as a result of the strength of our portfolio and our focus on selecting and executing well on the right projects. Turning now to Slide 17. I'd like to share a few highlights of Chevron's strategic progress during the quarter. In the Upstream, both the Usan project offshore Nigeria and the Caesar/Tonga field in the Gulf of Mexico achieved first production. Both deepwater projects are expected to ramp up to peak production within 1 year. We recently announced the signing of a Heads of Agreement with Chubu Electric to deliver 1 million tons per annum of LNG from our Wheatstone Project. With this agreement, Chevron now has over 70% of our equity LNG from Wheatstone covered under long-term offtake agreements. In the Downstream, we sanctioned a multiyear expansion of our Singapore additives plant. The first phase of the expansion is targeted to start up in 2014. We also continued our Downstream portfolio rationalization efforts, completing asset sales in Spain and Canada. And finally, we signed an agreement for the sale of our Perth Amboy terminal, which we expect to complete later this year. Turning now to Slide 18. Looking ahead, we are keenly focused on executing our major capital projects. We have line of sight on many of the significant milestones planned for this year. We're off to a good start and we intend to keep you updated on our progress throughout the year. In summary, we started the year with strong earnings and healthy cash flows. We are focused on safe and reliable base business operations and progressing our major capital projects. We continue to be disciplined in our investments and in managing our cost structure. And as we just demonstrated with our dividend announcement, we're committed to sharing our success with our shareholders. That now concludes our prepared remarks, and we welcome your questions. So Sean, I'd ask that you open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: And my first question is, since we have Pat on the call, my first question is on the large cash position that you oversee. Net cash is growing again in the quarter. And first, on the dividend with the 11% raise versus a 6% CAGR that drives a higher dividend yield and a more publicized raise by one of your peers. So is this a onetime increase or a design to draw down some of your excess cash position over time? Can you kind of provide some color on why and how you made the relatively higher raise in this quarter? And then secondly with a larger portfolio of capital projects and our view of a higher capital budget in '13, should we expect you to run a relatively higher cash position through 2014, when the free cash flow usually jumps and the new project queues begin to come onstream?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, Evan, let me take a shot at that. First, with respect to our dividend, the 11% rate we felt was fully in-line with the cash generation capability of the firm currently and also as we look out. We have strong confidence in our cash flows coming forward. And also, if you look at our history really since oil prices began to appreciate back in 2004, we've had a CAGR on dividends that has been just about at the 11%. So I think of it as being fairly typical with our previous patterns. Last year, you'll recall that we had 2 dividend increases, that combined, gave us a 12.5% quarterly rate increase. So we feel we've been very competitive on the dividend. I don't want to get into a position of having to step out in front of our Board of Directors on this, so I can't provide any future guidance as to what the remainder part of the year might look like. But suffice it to say that dividends are a very important priority in terms of our uses of cash. It is our, in fact, the #1 priority, so we'll look carefully at that every quarter. In terms of the second part of your question about our cash balances and as we look out in terms of funding needs, I think we have been pretty specific in saying that 2012 is really it's the high C&E year. We've got significant LNG commitments. We've got significant deepwater commitments. And as we get further along into having some of these projects move into -- past the 50% mark on their construction phase, I think we will feel better about relinquishing some of our cash cushion. We really think of that cash cushion as being a risk mitigator to be able to handle commodity price swings and margin swings. These are really important projects that we keep completely on track from a funding standpoint, and so having a little bit of cash cushion as we're on this heavy investment phase seems to make a great deal of sense to us.\nEvan Calio: Great, I appreciate that. And second, if I may. I know you recently signed a Chubu -- the Japanese power company in long-term offtake for Wheatstone. I mean, maybe have you seen any changes here in this slope or the oil price linkage versus other offtakes signed for Gorgon and Wheatstone, and any comments just on maybe general demand levels? I know you're going to market an additional 10% to 20% of that gas.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Actually, we've been very heartened by discussions that we've had most recently with potential buyers of LNG, whether it be Wheatstone or Gorgon. I would say in a post-Fukushima environment, we haven't had seen any degradation of terms on these contract and discussions that we have had. Our objective for both of the projects really is to get into an 85-ish percent of the offtake under secure long-term agreements, and we're really well on path for both of those major projects.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI.\nDouglas Terreson: And my question is -- has to do with Slide 15, I think, indicates that operating costs increased by around 10% to 15% annually during the past 5 years. So my question is that with your global perspective, I want to see how you envision this trend evolving in coming years? Or what you're seeing over maybe a term when using the Chevron oil price deck?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, actually, Doug, I think the way we look at this is over time, there's been a fairly steady pattern between an increase in the overall cost structure as associated with an increase in the overall revenue structure. So we have not seen any discontinuities of any -- in any way, shape or form to show that. And so I think it would be reasonable if you're thinking about how to project out using your own oil price forecast. I think keeping a somewhat common relationships in that profile would make sense.\nDouglas Terreson: Okay, okay. So -- and secondly, I wanted to see if we could get a kind of a summary update or brief update, to the degree possible, on the situations in Brazil and Ecuador? There's been movement on both and just any color or next steps that you can provide on these 2 situations, please?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Sure. Let me start. I'll start with Ecuador here. I think the most important thing that has happened of late is that The Hague has accepted jurisdiction and -- for the case, and has basically reiterated their requirement that Ecuador do -- take all means that it can through the judiciary, through the executive branch, through the legislative branch to prevent enforcement of the judgment anywhere in the globe. So that has been a positive step. In terms of the local Lago Agrio case, it has been remanded or is sent to the equivalent of the Supreme Court in Ecuador, but has not yet been accepted there. So I can't give you any more color there. I can't speak to timing. And I do encourage everybody to continue to look at our website, because we put everything that's happening out there on that website. In terms of Brazil, the criminal case against our employees and the 2 civil cases against the company have been sent or remanded to the Rio de Janeiro court out of the Campos court. And we are still very confident that a transparent and an impartial review of the facts will demonstrate that Chevron and its employees acted very responsibly, acted very appropriately to the incident, that we didn't violate any laws or regulations. We will continue to defend our employees to the fullest extent. And as Jeanette said, we have a technical review of the Frade field underway to better understand the entire geology there. And we won't restart production until we have a complete confidence ourselves in the reliability and the safety and the ability to do so, and we are working lockstep with the regulators and with our partners on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.\nArjun N. Murti: I was wondering if you had any update in terms of cost inflation trends in some of your major Gulf of Mexico projects? You've obviously got Jack/St. Malo, I think Tubular Bells, Big Foot, Buckskin, in various stages of progression. I think Hess on their call alluded to potentially some inflation on Tubular Bells. I'm just seeing if you're seeing that across your Gulf project portfolio?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: So, Arjun, actually, we're -- I don't have any specific information to point to. I don't -- there's nothing that's come to mind that is material at this point.\nArjun N. Murti: So you're feeling good about the estimates you provided for those projects?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, we are, and we're feeling good about the schedule for them.\nArjun N. Murti: Excellent. Can you provide a -- just an activity update on the Marcellus and the Utica? Obviously, gas prices are very low. You do have the carry there. Can you just provide any color on how you're thinking about drilling plans in the Marcellus? And any thoughts on how the Utica's progressing for you, if you have any results you can talk about there?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Sure, Arjun. Okay, I'd say the Marcellus, all of our activities are going according to plan. And in fact, we are ramping up, we will continue to ramp up as the year progresses. We're seeing some efficiencies some cost efficiencies as we had expected. Safety is going well, and as I said, production will ramp up. In terms of the Utica, we're really just doing site preparation, pad preparation at this point and drilling will begin a little bit later in the year, And we'll have to report on that in the second and third quarter calls, but it's really just site preparation at this point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.\nEdward Westlake: Just a question on the cash statement. Obviously, $8.4 billion cash from operations. Were there any sort of negative effects like working capital in that? Can you quantity that?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, Ed, certainly, I can. Inventory was a big effect in the first quarter here. And actually, as you look at the variance compared to fourth quarter, it's an even bigger variance. So we had a drawdown in inventory in the fourth quarter that released cash of about $0.5 billion dollars, and we had a build of inventory in the first quarter that consumed cash by about $1.8 billion. So you have over a $2 billion swing there in just inventory alone on cash.\nEdward Westlake: Right, okay. So I mean, if I add that back -- cash flow probably before working capital would be somewhere over $10 billion?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, be close -- very good.\nEdward Westlake: Yes, just on the -- the CapEx run rate seems a bit low at the -- just at the beginning of the year. Is that just the usual timing?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Actually, it is. We look at this every year and we have a typical pattern. And first quarter 2012 looks just like the first quarter of the last 7 years in terms of its rate of spending relative to the full year spending.\nEdward Westlake: Right. And then just to follow up on our operational side, any update in terms of activity rates as you perhaps start to delineate some of the shale that you have in the Permian?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I don't know that I've got anything more than what we said just a month ago or so. The overall activity level, our expectation was to have about 200 wells, participation in 200 wells over the course of the year and that is exactly where we exactly where we sit.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering & Holt.\nRobert A. Kessler: Can I ask for a little bit more color around the variability in your operating expense? It just strikes me as interesting that basically both key segments in both the U.S. and international swung the same direction, both last quarter as a negative and this quarter as a positive. And you seem to mention in all cases employee cost as a variable there. It seems to imply that there's some sort of common central variance that's allocated as an overhead to the segments. Severance, for example, or something like that. Is that in fact the case? And if so can you speak to any underlying cost trends unique to the segments on OpEx as opposed to a corporate-level allocation?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Sure. You picked up exactly on some of the messaging that we had there. We've got a compensation system where we have pay at risk for a large part of our employee population. And so the payment is awarded based on performance against targets and also relative competitive performance. So we make an assessment in the fourth quarter of each year as to how well we've done, and 2011 was a strong performance year for us. And that's really what you see as the variance between the costs incurred in the fourth quarter and then the absence of those costs really here in the fourth quarter. That's really one of the primary drivers that you see. In terms of the overall cost structure around the globe, they're really -- other than this one particular variance that I've talked to, there hasn't been anything of significance that is noteworthy or different.\nRobert A. Kessler: Would you characterize your Upstream kind of global lease operating expenses relatively steady over the last couple of quarters?\nJeanette Ourada: Yes, I think it has been fairly steady over the last couple of quarters. If you recall, in 2011, we did call out -- it's about a $1.3 billion increase in operating expense due to a gas for oil swap agreement, and it was replaced with a purchasing agreement in Indonesia. So if you're looking at year-over-year, that may be what you're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel of Macquarie.\nJason Gammel: I had 2 actually, if I could, please. First, Angola LNG. Would you say you're still on schedule to potentially lift the cargo from the project in June? And would you expect that you would be sending most of these cargoes into Asia rather than the original plan of moving to the Gulf Coast? And also, how should we think about production from Angola LNG? Are you guys actually able to recognize equity gas here or is this gas that actually belongs to Senegal?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. So in terms of the cargo, our expectation is that the first cargo would be available and lifted in sort of the middle of this quarter here, certainly by the end of the second quarter. In terms of ownership of that cargo, we believe the first offtaker will be one of the partners, but it's not clear yet. I don't think the decision has been made yet as to who that necessarily will be. And in terms of the gas ownership, it's ours.\nJeanette Ourada: And we will recognize production as LNG is produced.\nJason Gammel: Okay, that's great. And then I'm just trying to think about second quarter volumes at this point. The liftings difference that you showed in the variance chart, were you actually underlifted in 1Q and would expect to make up those volumes in 2Q? And do you have any significant maintenance activity that we should be thinking about for 2Q?\nJeanette Ourada: So remember when we showed the liftings, really what that is, is a variance of sales between quarters. So if you just want to look at the under/overlift within the quarter, we had a very slight overlift in the first quarter. It's about 0.5%.\nJason Gammel: Okay, great. And any planned maintenance?\nJeanette Ourada: Well, we won't -- we don't forecast for the second quarter, but we did have about 50,000 barrels a day. Well, that's a variance between -- we had a substantial amount in the first quarter and quite substantial at TCO.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Two questions, if I could. One, Pat, can you talk about whether any of your investment program in Argentina, either in your thinking or that the actual spending level may or may not have changed after the recent nationalization announcement of YPF? The second one in Venezuela, you have, I think, a couple of years ago signed a new agreement with PDVSA on a heavy oil upgrading project, Carabobo 3. I think that you may actually have pay some upfront fees for that or a bonus for that. I want to see if there's any status update on that one.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, sure. First of all in Argentina, I would just say that any time you see an expropriation of assets like has occurred and you're an IOC and you go in under certain contract terms and places all around the globe and you see that happening in a location, it does give you pause. I mean, we do believe in contract sanctity and so it makes you certainly sit up and take notice. In terms of our particular activity, there hasn't been any change. In fact, we did just extend our concession extension in the El Trapial concession for an additional 10 years now. We have a concession now to 2032. So work continues apace there, but we do certainly take notice of it, that's for sure. In terms of Venezuela, both in our Carabobo and our Delta creek project stay, under the evaluation phase, we're working hard to identify appropriate kind of commercial development opportunities there.\nPaul Y. Cheng: So you don't actually have any actual spending or major spending in those project yet?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: We don't have any major spending on those projects at this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: Back to the balance sheet, Pat, you've got 6.9% debt ratio presented here, which obviously is the gross debt right? So the net debt is closer to over 8% cash positive?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Correct.\nPaul Sankey: And there's $19 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Firstly, I was wondering about the debt paydown. What was the rationale for that, given -- I would have thought it's better to carry more, not less, in this interested rate environment?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right, and that was just an internal operational event for us. We happened to move from a proprietary issuance of commercial paper to a dealer issuance. We just decided that it wasn't a business we needed to be in. We made the transition at the end of the first quarter here. And while we were doing that transition, we just wanted to get the balances down low just to make sure we didn't have any glitches anywhere. So that's just strictly an internal Chevron operational thing, so I wouldn't read anything into that.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. The -- to retain the AA rating, which I know you've repeated many times, is a key aim, I guess you could probably carry about $10 billion of net debt without threatening that?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, actually, Paul, the way I look at it is it really depends on what you're using the borrowing for. If you have significant commercial opportunities or M&A opportunities or whatever, I mean, the substance of the increase in the debt is really important for evaluating for the rating agencies, how they view your creditworthiness. And they take into account a lot more than just the financial parameters as you now know. They look at a lot of our Upstream and Downstream operating performance parameters and assessing that rating. So I think we have a tremendous amount of borrowing capacity under the right circumstances and still have the ability to maintain the AA.\nPaul Sankey: Yes, I guess, what I'm driving at is the scale of the safety cushion you've got here does seem to be kind of extreme with $19 billion of cash. I would have thought that you could be very, very safe and not have to carry quite so much, unless this is going to be the mother of all CapEx overruns.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: No, we're not anticipating -- using your [ph] terminology here, I don't want to even use that phrase again, but we're not anticipating overruns on our capital program. It really is a circumstance for keeping some cushion now while we're in this heavy investment period and acknowledging that you've got the opportunity. It may be a very low opportunity or very low probability for excursion south on crude prices or real deterioration in margins, but we want to make sure that we've got enough to live through this heavy investment phase.\nPaul Sankey: Yes, okay, because I was just thinking that kind of more buyback, because you haven't -- the buyback's basically unchanged, right? So...\nPatricia E. Yarrington: That's right. And we will look at the buybacks every quarter. We do it every quarter. This quarter, we were focused on the dividend here, which I think was a tremendously strong message about our confidence in future cash flows. Obviously as we go and as every quarter goes by and you've got reasonably higher oil prices, we continue to move the projects through to a higher stage of completion, then obviously, our requirements around cash lessen. And we will evaluate the share repurchase program as we do every quarter with our Board of Directors.\nPaul Sankey: Yes, and I think -- you stated, if I recall, at the Analyst Meeting that you felt that it was going to be kind of end 2013 that you would be, if you like, more confident about CapEx, final CapEx numbers in the safe?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I don't recall giving a 2013 date. I just -- we just know that we've got these significant projects, Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot, Deepwater, Nigeria, et cetera, where we've got a large profile here for 2012, and certainly, the LNG continuing here into 2013.\nPaul Sankey: Got you. And my second question would be on volumes for this year. Forgive me if I missed this, but is there a guidance? I mean, you had a -- previously had a, if you like, a target for the year. Is there a reset number for that for 2012?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: At this point, we're sticking with the guidance that we gave at the very beginning of the year. We did acknowledge here as much information as we have about Frade. George will be on the call here in the second quarter, and we'll update you at that point in time. I'll just say as we look forward, the things that are important to us here, the portfolio is performing on plan, outside of Frade, so we feel good about the number that we gave, again, outside of Frade. Frade, we don't have enough information to be able to say how that will play out here in the second quarter, third quarter, et cetera. The ramp-up of ALNG is an important parameter for us. The ramp-up of Usan is an important parameter for us, and the TCO, SGI/SGP turnaround is an important parameter, and all of those will be important factors in 2012 production.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: Just 2 quick Upstream ones. First, U.S. gas production was down about 10% from the fourth quarter. Was that a price-related shut-in?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, U.S. gas would be the Alaska Cook Inlet sale. That property alone -- that property sale alone was worth about 17,000 barrels a day on a BOE basis.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay, so no shut-ins in your existing assets there?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: No, I mean, I will say that we are -- we already have our portfolio and we have been working our portfolio to as minimal dry gas as we possibly can. The only exception that we've got going there would be Marcellus, and Marcellus has got the $1.3 billion carry. I guess it's actually now about a $1.2 billion carry because we've used some of it now since March. But we are definitely focused on liquids-rich plays.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay. And then on Liberia, can you just confirm that the first prospect is in fact spudding this week, and maybe provide a time line for results from that?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, we -- I can tell you that its spudding is imminent. I hate to go out further on a limb than that, and I really don't have any more information as to how long it will be and what the evaluation period will be, et cetera. So...\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.\nFaisel Khan: On your -- could you give us a little bit of an update on your exploration -- the exploration wells you drilled in the first quarter? I believe you were still looking for results from Bear's Hump and then you were drilling a well in the Duvernay and the Pearl Mouth Basin in China. And also if you can give us a little bit of an update on what you will try to drill in the second quarter?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, so Bear's Hump is -- the drilling results are basically are still being evaluated. In the Duvernay, we are on our third well, and we are, I guess I would say, encouraged from that standpoint. And what was the third area?\nJeanette Ourada: China.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Oh, China. So China, we did have our third dry hole. That was -- the quarter recognized 2 of those dry holes here. And so we've had our third dry hole, 1 each in the 3 blocks. But I will say we have significant acreage there and some of the results were encouraging, and those results will be used then to help us do the next site selection for the follow-on drilling program.\nFaisel Khan: Okay. And then your future lineup here for the second quarter? I believe you're going to spud Coronado or have you already spud that well?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: No, Coronado would be later in the year. I don't have a definitive time for Coronado. And most of our drilling rig activity right now in the Gulf of Mexico are focused on development wells. We've got 4 rigs drilling on development wells for the Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot properties. And we have the Santa Ana coming, which actually is in the Gulf of Mexico now and will be soon available for drilling operations.\nFaisel Khan: Okay. Can you give us an update on North American onshore rig activity? How many rigs are you running in North America, and how many of those are devoted to kind of liquids-rich or oil-rich plays?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, I don't have specific rig activity in North America. I can just tell you that in the Marcellus, we continue to execute the evaluation and development plan that we laid out. You'll see a gradual ramp-up in Marcellus production over the course of the year. And Wolfcamp, we were pretty specific in saying we expected to participate in 200 wells there. Those are liquids-rich plays. And I guess I would say from a -- going back to the natural gas versus crude or liquids component there, I mean, all of the gas that we've got here really is liquids focused. Everything that we're producing is cash breakeven or better on the natural gas side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Iain Reid of Jefferies.\nIain Reid: Can I come back to your production, your PSC sensitivity guidance? This is very useful, actually. And on the trigger part of it, I think you said that there's no triggers coming from rate of return or production thresholds over the next few years. Is it possible to say what oil price you assess that at?\nJeanette Ourada: Yes, we used the 2011 average prices, so around $110 per barrel for that sensitivity.\nIain Reid: Okay, and that includes fields which have just started up, such as Usan, I presume?\nJeanette Ourada: Yes, that included the whole portfolio. We create a curve for each PSC and then combine them together and test each one and then test at the portfolio level.\nIain Reid: Okay. And on cost oil -- cost recovery, is it possible to say -- is there any kind of major fields coming out of the major part of cost oil, which is the CapEx recovery over a similar period?\nJeanette Ourada: Over that same period, not a lot, I would say. So if you would have asked me 2 years ago, we probably would have talked about Agbami. But I think we've talked about -- we pushed Agbami 2 back a little bit, because the first set of wells were performing exceptionally well. And pushing Agbami 2 investment back a bit has really muted any type of decline you see in cost oil.\nIain Reid: Okay, and nothing in Angola?\nJeanette Ourada: Nothing material in Angola, no.\nIain Reid: Okay, okay, interesting. And on a different topic, could you tell us what the status is of the Nigerian gas blowout?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, actually. So we continue at this point to drill the relief well and to set ourselves up to permanently plug and abandon it. We haven't had any gas detected from the well since the fire stopped burning in the very early part of March. The relief well is fairly close to the intersection point. And our expectation at this point would be that if we're successful there, then we would a permanently abandoned well by the end of May.\nIain Reid: Okay. And what sort of production has been shut-in due to this? A few thousand barrels a day, huh?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: It's very, very, very modest. It is just 2,000 barrels a day.\nIain Reid: And there's been no knock-on effect from regulators, those Brazilian style labor [ph] reaction?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: No, we have been working very closely with the Nigerian government and the regulators, the local communities to move this along constructively.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate Minyard of JPMorgan.\nKatherine Lucas Minyard: Just a quick point of clarification. On Slide 9, you walked through the variability in production versus the prior quarter. And if I caught you correctly, I believe you said the Alaska sale was about a 17,000 barrel equivalent per day impact. But then you also had mentioned the Angola turnaround. So it looks like the Alaska sale might have accounted for the entire block of net production constraints or the impact on the base business? Or am I -- was it a timing issue with the Alaska sale?\nJeanette Ourada: Thanks, Kate. There's certainly a lot embedded in that 17,000. So we also called out the negative additional impacts. We had a planned turnaround in Angola, and then we also had some cyclones in Australia and some pretty severe weather in Kazakhstan through the quarter, so those were both negative. But offsetting those, we had turnarounds in the fourth quarter in both Trinidad and then in the Gulf of Mexico, we were installing the water injection module on Tahiti. So both of those were positive impacts for the quarter that kind of offset each other.\nKatherine Lucas Minyard: Okay, got it, that's clear. And then just one other question on the -- just looking at the tax rate, was there anything about the geographic distribution of the overlift that resulted in maybe a variability in the tax rate? It looks like your tax rate was coming in just a little bit lower than what we would have previously modeled. So is there anything about the mix shift based on the overlift that might have driven that? Or is this kind of the right run rate, kind of all else equal?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Actually, our tax rate came in for the quarter at about a 46% rate, and it's a little higher than we have seen here. And what we really had is just jurisdictional mix effect between -- within international operations as well as within the Downstream. In the Downstream, too, we also had the asset sales, and those came through with essentially a very low effective tax rates. And so by default, that, in fact, makes our overall worldwide income more internationally Upstream-oriented here from a tax rate standpoint, and so that tends to boost the number. If you look forward, I would say our best guidance would be in the mid-40% range on a go-forward basis for us.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Allen Good of Morningstar.\nAllen Good: I just had a couple of questions surrounding your comments on domestic drilling and the preference for liquids over dry gas. Was that in reference just sort of drilling activity or were you referring as well to acreage additions? And if so was there any acreage additions in the first quarter that would be material compared to what the -- I guess, the acreage breakout you gave us during the Analyst Day that would have changed in those allocations significantly?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. We haven't had any material acreage additions here in the first quarter. So what we provided back in March is the latest update that we have there. And I was really talking about drilling activity and our focus on production and trying to ensure that we are value-focused in our production efforts and our drilling efforts.\nAllen Good: So as far as acreage additions and I don't even want to go as far as saying maybe potentially acquisitions, but as far as dry gas, I mean, is there any more interest here given the level of prices and potential attractiveness of assets? Or is that just something that's completely off the table at this point?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I don't think we want to -- I don't think we ever take anything off the table. I think we're -- I just would emphasize our value approach here. And if there is a combination of opportunity where we can see value down the line, then that's something that we would take a look at, but it has to be able to compete in our portfolio. We've got a very strong portfolio and so the hurdle is already very high for any sort of additions to it.\nAllen Good: Okay, and then can you just give us an update on the Downstream assets that were currently being marketed, if there's any sort of progress there or there's any additions to the list that you provided about a month ago as far as what you're looking at to dispose of?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, no additions to the list. The real changes that have happened we called out with Spain and the Envirofuels in Canada and then also the Perth Amboy terminal, but nothing additional other than what Mark presented at the Security Analyst Meeting.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, thank you. I think that's kind of run through the queue here. So I'd like to close off here. Let me just say that I appreciate everybody's participation on the call, and in particular, your interest in Chevron. I want to thank all of the analysts for putting your questions forward because it helps everybody's understanding of the company. Thank you very much, everyone. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes Chevron's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}], "2014": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2013, "date": "2014-01-31 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you, Jonathan and welcome to everyone to Chevron\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Chief Financial Officer and Jeff Gustavson, who is our General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the detailed cautionary statement on Slide 2. Turning to Slide 3, I want to begin by highlighting some of our strategic accomplishments for the year. We had our lowest ever days away from work rate continuing our improvement over several years now. We\u2019ve been the industry leader on this metric since 2010. Our financial performance in 2013 was solid. Once competition results are fully analyzed we expect to once again post the highest upstream cash and earnings margins per barrel compared to a broad set of peer competitors. Our strong cash flows and balance sheet allowed us to fund our capital program and capture new resource opportunities while maintaining competitive shareholder distributions. In our downstream business we started commercial operations of a 53,000 barrel per day vacuum gas oil FCC unit at the 50% owned Yeosu Refinery in South Korea. We made significant progress on the construction of a 25,000 barrel per day premium base oil plant at the Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery here in the U.S. We expect to reach mechanical completions toward the end of the first quarter and we will then ramp-up to full capacity during the second quarter. In addition, we\u2019ve also advanced our Oronite expansion project in Singapore. Our CPChem affiliate, our 50% owned chemicals joint venture announced final investment decision on a $6 billion US Gulf Coast Petrochemical project. In our upstream business we achieved startup and first shipment from Angola LNG, production began at the Papa-Terra project in Brazil; we also start up North Rankin-2 in Australia, which maintains production capacity at the North West Shelf LNG project. We made substantial progress on our major capital projects at the end of January. Gorgon is currently about 76% complete while Wheatstone is about 27% complete. Similar to prior quarters we have posted a number of photos highlighting our construction projects on these two important facilities on our Chevron Investor webpage located at chevron.com. We also continued construction activities for our projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Jack/St. Malo is now moored at its offshore location and is on schedule for startup later this year. Big Foot is expected to be towed to location in the third quarter with expected startup next year. We reached final investment decision for the Alder developments in the U.K. North Sea as well as for Moho Nord in the Republic of the Congo. We had a very busy year from a resource capture standpoint, successfully acquiring an interest in a discovered resource opportunity in Argentina to develop and explore the Vaca Muerta Shale and we also closed our entry into the Kitimat LNG project in Western Canada where the resources will come from new positions in the Horn River and Liard basins. We acquired additional shale and tight resource acreage in the Cooper Basin in Australia and the Duvernay Basin in Canada, the Permian Basin in the U.S. as well as in the Ukraine. We also grew our exploration portfolio by acquiring positions in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Australia, Brazil, Morocco, and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Our one year reserve replacement was 85%, bringing our three year replacement ratio to 123%. We are proud of our performance this past year. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Pat, who will take you through the financial results, Pat?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Hi, thank you John. Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were $4.9 billion or $2.57 per diluted share. For the year earnings were $21.4 billion, this equates to $11.09 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the year was 13.5% and our debt ratio at year end was 12%. 2013 marks our 26th consecutive annual dividend increase with 11% growth in the quarterly rate. This demonstrates our confidence in our future performance and is consistent with our priority of rewarding shareholders with sustained and strong dividend growth. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares, bringing the full year share repurchase total to $5 billion. In the first quarter of 2014, we expect to repurchase the same amount. Finally, Chevron\u2019s 2013 total shareholder return was 19.2%. We continue to lead our peer group on total shareholder returns for the three year, five year and ten year period. Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $10.5 billion during the fourth quarter; this was the strongest cash generation quarter of the year. For the full year, cash from operations totaled $35 billion reflecting the continued cash generating strength of our portfolio. Cash capital expenditures were $11.6 billion during the quarter and $38 billion for the full year. We had a very successful year on our resource acquisition efforts as John just mentioned. At year-end our cash balances totaled $16.5 billion giving us a net debt position of $4 billion. The Company continues to move towards a more traditional capital structure. Turning to Slide 6, I\u2019ll compare results for the fourth quarter 2013 with the third quarter 2013, as a reminder our earnings release compares fourth quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year-ago. Fourth quarter earnings were $4.9 billion, $20 million lower than the third quarter results. Upstream earnings were down $240 million, reflecting lower liquids realizations and higher exploration and operating expenses. Partially offsetting were favorable foreign exchange movements of $490 million. Downstream results edged up $10 million between quarters, higher margins and favorable inventory effects were mostly offset by the absence of gains on asset transactions and higher operating expenses. The variance in the other bar largely reflects the favorable swing in corporate tax items during the quarter. On Slide 7, our U.S. upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were $223 million lower than third quarter\u2019s results. Lower realization decreased earnings by $165 million consistent with the decline in U.S. crude oil price indicators. Lower production volumes reduced earnings by $35 million mainly due to planned maintenance activity in the Gulf of Mexico and cold weather disruptions in the Mid-Continent region. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including higher operating expenses and unfavorable tax impact partially offset by lower exploration and DD&A expenses. Turning to Slide 8, international upstream results were just $17 million lower than last quarter\u2019s results. Realizations decreased earnings by $60 million consistent with the decline in Brent prices between quarters. Higher exploration expenses mainly driven by the write-off of an exploration well offshore Canada and higher geological and geophysical expenses across multiple areas decreased earnings by $190 million. A combination of higher operating expenses and DD&A lowered earnings $150 million between periods. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including the absence of asset sale gains and favorable tax effects from the prior quarter. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects increased earnings by $490 million. The fourth quarter had a gain of about $300 million compared to a loss of about $190 million in the third quarter. Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Production declined 9,000 barrels a day between quarters. Our shale and tight assets contributed 7,000 barrels a day, mainly from new production in the Marcellus region in the U.S. and Vaca Muerta in Argentina. External constraints lowered fourth quarter production by 12,000 barrels a day, reflecting lower demand in Thailand and in Bangladesh, as well as weather-related disruptions in the U.S. The base business and other bar include the impact of normal field declines, which are partially offset by higher production from Agbami in Nigeria. Slide 10 compares full year 2013 net oil-equivalent production to that of 2012. Production declined by 13,000 barrels per day in 2013. Production averaged 2.6 million barrels per day for the year, 98% of our original guidance. This is driven primarily by the slower ramp up at Angola LNG, more expensive turnaround activities and lower gas demand than anticipated in several countries. Base business declines and asset sales reduced production by 49,000 barrels per day between years. Our base business operation delivered strong performance for 2013. Our base decline rate was lower than our target of 4% providing significant barrels and value. Growing volumes from our shale and tight resources in the Permian and in the Marcellus regions in the U.S. contributed 25,000 barrels per day. Our shale and tight production grew more than 15% in 2013. Incremental production from our major capital projects contributed 11,000 barrels per day driven by the Angola LNG startup, First Oil from Papa-Terra in Brazil and the ramp up of production at the Usan field in Nigeria. Turning now to Slide 11, U.S. downstream results were up $16 million between periods. Stronger margins increased earnings by $95 million, mainly due to lower crude costs. West Coast refining margins also benefited from the completion of plant maintenance activity in the third quarter at our El Segundo, California refinery. Gains on asset sales contributed about $90 million less in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items of smaller impact. On Slide 12, international downstream earnings were nearly flat between quarters. Margins improved earnings by $20 million. Higher refining margins in Canada on lower crude cost and improved marketing margins in Australia were partially offset by lower refining margins in Asia, where we\u2019ve seen weaker demand and ample supply. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $60 million principally for maintenance, repairs and transportation. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items including favorable year-end LIFO impact partially offset by lower trading results and an unfavorable swing in foreign exchange impact. Slide 13, covers all other, fourth quarter net charges were $312 million, compared to $522 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $210 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $162 million benefit to earnings while corporate costs were $48 million lower this quarter. For the full year, this segment had net charges of $1.6 billion, putting us in the lower end of our $400 million to $500 million guidance range per quarter. We believe this quarterly guidance range for the all other segment is still appropriate going forward. With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to John for a few comments on 2014. John?\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 14, in December you recall we announced a $39.8 billion capital program for 2014, $2 billion lower than 2013. We expect 2013 to be a relative peak spending year, and 2014 to represent the peak year for LNG spend as our two Australian LNG projects move closer to production. This program also supports our large deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments as well as ongoing development and ramp up activities in the Permian Basin in the U.S. We\u2019re also investing in longer term projects in Kazakhstan, Canada and West Africa which will drive profitable growth for many years. Importantly, planned spending is directed towards our profitable base business assets throughout the world and well, this includes significant activity across several producing regions in North America as well as in Thailand and Indonesia, amongst others. Our downstream investments for 2014 are geared toward enhancing reliability and energy efficiency, feedstock flexibility and the production of cleaner transportation fuels. We\u2019re also funding major capital projects related to our chemicals business. Our Oronite expansion project in Singapore is planned to startup in 2014 and we\u2019ll begin ramping up construction activities on the U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project which recently reached FID and is planned to startup in 2017. We have an attractive portfolio of investment opportunities, which will continue to fund in a disciplined fashion to grow enterprise value and fund shareholder distributions. On Slide 15, our net production outlook for 2014 is 2.61 million barrels oil equivalent per day based on average Brent price of $109 per barrel, which was the same average price as 2013. This outlook does not assume OPEC curtailments, material and security or other market impacts. Our full year estimate for 2014 includes modest production ramp-ups at Angola LNG, Papa-Terra and in the Permian Basin. These are expected to be partially offset by declines from our base producing assets, where we continue to assume an average decline rate of approximately 4%. Our focus is on managing the decline rate related to our base business, which is performing very well and on executing with excellence those developments which are expected to add material production volumes in the years ahead. Our long-term production growth outlook is compelling, profitable and will add value. It is driven by five large projects; Angola LNG, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot, Gorgon and Wheatstone, which in total will add over 500,000 barrels per day of net new production to Chevron at full capacity. In 2015, we\u2019ll see the start-up of Gorgon and Big Foot and additional ram up of Jack/St. Malo. We look forward to providing more details on our key projects and production outlook at our upcoming Security Analyst Meeting. Thank you. That concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. We\u2019re ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue. So please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. I will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from ISI Group. Your question please.\nDoug Terreson: Good morning, everybody.\nJohn S. Watson: Hey, Doug.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nDoug Terreson: My question is about capital discipline and specifically the decline in returns on capital to around 14%, which I think places that result at its lowest level in many years. And on this point, John, you talked about the importance of value creation, and you always do actually, but also making hard choices in capital allocation when you were in New York recently. And so while I recognize that you have to complete investment in these megaprojects, I want to see what the Company is doing to address this issue from a corporate planning perspective, or whatever you deem relevant to ensure that this value creation process is optimized.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. Good question, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: We did enough capital program as I said of $39.8 billion. It\u2019s a significant program and it largely reflects the good queue that we have. When I reflect on our company and our capital discipline you know we have a wide lead in profit per barrels, some $5 a barrel, not just over the majors, but over independents and others. So we have had discipline over the years and the projects that we have in the queue, we think will also add to earnings going forward. Now it\u2019s true that the cycle time for some of the projects that I mentioned those big five that I mentioned is long and so there is capital that is not yet on production in the queue. Notwithstanding that, we actually expect our upstream business to have the second highest return on capital employed this year despite that high level of pre-productive capital. So I think we\u2019ve got good discipline on these projects. We got a good record of doing it. Now inside the company we\u2019re cognizant that there has been a significant increase in the cost of goods and services across the industry. Since the middle of last decade costs have more than doubled and there is some hotspots around the world. So we\u2019re looking very closely at the projects that are in our portfolio. Naturally we\u2019re going to continue with the projects that are under construction, but you\u2019ve seen a couple of areas where we have made some choices. The Rosebank project in the North Sea, we think that\u2019s a good project, a good resource, but cost came in just higher than what we felt were appropriate. So we\u2019re taking a hard look at that project, reviewing it, seeing if we can make the economics more attractive. The Vietnam gas project, we worked \u2013 we and frankly Unocal before us worked for more than a decade to try to make that project a success, haven\u2019t been able to do that just yet. So I think that we\u2019re really doing what we can. I\u2019d tell you also in the U.S. we\u2019ve scaled back our spending on gas as you might expect. So the volume that you\u2019ll see from gas in the U.S. will be less than we might have planned a few years ago. The only area where we\u2019re spending on gas in any appreciable amount is in the Marcellus where we have a carry that enables us to continue to spend. So all of those things plus outreach that our employees are making with vendors and contractors and frankly just belt-tightening in general, which is a big focus for us right now and will be a message that I\u2019ll be sending in my worldwide conference call with employees in a couple of weeks, are the kinds of things that we\u2019re working on.\nDoug Terreson: Okay, those are all great points. And so let me just ask one more. So have you guys quantified what your level of pre-productive capital is, however you guys define it, and how that compares to normal today, John?\nJohn S. Watson: We do and I\u2019ll make you a promise that Pat Yarrington will show you a fair amount of information on that when we come back in March. But, Doug, it\u2019s at a high level right now.\nDoug Terreson: Sure. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, guys. If I could take one and my follow-up please.\nJohn S. Watson: I can\u2019t hear you, Doug.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Doug, you've cut out.\nDoug Leggate: Hi. Can you hear me now?\nJohn S. Watson: If you speak up.\nDoug Leggate: Yes, I will try and speak up, sorry. So John, your production trajectory for 2014 I think has taken some folks by surprise in terms of the \u2013 [the price is] [ph] basically flat year-over-year. Has something slipped or changed there or are Street expectations just wrong or can you basically give us an idea when you expect the inflection point in production? And I've got a follow-up, please.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. As I indicated, our production guidance for 2014 is 2.61 and really there\u2019s couple of things to talk about. One, our base business has been performing very well. So we\u2019re continuing to invest in the base and frankly we\u2019ve seen some declines that are less than we\u2019d expect, but we do use our standard 4% decline estimate for the base business, the underlying business for 2014. Beyond that it\u2019s a function of ramp-ups that we have on major capital projects and there are really a couple that fall into that category. One is Angola LNG and the other is Papa-Terra in Brazil that Petrobras operates. We\u2019ve got a couple of wells on in Papa-Terra, but the ramp-up takes place. It\u2019s really a two-part project that will take place over the course of this year and we take operator guidance in setting that estimate. Angola LNG ramp-up is less than we would have expected a couple of years ago and this might be a good time for me to talk about that project. Our share of production from Angola LNG is 60,000 barrels a day net at full capacity. We\u2019ve had about five cargoes last year. I think we've had a couple that we've lifted this year, but we\u2019ve been working on some technical issues on the front-end of the plant with the dehydration unit. Remember this is an associated gas project, meaning there is variable feed coming from different facilities. We\u2019ve had some technical issues on the front-end of that plant. And so our expectation is it will not ramp up to full capacity this year. It will likely be more like 30,000 barrels a day if we run it about half capacity this year with the full fix in the first part of 2015 and then ramp up to full capacity after that. So that is probably one of the factors that might be influencing the estimates that are out there. Beyond that we\u2019ve got Jack/St. Malo which we\u2019re very pleased with, which we\u2019ll be starting up late in the year. Obviously you only get a partial year\u2019s production from a later in the year start up, but that will start up nicely. So I think it\u2019s more likely that the inflection point will come next year than this year. I don't think that\u2019s inconsistent with the guidance that we gave. If you go back to 2010, in the sense that we said that we would grow roughly 1% between 2010 and 2014 and then 4% to 5% a year thereafter ramping up to our larger target. But understanding the performance of LNG has impacted 2014 to be sure.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks for the answer, John. My follow-up very quickly to Pat is, a move to a normal balance sheet structure, Pat, it looks to us that your cash burn is about $10 billion a year. Is it realistic that you add $30 billion by the \u2013 to your balance sheet by the time you hit your targets in 2017? And I will leave it there. Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Doug, that will all be a function really of what realizations are, what\u2019s happening from the crude market standpoint fundamentally. But I mean, if you assume no significant change from where we are today from a realization standpoint and acknowledge what the production growth will look like and what cash from operations could look like, we would expect to add additional borrowings to our balance sheet of reasonable size over the next couple of years. So we are starting with a very low leverage rate, 12% right now and there\u2019s a lot of capacity that we can utilize to not only fund the business activity, reinvest in the business, but also continue on with strong shareholder distributions.\nJohn S. Watson: Let me offer a couple other comments, if I could on that one. Our cash C&E this last year in 2013 was about $39 billion. That included some acquisitions. We expect fewer this year and the cash spend is about $35 billion this year. In addition, asset sales were relatively low last year. We expect modestly higher asset sales going forward. We\u2019re doing some rationalizing in the midstream business, part of the ordinary course of business and we have a few things we\u2019re looking at in the upstream portfolio. Remember most of the cash drain you\u2019re referring to is planned orderly to restore balance sheet back to a more leveraged structure and is largely a function of share repurchases that we're putting in place. Our intention as we start ramping up production of course is to get to a point where we not only cover C&E, but also cover the dividend. Our policy on dividend has been to grow that dividend commensurate with the ongoing pattern of earnings and cash flow over the long-term. So we\u2019re in this period where we have relatively high spend. We\u2019re generating good cash, but we expect cash generation to increase and as we go forward we expect the cash consumption to attenuate as we roll into higher levels of production.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. I appreciate the answers.\nJohn S. Watson: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.\nEd G. Westlake: Yes. Good morning and thanks for your time. Just coming more I guess back to the U.S. I mean your CapEx in the upstream and your outlook is sort of relatively flat. I mean I appreciate there are some really big projects in the Gulf of Mexico. But you have this emerging shale position not just in the U.S., also obviously up in Canada. Maybe talk about why you are not getting after that more aggressively? I actually saw some really good well results from you guys down in the Permian this morning?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, you want us to spend more Ed?\nEd G. Westlake: In that area potentially, but what stops you or\u2026?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, a couple of facts. I don't know what, we\u2019ve got a couple of different shale plays going on in Canada. One is in Duvernay, which is liquids oriented and we\u2019ve drilled it. I think we\u2019re on our 13th well up there and have had some good success and we are looking to develop that at a good pace. Our approach to the shale is to make sure we understand what we got and to plan in orderly fashion so that we can keep cost in line commensurate with the production that we can generate. So I do agree with you. We had some good results from those wells. The second of course is the Horn River and Liard Basin, which is gas to support the Kitimat project, which \u2013 well, there will be additional drilling in the Liard this year to delineate those holdings and of course that production would be associated over time with an LNG project at Kitimat.\nEd G. Westlake: And I was also referring to the Permian obviously where you have got a huge acreage position. It just feels that if that was in the hands of an independent they\u2019d be gung ho after it, whereas it feels that perhaps due to corporate CapEx constraints you guys or maybe delineation are going a little bit slower.\nJohn S. Watson: Well, I know that\u2019s what the independents tell you. What I would tell you is we work very hard to put together a really sustainable and capital-efficient plan over time. Having said that, we drilled some 460 gross wells in 2013, which is more than we had planned. We got 26 rigs working in the basins there. About half of those actually are non-op rigs as well as our own rigs. And I think you\u2019ll see that we are ramping up activity pretty nicely. In March George will show you some charts that will give you a better feel for that, but I think you\u2019ll see a nice ramp up both in the number of rigs and in production that will come from that area. Remember, one thing, we do try to be efficient with our capital. We are focused on making good returns and so we do want to be sure that we can do it in a low-cost fashion and do it in a way that will generate the kind of financial results overall that will keep us leading. I mentioned earlier that we lead in earnings per barrel relative to the majors, but we also have a big lead in return on capital and return per barrel relative to a lot of the independents as well. So we may not go as fast as some of the independents, but I think it\u2019s the right way for us to move forward.\nEd G. Westlake: Thanks, John.\nJohn S. Watson: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.\nPaul Cheng: Thanks. Good morning.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nPaul Cheng: John and Pat, maybe I have two questions, both of them is somewhat higher level. One is from a capital allocation standpoint. Obviously the last several years, the Company has been going after a lot of the legacy long-term megaprojects, which is great once that they compete. But from a portfolio management standpoint is there a point that you want to say maybe balance the portfolio a little bit between whether from a production standpoint or capital standpoint between the megaprojects, which obviously have a higher risk in terms of the underlying execution and also somewhat binary in nature comparing to a more steady maybe shorter-term projects? That\u2019s the first question.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay. Well, certainly we do quite a bit of work, Paul, on portfolio management to do just as you described. In fact, we tried to balance the portfolio in many ways, but certainly one is the balance between the investments in long-term projects and short-term money. We consciously took on some projects that we felt were opportunistic and ready to go with Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot. And so, we knew that we had a heavy period of spend for those projects, but at the same time we\u2019ve really maintained a very strong base business spend program. About 30% of our spend goes into smaller capital projects and you make a good point because I just, for example, just happen to review our performance on small capital projects within the last couple of weeks and the returns are quite good. These are typically incremental projects, incremental drilling projects to existing assets. And so, we do maintain that spend. In fact the discretionary spend that we have is in that area and we have announced the strong capital program for 2014, and my alternative was largely to cut those base business spend and we decided not to do that. So we tried to balance both those factors so that we get strong returns on capital over time and get good growth and we\u2019ve been able to do that. Despite all the capital that\u2019s in the queue we still, from the numbers that we have, we think we\u2019ll maintain our second position on return on capital employed.\nPaul Cheng: John, on [indiscernible] is there a ratio over the next five or 10 years that you want to have 50% of the capital on the legacy megaproject and 50% on the smaller and the base business? Or there is not even a ratio that you guys consider or look at?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, we will have a higher \u2013 I think we\u2019ve advertised before that we are moving toward a higher percentage of legacy, what we call, legacy or very low declining project, so that as we get toward the end of the decade we\u2019ll be at about 60%. So things like Gorgon, Wheatstone, Tengiz, Angola LNG and the like, even some of our low decline assets such as California heavy oil activity is very low decline and we\u2019re moving to a higher level. The plus side of that is as you get those on line the amount of spend that it takes to maintain them tends to be fairly low. So we are moving to a higher level of what you\u2019d call legacy spend projects and I think they will deliver a lot of cash and stability for years to come once we get them all on line.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. The second question is that over the last couple years that you have been borrowing \u2013 or actually now since you have been borrowing money to fund a buyback, and as the balance sheet return to more normal, at what point, what would you say, fixed financial ways such as net debt to capital or interest cap [ph] ratio the company will start to reconsider the buyback whether or that you would continue to borrow money to fund it?\nJohn S. Watson: I\u2019ll let Pat talk a little bit about our philosophy on debt and the rating agencies and how much capacity we\u2019ve got.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. And Paul, we said for a long time now that obviously from a cash distribution standpoint the priority is on dividend. Secondly, we invest in the business and cover up the strength of our balance sheet from a pension funding standpoint and that kind of thing, so the third priority. And then finally, it\u2019s share repurchases that become kind of the surplus use of cash and we have also said several times here now that we were in an unusual net cash position for several years now. We will be moving into a net debt position. We have now done that. As I look forward we still have a tremendous amount of borrowing capacity available to us. We believe that we\u2019re very confident in the future cash generation from these projects once they come on line. And so we can see our steady state here from a share distribution standpoint on share repurchases for a while. We also see intensions to continue to grow the dividend. We have a lot of flexibility in our balance sheet and I don\u2019t think that there is a consideration at least in terms of steady macro condition that would suggest that we would be turning our share repurchases at this time.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nEvan Calio: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nJohn S. Watson: Hey, Evan.\nEvan Calio: John, on the CapEx, I know that the organic cash CapEx exceeded your guidance by about $2 billion. As you assess that 2014 CapEx budget what gives you confidence that you won\u2019t experience similar inflation? I mean, is there anything different, any protections, conservatisms versus what happened as you \u2013 versus how you asses 2014? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: Our number \u2013 taking out the money for acquisitions that we had last year, the amount that went over the budget I think was lower than that. So I don\u2019t know that we disclosed the exact dollars of those acquisitions, but it\u2019s somewhat lower than that. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be having the conversation about capital had we not had those one-time acquisitions. But candidly, if we have a supplement to a project we\u2019re going to fund it in that year. In general we manage our budget pretty tightly and I have no reason to believe at this point that we\u2019ll exceed the $39.8 billion that we put out there. We\u2019re sensitive to it, you\u2019re sensitive to it. So we will be watching it very closely.\nEvan Calio: Similar and maybe this is something for the Analyst Day. As obviously organic CapEx, cash CapEx trend here is flat and you mentioned a peak LNG spend in 2014. There are a lot of your peers that are forecasting a peak CapEx. So do you see a similar overall trend based upon your current slate of projects? And then maybe secondly, this is the other side of the question. It\u2019s unclear what the world looks like in two, three, five years let alone the opportunities in the asset market, M&A market, resource market, et cetera. I mean do you see any real ability to forecast a longer-term CapEx figure? And I will leave it at that.\nJohn S. Watson: Well, it\u2019s a good question. One of the reasons \u2013 and I\u2019ve told you and others before, one of the reasons we haven\u2019t put out long-term capital forecast is because it\u2019s very hard to predict oil prices, foreign exchange, local content requirements, cost of goods and services. What we have been fairly good at understanding is the competitive nature of our project. So when we put out long-term production forecast we\u2019ve had a view that \u2013 we know the world is going to need energy, we know that we got projects that will compete because of the resource and general nature of the project. And so, we\u2019ve been \u2013 frankly we stepped out quite a bit in putting out a seven-year production forecast and I feel pretty good about that. It was harder to predict what the exact spend would be. And that\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019ve been reticent to give a lot of guidance going out beyond two or three years. I know directionally the level of our activity and we do balance that, but I don't know what the macro environment will bring fully. And once we get projects that are under construction we\u2019re obviously going to continue them. So I have a pretty good feel obviously for what spending will be this year and I have a pretty good feel for what spend is going to be in 2015 and 2016 and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve given you this flattening comment where $40 billion this year will be in that same range give or take for the next couple of years. Beyond that the macro conditions could dictate something different. We do try to be opportunistic when it comes to bringing resources into the portfolio. Last year, I think we brought in some terrific resources into our portfolio at a good price. As you know, we supplemented our acreage in New Mexico in the Permian area. We brought in some good high-quality assets that we referenced earlier in the Duvernay. We think the Kitimat resource is a terrific one for the long-term. Argentina, as far as we know, it\u2019s the best shale outside of North America. So we took the opportunity to bring those into the portfolio and we don\u2019t see as many opportunities in that space this year, for example. That\u2019s why I made the comment I did earlier about spend, but over time we are in depleting resource business and you do need to add to the portfolio. We\u2019re careful how we do that. That\u2019s how we got to our leading position in earnings per barrel and we\u2019ll continue to be careful in how we do that going forward.\nEvan Calio: Maybe I could slip in just one last one on the asset disposal side. I know you mentioned in a response or your comments the midstream sale process monetization. I mean any update or any change in your thoughts there given you\u2019re growing unconventional base and a likely associated midstream CapEx over time? Any change or whether that would be an outright sale or potentially forming an MLP? And I will leave it at that.\nJohn S. Watson: Yes. In fact I will say there is a little bit of a shift. Let me be clear. We\u2019re not in shrink to grow mode, we\u2019re not resetting the base, we\u2019re not doing anything like that. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing. But just as we\u2019ve done in the downstream, where we pruned the portfolio, I think Mike and his team has sold some $8 billion in assets over the last six, seven years and those have been done in a very nice pace way to get good value. We\u2019re in the process right now of making some sales in our midstream business for example. You referenced MLPs, our approach \u2013 we\u2019re not fond of the MLP structure as a way for us to hold assets, but we can sell into MLPs and get that value. And so we have been selling pipelines and we\u2019ll continue to do so for pipelines where they\u2019re not critical to our upstream or downstream business, n other words more merchant type lines. We are selling lines. You\u2019ve probably seen some commentary in the press to do that. We think we can get good value there. Similarly, we do have a lifecycle for asset sales in the upstream and so there are some sales that are possible there. Our approach is not to talk a lot about the specific assets for commercial reasons, but I would say you\u2019ll see more asset sale activity over the next two or three years in the upstream than you\u2019ve seen over the last few years. Certainly there\u2019s been a lot of chatter about some leases that we\u2019re selling in Nigeria. Those we think will bring to a closure later this year and get good value for those. And I would say overall in the context of some of the big headline numbers others have said, our sales will be modest. But we will have a little bit more in the area of asset sales going forward.\nEvan Calio: Appreciate. Thanks, guys.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.\nPavel S. Molchanov: Thanks very much for taking the question. You mentioned the ongoing reduction in domestic gas drilling and yet ironically that\u2019s the one part of your domestic production that\u2019s actually been up for the last, I guess three, four quarters. Why do you think there is this disparity where domestic gas is rising, but oil and liquids have been in decline?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, the only \u2013 the area where we\u2019ve been investing in the U.S. has been in the Marcellus and it\u2019s a function of the carry. So the volume increases that you are seeing, you recall we acquired Atlas Energy and some other tuck-on and we came in with $1.3 billion carry where one as we go forward we\u2019re funding a disproportionately low percentage of the cost for the revenue that we\u2019re getting. That carry is now down to $500 million. And our strategy has been to really build up a factory model, get our full costs in line so that as we end that carry three or four years from now that we\u2019ll be in a good competitive position on a cost per MCF basis once we get through that carry. In the meantime, we can afford to do the drilling. We obviously \u2013 wells that are drilled when you are funding 25% of the cost and getting 60% of revenue, I think that the ratio is pretty good.\nPavel S. Molchanov: Sure. And then a follow up on Kitimat, I think you\u2019ve said in the past year your aim is to reach FID this year. Is that still the case and what are the key question marks that would impede that from happening?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, we're doing site clearance now. One of the things we\u2019ve learned on big land-based projects is get your infrastructure in order and housing and things of that sort. So that's what we are doing. We are pacing this project very carefully as you would expect and what we have said is that FID will be entirely a function of gas contracts and that allow us to develop the opportunity and provide energy to Asian markets at a fair price. And it's no secret that there is a lot in the media on that subject right now. We are actively working with gas customers today. My view hasn't changed since the view Joe Geagea described to you last year, which is LNG projects are expensive whether in West Canada, West Africa or East Africa or the Gulf Coast of the U.S. or Australia. And we're going to need robust pricing in order to make those project go, and so there are some projects that may be built on existing facilities in the Gulf Coast of the U.S. that have gone to FID and we\u2019ll add some capacity that may be slightly lower cost. But once you get to Brownfield, whether it\u2019s Gulf Coast or elsewhere, I think we're going to need either oil link pricing or pricing that very clearly will give us the kind of return we need. So I guess what I am saying is FID will be a function of gas contracts.\nPavel S. Molchanov: All right. I appreciate it.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allen Good from Morningstar. Your question, please.\nAllen Good: Good morning, everyone.\nJohn S. Watson: Good morning.\nAllen Good: John, you mentioned a little bit on the Downstream sales and restructuring. Just a question on that. Is that business currently sized right for Chevron and do you see any other opportunity there to potentially reduce capital employed on the downtown side?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, our downstream business if you look at the direction we\u2019ve gone, we actually have done quite a bit of pruning over the last two years. We\u2019ve basically gotten out of the disconnected marketing or marketing is disconnected from our refining system and then we did get out of our refinery in Europe that we think was very well timed. And so what\u2019s that left us with is a strong U.S. business with good positions along the Gulf Coast and through the West Coast of the U.S, and then a strong business in Asia. We think \u2013 we always take a look at the portfolio, but in general, I think our Downstream portfolio is in pretty good shape. I might have told you a few years ago that inland refineries, small refineries would be tough, but frankly those have been some of the most profitable with the one in Salt Lake and Burnaby, British Columbia. So I feel pretty good about the portfolio overall in the Downstream. The capital that we are putting in the Downstream business is really geared towards the chemicals business now. We\u2019ve got a base oil plant that\u2019s coming up in Pascagoula that will make us the largest top tier base oil producer in the world. We\u2019ve got our share of the petrochemical complex that we're building with Phillips 66 through Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, that\u2019s a $6 billion project. Our share is $3 billion. We think that is going to be a terrific project. As far as we know we are ahead of other projects in the area. We have got the permits and have gone to FID. Overall, we think we can generate mid-teens kinds of returns in this business and so we think it is a good one.\nAllen Good: Yes, I guess on the chemicals, I mean you mentioned a product upcoming and certainly that is a very good portfolio there. But I guess relative to the size of Chevron total it's still relatively a small piece. Do you think the market is accurately crediting you for that business? And if not, do you think there is way potentially to monetize that through \u2013 I don\u2019t know as with Phillips 66 or spinning that off separately or is your plan really just to hold out for the long-term and then continue to build that up?\nJohn S. Watson: Our plan is to hold that. It\u2019s about 15% of our capital. We disclosed the segment information. I think you guys have sharp enough pencils to be able to figure out what it brings to us. But more importantly the math there is some linkages in the business that I think are very important. I don't think splitting up the business makes you an independent. We have some very significant linkages to the downstream business, and I\u2019ll give you just a couple just as for instance. Southern California, our El Segundo Refinery, we\u2019ve got heavy crude going out of San Joaquin Valley. We\u2019ve just augmented some facilities at the El Segundo Refinery specifically so it can take more San Joaquin Valley crude. We think that's a good synergistic type of investment. Over the years we've had high mercury crude in Asia and we\u2019ve put in specific facilities to be able to capture value benefit associated with that. I think when you look in the middle of the country today I think it makes all the sense in the world to be an integrated company. You\u2019ve had tremendous volatility in crude pricing and you\u2019re either capturing the refinery or you\u2019re capturing on the upstream side, just depending upon how infrastructure moves and we\u2019re capturing that in Salt Lake. So I frankly think that the integration story for us is pretty straightforward.\nAllen Good: Okay. Great. Thanks for the comments.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nRoger D. Read: Yes. Good morning.\nJohn S. Watson: Good morning.\nRoger D. Read: I guess a lot of this stuff has been hit. I just wanted to kind of follow-up on, I guess, Q4 in the upstream in the U.S. and if that had any implications for how we should look forward, I understand on the production side as we modeled it. The realization for prices looked okay. I know as I went through the \u2013 or as you went through the presentation it showed realizations down. I was wondering is that a cost issue realization, sort of a net realization as opposed to just a price realization and if so, what kind of occurred in the fourth quarter, is that one-time issue or recurring issue? Any help you can provide there.\nJeff Gustavson: So Roger, I can help with that. This is Jeff. It's not a net realization. It's a price realization and it was consistent with the markers that you see in the market for the fourth quarter.\nRoger D. Read: Okay. So I mean more or less what occurred in the fourth quarter we should look at as being an issue going forward, I mean as crude prices move around that will change, but just the market conditions.\nJeff Gustavson: That's exactly right.\nRoger D. Read: Okay. And then as we look forward into 2014, especially at the end of the year, say, Jack/St. Malo starts up, you got continued growth probably in California. Should we look at that as helping out the realization story in the U.S., North America?\nJeff Gustavson: Again I guess it depends on your view of prices. So we are out of our U.S. production, we're about a third weighted to California prices, which is obviously separate from what\u2019s going on in the mid-continent. We\u2019re about a quarter weighted to Mid-continent or WTI prices and about a third weighted to the Gulf of Mexico. So I mean as Jack/St. Malo comes on, as Big Foot comes on, the weighting in the Gulf of Mexico may increase somewhat. There's not a lot of growth in the California business and at the same time we have the ramp-up in the Permian. So it really goes back to what your view of the different markers are in those three separate regions.\nRoger D. Read: Sure. Okay. That's helpful. And then, any additional update you can provide as you look at the Vaca Muerta kind of the drilling plans 2014 and 2015, when would we potentially see anything on the production side. I know you made the comment it\u2019s a great shale. Just wondering when would we maybe see something tangible that we can start to fix on?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, I think you\u2019ll start to see it going forward from here. We\u2019re producing 16,000 barrels a day gross. That\u2019s 100% number. And so, one of the reasons I made the comment about it being a good investment is there\u2019s lots of oil infrastructure there now. So it\u2019s right in the middle of an oil producing area. YPF is doing a nice job. We\u2019re sending in some technical and other people to support them, but we got 15 rigs running. We think over time that it will get up to 19 and so we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll see continued growth. I\u2019ll just say we just recently closed the transaction. So it\u2019s very early days at this point, but it\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s probably more to come, but you should start to see benefits in production here before too long.\nRoger D. Read: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn S. Watson: All right. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Hutton from RBC Capital Markets.\nPeter Hutton: Good morning. Good afternoon from London. Actually my first question is a follow-up from the last one, which is about these liquid realizations in the U.S. and you mentioned that these are in line with the benchmarks. Well, from what I can see when I follow the trend, that is right, when you\u2019re looking against the third quarter, but the third quarter have the highest discount between your average realization and WTI since the 2008 peak. So is it two quarters when we've had discounts of the order of something like $10 shortfall. And so I guess I'm asking the same question in a different way. Is that something we should also expect to see during the course of 2014 until you start to get more production out of the Gulf of Mexico from Jack/St. Malo? And then I had a follow-up which is actually my original question.\nJohn S. Watson: I don\u2019t know we got anything fundamental for you. Maybe right for Jeff to follow-up with you offline to see if there is something in the markers that we\u2019re not covering here, but there are some lags in pricing that take place in the U.S. But if you wouldn\u2019t mind, Peter, maybe we\u2019ll follow-up offline and see if we can get to those specifics.\nPeter Hutton: Be glad to. In that case can I just \u2013 the question I was going to ask originally, which is on the reserve replacement rate and exploration. I think you mentioned 85% this year, which is down on the full year and one year is not a trend. But were there any areas where you have been focusing and didn't come in the way that you had expected? And realistically sort of where the focus is for this year and can you give a figure of the budget for exploration spent in 2014? Please.\nJohn S. Watson: Yes, actually the irony, this is a very good year for reserve replacement relative to what we had in our plan because we have sort of base business type activity, infill drilling and the like, developments and additions, revisions off the existing field and we had a very good year in that area. What we didn\u2019t have was a significant number of major capital projects that went to FID and that\u2019s why this number tends to be lumpy in any given year. So, well, on an ongoing basis it was less than replacing 100% of production. That\u2019s why we quote the three year and five year numbers, which are 100% or higher. So I think that\u2019s really my thought for you on reserves. Exploration this year is about $3 billion to $3.2 billion type of number this year. I\u2019ll tell you one of the challenges we\u2019ve had last couple of years is getting all our high impact wells drilled. We\u2019ve got a great queue, but we frankly in the Gulf of Mexico we\u2019ve been drilling so many development wells that we got to queue that\u2019s built up there and so we\u2019re looking forward to, I think we\u2019ve got 14 or so high impact wells which we define as 100 million barrel or more prospects and we look forward to getting them drilled here over the next few years. But little over 3 billion is the target for the year. Thank you very much.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I think we have time for one more question?\nJohn S. Watson: One more question Robert.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Robert Kessler from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your question please.\nRobert Arthur Kessler: Hi, thanks for fitting me in and I look forward to the Analyst Day where I am sure we will go through more detail. But in the meantime I wanted to ask you for kind of an update on your Australia LNG cost and exposure to exchange rate. We still see volatility there. I know you are of course further through the spend on Gorgon at 76%, which would imply less exposure to the exchange rate on the surface. But I imagine more of the spend now is local labor, which I am assuming is priced in Australian dollars. So just the latest sort of leverage to that exchange rate if you don't mind and then any rethinking of your plans not to I guess hedge foreign exchange going forward?\nJohn S. Watson: Yes, interesting question. Maybe the comment I will make, we have had a rollercoaster on foreign exchange in Australia, as you point out. When we went to Final Investment Decision back in 2009, the exchange rate was roughly $0.86 and it ramped up as high I think 105 or so. And that was part of the reason that we supplemented the project. Our view at that time was not to hedge foreign exchange because we felt there have been a pretty strong correlation between oil prices and their currency and so we felt that our overall portfolio was pretty well hedged. And I think that proved to be a pretty wise decision. When we went to FID on Wheatstone, we did so and have assumed a parity exchange rate. So that\u2019s a $29 billion project when we assume parity. This year our spend on the two projects is roughly $10 billion and we estimate that 70%, 75% of that spend is in Australian dollar. So with the Australian dollar tracking under $0.90 now that\u2019s a positive for us going forward. We\u2019re out a little something on this, so we\u2019re benefiting from it right now and we don\u2019t do any hedging and I don\u2019t anticipate that we will going forward.\nRobert Arthur Kessler: Great. Nice to see it swing the other way and thanks for the update.\nJohn S. Watson: You bet, thank you. Okay, thank you all. In closing, let me say we appreciate everyone\u2019s participation today on the call. I would like to thank the analyst for asking the good questions in this morning session. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing you in March and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have lot more questions and we\u2019ll enjoy the material we\u2019ll be presenting then. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-11-01 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPat Yarrington: Hey thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Joe Geagea, Corporate Vice President and President, Gas and Midstream and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company\u2019s third quarter earnings were $5 billion, or $2.57 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 15%. Our debt ratio at the end of September was approximately 11%. In the third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the fourth quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount. Though not shown on the slide, I\u2019d like to call attention to our track record on shareholder returns. We are in first place on total shareholder returns for the three-year, five-year and 10-year periods compared to our peer group of global integrated energy companies. Turning to Slide 4, cash generated from operations was $10 billion during the third quarter and approximately $25 billion year-to-date. The third quarter was the strongest cash generation quarter this year. Adverse working capital effects noted earlier in the year continued to abate. Importantly, third quarter also saw stronger operating performance in both our Upstream and Downstream businesses. Capital and exploratory expenditures were $9.6 billion during the quarter and $26.4 billion year-to-date. I would like to make it clear that major resource acquisitions stemming from our business development activities are not included in our annual budget targets. We have found the success rate, timing and pricing for this effort to be too uncertain to effectively include in our annual budgeting and Board approval process for C&E. Because we have been very successful this year in our resource acquisition effort, taking up acreage and project opportunities in Canada, Australia and the Kurdistan region of Iraq, we anticipate we will close the year with C&E outlays above our planned levels. While there are still some large uncertainties on timing, we presently anticipate our 2013 C&E investments will be around 10% or still higher than our original target for the year. At quarter end, our cash balances exceeded $18 billion as total debt balances were identical in size, we ended the quarter in a neutral net cash, net debt position. Confirming what I\u2019ve said previously the company continues to move toward a more traditional net debt structure. Jeff will now take us through the quarterly comparison. Jeff?\nJeff Gustavson: Thanks Pat. Turning to slide five, all compared results for the third quarter 2013 with the second quarter of 2013. As a reminder our earnings release compares third quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter earnings were 5 billion about 400 million lower than second quarter results. Foreign exchange movements accounted for more than the overall decrease in earnings worth almost 600 million of the decline. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the second quarter and the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the third quarter caused a significant swing between the two periods. We moved from a net positive foreign exchange position in the second quarter of 300 million to a net negative position of nearly the same amount in the third quarter. Without this element our earnings performance this quarter would actually be better than the prior quarter. Upstream earnings were up 143 million reflecting higher liquids realizations and liftings mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Downstream results decreased 386 million between quarter\u2019s lower margins and unfavorable foreign exchange effects partly offset by higher volumes drove the decrease. The variance in the other bar largely reflects an unfavorable swing in corporate tax items during the quarter. On slide 6, our U.S. upstream earnings for the third quarter were 57 million lower than second quarter\u2019s results. Higher realizations increased earnings by 90 million driven largely by a rise in crude oil prices partially offset by the fall in natural gas prices. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by 30 million mainly due to maintenance activity in the Gulf of Mexico partly offset by higher production in the Permian. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including higher DD&A and higher exploration expenses. Turning to slide 7, international upstream earnings were 200 million higher than the second quarter. Higher realizations increased earnings by 430 million average liquids unit realizations increased by 11% consistent with the increase in average Brent spot prices between quarters. The timing of liftings across multiple countries increased earnings by $90 million. At the end of the quarter we were in a slightly over lifted position. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by 465 million. The third quarter had a loss of about 190 million compared to a gain of about 275 million in the second quarter. The other bar reflects a number of items favorable tax effects, gains on asset transactions and lower operating expenses were partially offset by higher exploration expenses. Slide 8, summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production increased 3000 barrels per day between quarters. New wells that are Agbami and Usan projects in Nigeria additional production from the Delaware basin in the Permian as well as volumes associated with Angola LNG increased net production by about 22,000 barrels per day. Plants maintenance activities decreased production by 14,000 barrels per day during the quarter most notably in the UK, Trinidad and Thailand with a partial offset from less maintenance activity in Australia. External constraints hurt third quarter production by 10,000 barrels per day primarily due to a mid-quarter lightning strike in Thailand which severely damaged and necessitated the shutdown of our customers gas processing plant. This in turn curtailed our Thai gas production. The base business in other bar includes the impact of normal field declines, cost recoveries and the impact of price effects on entitlement volumes. Production for the first three quarters of 2013 averaged just over 2.6 million barrels a day, below our initial full year production guidance of 2.65 million barrels per day. Several factors have affected our year-to-date production results, first Angola LNGs ramp-up of production has been slower than anticipated. Second turnaround activity across various locations has been more extensive than originally planned. Our final contributing factor relates to the damage of the gas plant in Thailand. We expect volumes to be higher in the fourth quarter as production is restored following maintenance related down-time during the third quarter and as new production comes online. For the full year, we expect to come in around 98% to 99% of our original production target. Turning to Slide 9. The U.S. downstream earnings improved by $111 million between periods, higher volumes increased earnings by $55 million primarily due to our Richmond, California refinery running at normal capacity for the full quarter. Lower refining and marketing margins decreased earnings by $95 million driven by rising crude cost. Reduced industry crack spreads also reflected improved supply conditions and higher plant utilization rates following the end of second quarter maintenance activity. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $30 million, primarily due to lower environmental charges. Greater gains on miscellaneous small asset sales improved earnings in the third quarter by $60 million. The chemicals and other variance, primarily reflects the absence of planned and unplanned downtime CPChem\u2019s Port Arthur and Sweeney plants in the second quarter. On Slide 10, International Downstream earnings increased by $497 million between quarters decreased by $497 million between quarters. Higher plant utilization rates boosted volumes and increased earnings by $30 million in the third quarter. Refining and marketing margins were lower by $220 million. Rising crude cost, continued soft product demand and oversupply in the Far East weakens industry crack spreads while price lag effects mainly for jet fuel and naphtha in Asia impacted marketing margins. Timing effects represented a $140 million negative earnings variance between quarters driven largely by the revaluation of inventory. The swing between quarters was primarily due to rising crude prices during the third quarter compared to falling crude prices during the second quarter. Foreign currency swings reduced earnings by about $115 million. Third quarter had a loss of approximately $85 million compared to a small gain of $30 million in the second quarter. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items including various tax items and higher shipping costs. Slide 11 covers all other. Third quarter net charges were $522 million compared to $350 million in the second quarter, an increase of $172 million between periods. Adverse corporate tax items resulted in a $219 million decrease to earnings between quarters. Our overall year-to-date effective tax rate at just around 40% is trending a little lower than in recent years. As you know, in any one period, this overall rate can be influenced by many factors including jurisdictional mix between Upstream and Downstream, jurisdictional mix within Upstream, foreign exchange and asset sales transactions. Corporate charges and other items were $47 million lower this quarter. Year-to-date net charges in the all other segment were $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $400 million to $500 million for the all other segment is still appropriate going forward. Joe is now going to provide an update on our LNG marketing activities. Joe?\nJoe Geagea: Thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone. I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the LNG market in our LNG portfolio. So turning to Slide 13, I will start by grinding you quickly on the global demand outlook for energy. The world\u2019s economy is growing driving increased demand for all forms of energy and much of this growth is in Asia, where people increasingly aspire for a better quality of life. And achieving this aspiration does require stable, secure and affordable energy supplies. Total world\u2019s energy demand as forecasted increased 30% by 2025 from today\u2019s level. Natural gas demand has projected to grow even more by about 40% by 2025. And LNG demand growth is expected to be even greater. Turning to Slide 14, LNG demand has already doubled since 2000 and it is predicted to double again by 2025. Meeting this demand would require three elements maintaining the reliability of the existing supply, delivering current LNG projects under construction and investing in the construction of new LNG capacity. Even if the first two elements are well in hand this still leaves an opportunity of around 150 million tons per year of new projects to be sanctioned. Now my buyers are counting on the United States to make up the shortfall with pricing linked to Henry Hub. Even if you believe the most optimistic predictions of new U.S. supply available for export, there are still projected short fall of more than 50 million tons in 2025 and more reasonable predictions of U.S. exports suggest a GAAP of around a 100 million tons in 2025. So the U.S. alone will not bridge this forecast demand supply gap. And that\u2019s we believe new supply needs to come from multiple sources. Now developing these supplies will also take time whether that\u2019s for permitting a construction of U.S. LNG export terminals or for exploration, appraisal and development of new producing regions such as East Africa. Building and maintaining LNG facilities is technically challenging, capital intensive and require significant expertise. The last 35 LNG projects developed globally took on average over 16 years to deliver that LNG to market. Although we do acknowledge that completion times are improving. Additional capacity utilization rates for LNG facilities in production have only averaged about 85% in recent years. Geopolitical instability, resource availability and unplanned turnaround have resulted on average in roughly 35 million metric tons of the existing nameplate capacity being unavailable at any given time. Turning to slide 15, well we have seen growth in global energy trading and expect that interregional trade of LNG will continue to increase, we believe that global gas markets will remain regionally distinct over the medium to long term. This is mainly due to the high cost and relatively lack of infrastructure to transport and store gas globally. While 2/3rds of the world\u2019s oil is shipped by tanker only 10% of the world\u2019s current natural gas supply is shipped as LNG and this forecasted increase to 14% by 2025. We believe the majority of this LNG will continue to be delivered under long term contracts. The traditional LNG importing countries of Japan, Korea and Taiwan have no interconnecting pipeline infrastructure and virtually no indigenous energy resources and therefore rely on LNG to meet almost of their gas demand. Only 5 years ago 17 countries were importing LNG, today 26 countries are doing so and this is expected to increase. So let\u2019s move to slide 16, where I would like to focus more specifically on U.S. LNG exports. Many analysts forecast that U.S. LNG export should reach approximately 50 million tons per year by 2025 equivalent of around 11% of the world\u2019s LNG demand and by 8% of domestic U.S. gas demand. At these levels U.S. LNG exports would only represent the small share of the global LNG market. Greenfield LNG projects are unlikely to be developed outside of the United States unless its significant portion of the offtake is committed under long term contracts with robust pricing that underpins the financial investment required to monetize these resources. A common perception is the Henry Hub linked pricing will be landed LNG prices in Asia will be significantly less than other world sources. We think that\u2019s not automatically a given. U.S. Liquefaction cost are likely to rise as more projects compete for resources, including engineering contractors, fabrication yard space and project financing. In addition growing demand in the United States where new petrochemical projects, power plants, exports to Mexico and a transportation segment will mean new demand pull on the same supply base. Coupled with weather and storage effects this could easily increase price strength and volatility for Henry Hub. In order to ensure that sufficient supplies do get developed there needs to be cooperation alignment and understanding between LNG buyers and suppliers. This has helped when buyers diversify to energy mix, maintain a geographically diverse LNG portfolio, recognizing that no one region including the United States can meet all expected demand and finally take equity positions in LNG projects to ensure the right projects are built in the right places for the right price. We have seen this formula work in Gorgon and Wheatstone and we\u2019re confident the same will be true for Kitimat. Turning to Slide 17. I would like to now talk about our LNG sale commitments. From a portfolio perspective, we believe it\u2019s prudent to leave around 25% of volume for placement on the spot market for operational flexibility. However, at the individual project level, this ratio may vary. For example, on Gorgon, we are 65% committed. We are still prepared to increase volumes under contract. However, Gorgon is scheduled to come online at a time when limited new supplies are expected. So we are confident of being able to place uncommitted volumes into the market. On Wheatstone, 85% of Chevron\u2019s equity LNG is now committed on long-term basis. In addition to the Gorgon and Wheatstone Foundation projects, we have made good progress this year with buyers for LNG from our Indonesia Deepwater Development, or IDD. For our unsanctioned projects, including IDD, Kitimat and Gorgon Train 4, we are targeting to have around 70% committed under long-term contracts by the time we will reach a final investment decision. Once achieved, we will end up with our desired portfolio objective of having 75% of our LNG production sold through the long-term contracts. Turning to Slide 18. I would like to close by showing you how Chevron is well-positioned to become a major LNG supplier by the end of this decade based on Wood Mack estimates. With the project under construction at Gorgon and Wheatstone and with our existing equity shares in Angola LNG and Australia Northwest Shelf, we will be one of the top 10 LNG suppliers in the world. If we include Kitimat and Gorgon Train 4, we will potentially move into the top five. In summary, we see strong LNG market fundamentals supporting our growing LNG portfolio, which should allow us to deliver strong future gas generation for many years to come. I will now turn it back to Pat.\nPat Yarrington: Okay, thank you Joe. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the latest updates on our LNG projects. The Gorgon project is over 70% complete. We continue to make good progress on all fronts. In early October, we installed the third of five gas turbine generators. To-date, 14 of the 21 LNG Train 1 process modules have been installed, three are in transit and the remaining are scheduled to follow in fairly rapid succession. Work on the jetty is progressing. We now have 43 of the 56 jetty caissons installed, including those needed to support all key structural elements. We have recently reached mechanical completion of the domestic gas pipeline in preparation for operational readiness by year end. Onshore pipelines are complete on the Io/Jansz 30-inch pipeline. And finally, three wells at the Io/Jansz field are ready to flow gas and seven wells are completed at the Gorgon field. Wheatstone is proceeding per plan and is now over 20% complete. We continue to transform the site with ongoing earthworks and good progress on establishing critical infrastructure. Construction continues on the materials offloading facility and we completed our first permanent foundation in concrete pour in September. Site preparation continues with about 19% of our 23,000 piles driven including commencement of the LNG tank pile driving. Platform construction is over 43% complete and we have received critical platform equipment such as the power transformers and process vessels. We just completed our micro-tunnel boring under the shoreline in preparation for the offshore installation of the trunkline. Now, we posted several updated photos of progress made at both Gorgon and Wheatstone on our investor website located at chevron.com and I\u2019ll invite you to take a look at those. For Kitimat, front end engineering continues on plan. We have remained focused on early earthworks at the LNG plant site, where construction on the office, camp industrial site and service road is ongoing. Key activities for the Pacific Trail Pipeline are obtaining necessary permits, building roads and securing right-of-way access. LNG marketing activities and the engagement with potential foundation customers are underway. The timing of the final investment decision will be determined by our ability to secure sufficient LNG offtake agreements with our customers. Turning now to Slide 20. I\u2019d like to share some highlights of the strategic progress we have made during the quarter. We signed binding long-term sales and purchase agreements with Tohuku Electric Power Company in Japan to supply just under 1 million tons per year of LNG for up to 20 years. As Joe noted this brings total volumes committed to customers in Asia on a long term basis to 85% for our Wheatstone project. Continuing with the Australian scene we recently announced the acquisition of two deepwater exploration interest located in the Bight Basin off the Southern Australian coast. These are very large blocks with significant exploration potential and further reinforces the importance of Australia to Chevron\u2019s global growth strategy. In Canada we successfully completed an initial 12 week exploration drilling program in the liquids rich portion of the Kaybob area of the Duvernay Shale Play. Initial well results were very encouraging with average initial production rates in excess of 1200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Both of these developments are consistent with our focus on early entry opportunities which have the potential to generate the most value for our shareholders. We also had a major milestone in our downstream chemicals business. CPChem announced our investment decision for U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals project. This project includes construction of a 1.5 million metric ton per year ethane cracker as well as two new polyethylene facilities each with an annual capacity of 500,000 metric tons. This is an attractive project one that takes advantage of existing infrastructure and advantage fleet stock. Plant startup is planned for 2017. Turning now to slide 21, I would like to close by highlighting our continued strong performance particularly in our upstream business. Our 2013 year-to-date upstream earnings margin was $23.33 per barrel. Based on these year-to-date results we continue to lead our direct peer group by a wide margin. We\u2019re almost $5.70 per barrel ahead of our closest competitor. This is a position we have now held for 15 consecutive quarters. We also led on this important metric at the six month mark by over $4.25 per barrel against the wide range of EMP companies. These peer leading financial results are directly related to the quality of our investment decisions and the strength of our portfolio. We appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company, I would like now open up the microphone. Joe and I are happy to take your questions. We do have a full queue so please limit yourself to one question and a single related follow-up if that\u2019s necessary, we will certainly do our very best to see that we get all your questions answered. So Jonathan please open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\nEd Westlake: I will start with an LNG question, so I mean I\u2019m up late and I keep getting these stories from Australia on my iPad which I will see you know going around the market and you know people are very worried about the LNG (indiscernible) or whatever it is something else with the project. Maybe give us a color on how you\u2019re feeling about the startup date and maybe if there are any penalties if the date back in time what\u2019s the sort of pillar date to get Gorgon on screen. Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: You know I think we have been pretty upfront about acknowledging some of the challenges that we have had earlier, we talked previously about logistic challenges, labor productivity and weather challenges. We have solved for all practical purposes the logistics challenges and in fact we have asked for and received additional lay down space on the island and so we\u2019re able to now kind of build material and inventory on Barrow Island. Productivity I would space is improving on all fronts, but there are still some areas that still needs to improve. We\u2019re still impacted by weather, we had you know heavy rainy period back in June but right now we\u2019re in the good weather period and are making very good progress each month. I think we\u2019re moving into a critical phase from a scheduled standpoint on the project. We talk about getting all the Train 1 modules on to the island. That\u2019s proceeding pretty much as planned. I think they will be here by year end or shortly into the New Year, maybe one that will be mid quarter next year. What\u2019s important next is the mechanical, electrical and kind of instrumentation work and construction or contractor work on those activities is ramping up on the island now, but there are still uncertainties that exist with the projects of our size and our challenge every day is to mitigate the risks, find the risks, mitigate the risks as they arrive, but the jetty I think we are trying to say all the critical elements of the jetty, the main critical elements of the jetty, those that support the structural elements are on plan. Right now, we are in the process of finalizing our budget for the year and should there be any reviews during that, that suggest the material change other than what we said previously will certainly bring that to your attention, but I don\u2019t have anything more to offer.\nEd Westlake: Thanks Pat.\nJoe Geagea: And let me address your question on the marketing side, I\u2019d like to say that our customers are our partners, so they fully understand the project challenges. I would also say that Gorgon is not coming up all at once is one train at a time. So that gives us time to work with our partners, with our customers on accommodating their needs and we have those discussions ongoing all the time. I cannot address specifically what\u2019s in our contract with respect to kind of these as you can appreciate these are commercial elements and I cannot address those.\nEd Westlake: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nEvan Calio: Yes, good morning everybody. And thanks for the LNG commentary as well as addressing that CapEx question. Staying with Gorgon, Joe, I mean can you update us on how the season\u2019s Train 4 is progressing and what is the interplay on Trains 1 and 3, their progress and the ultimate decision upon expansion meaning do your partners need to see more final Gorgon cost estimates before committing to the expansion and albeit at a significantly lower unit cost expansion?\nPat Yarrington: Yes, I think and maybe I will take the question around Train 4. I think we continue to work with our partners. We are all interested certainly in seeing this continue to progress. I think all of the JV partners are interested though in seeing Train 1 come up and seeing progress on 2 and 3 etcetera. Everybody wants to get an understanding of the cost structure. I also think that people want to get certainty around the fiscal and regulatory regime. And as you know, there has been a change of government in Australia and so a little bit of settling down and stability there would be appreciative. Those factors are going to be taken into account. I also think it\u2019s fair to say that the cost structure in Australia is different now than it was when Train 1 was taken, Trains 1, 2, 3 were taken to file investment decision back in 2009. The cost structure has elevated. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that, that has put at risk some of Australia\u2019s kind of global competitiveness. So from a Chevron standpoint, we are going to look at Train 4 and we are going to assess it under those new conditions and we are going to look at that relative to other opportunities that we have got in our portfolio and look for that next investment to compete with other opportunities. Obviously, a Train 4 does have certain Brownfield economic advantages to it, but we need to take those advantages lay in the new macro conditions that we see in Australia and take a look at the whole portfolio activity. Having said all that, we are continuing on with environmental approvals for Train 4.\nJeff Gustavson: So maybe I will add a bit of color commentary also, because the marketing is essential to Train 4 and all the reasons that Pat has mentioned, I would also say that the LNG market has different dynamics as well. Our job is to continue to find customer for Train 4, which we continue to do. We believe the offerings of the Train 4 are different than the offering of our other projects like Kitimat. Train 4 is an expansion, is a Brownfield expansion, Train 4 is exposure to Australia. Train 4, however, does not have equity unlike Kitimat where we are offering equity. So it really caters to a different set of customers and in our view from a marketing perspective, it\u2019s truly not competing with Kitimat and I think that\u2019s important for us to say.\nEvan Calio: So to follow-up does that mean the potential debottlenecking of Trains 1 through 3 is something that could potentially proceed a Train 4, I mean I know there are three different tranches of potential expansion. Does it change, I guess the debottlenecking opportunity move that forward or is that still something that we'd fall if it didn't back follow?\nPat Yarrington: Yeah. I mean I think Evan that we would -- I mean debottlenecking is always something that you would do kind of as an ordinary course of activity and often times it has the very highest economics associated with it. So that will be taken into account in our normal planning process.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Societe Generale. Your question please.\nJohn Herrlin: Yeah. Hi, just two quick ones. With the Duvernay wells Pat, that how much were they running I know it's science times its early days but I am just wondering an approximate cost?\nPat Yarrington: You mean you are talking approximate well cost?\nJohn Herrlin: Well cost?\nPat Yarrington: Yeah, that's not a number that we want to give out at this point in time.\nJohn Herrlin: Okay, that's fine. Next one is on LNG, are you surprised at all that on the demand side in terms of customers that they haven't built more physical gas storage in Asia and do you think that will change as the LNG market builds up more?\nJoe Geagea: That's a very good question John. This is Joe here. It is going to take time for them to get there clearly there is capacity with the re-gas terminals we are seeing that in Thailand we are seeing that in Singapore but remember that market is huge so significant amount of storage has to be made available for it to really make a difference, I think we may get there eventually, but I see a slow pace to get to that point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: Joe first of all can you remind us what the contract resets look like on your base load marketing for Gorgon in particular and maybe when you're addressing the question if you could talk little bit about what are issues around Henry Hub pricing is really more about de-linking and the oil for example went for 150 boxes of course to actually depressing the current price and I've got a follow-up.\nJoe Geagea: I'll start by saying that most contracts that are of that length 20 year for them to be sustainable and to be win, win for both customer for buyer and seller, have reopeners on. We\u2019re not getting into specific, these reopeners are meant to really to make sure that the pricing formula continues to reflect the market. What I can tell you that all of our projects are paced, that we were not going to see major renewal for a big portion of the volume all in one year. We have been very careful in pacing these renewals over time, because again that's in our interest and in the buyers interest to spread that renewal timing over a longer frame than just having all occur in the same time. Back to your questions on Henry Hub there are two elements to it. We have been public in saying that LNG that comes out of the United States made in the United States it's perfectly okay for it to be price off of Henry Hub. LNG that is made in Australia, East Africa or Canada it's a harder proposition to see why you would introduce a regional market reference to those markets. So that's been very difficult. In terms of breaking the oil linkage I will tell you that for the last 40 years the industry has learned to operate within an oil framework that saw oil prices go up to $140 and go down to $20. I submit to you that within these traditional framework you can introduce S curves, you can moderate slops there is a lot of other levers that actually work to prevent LNG from becoming very unaffordable and the regions where affordability is becoming an issue. So I think we can address those excursions that could be harmful from an affordability point of view within a traditional framework without necessarily going to something unproven that could also be a lot more volatile. We've also said that one way for people to get a better attenuation on price for them to get into the equity side. That clearly gives them direct exposure to the Upstream side to the whole value chain and effectively you are getting an attenuation to pricing, because you are getting the whole value chain benefits from that. So hopefully that helps.\nDoug Leggate: It does a lot. Thanks Joe. And my follow-up hopefully also is a bit quicker, but we all watched the unit earnings trends, the very strong earnings trends you guys have had for quite some time now, but whether we want to look at cash, where the focus is earnings. And I guess my question is your DD&A runs about $6 lower than your peer group and it appears to be trending higher, so when you have all this, I guess, non-producing capital coming online from these new projects. Can you give us some feel as to how the DD&A trend is going to look, and I will be going back? Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Right. So Doug, I think you should expect we have seen and you should expect the trend to continue higher charges for DD&A. Certainly, that\u2019s the pattern we have seen over the last couple of years, it\u2019s the pattern that we see looking at 2013 versus 2012 and it is the expectation that I would have going forward for 2014 and it is a direct reflection of the capital investment programs that we have had underway and as we bring those new projects online, you see rate increases associated with that.\nDoug Leggate: Alright, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks Pat.\nPat Yarrington: But Doug, I guess I would say it\u2019s important even with that and we still have the leading earnings per barrel margin and we have the leading cash margin.\nDoug Leggate: I am just trying to figure out what the future trends going to look like when these projects come up flat.\nPat Yarrington: I appreciate that. Okay.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital. Your question please.\nPaul Cheng: Hey guys. Good morning.\nPat Yarrington: Good morning Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Two somewhat related question, one for Joe and I think one for Pat. For Joe, when we look at Kitimat campaign, if you can give us some idea that what is the competitive position relative to building a LNG trend in Kitimat again operate there, which is a pretty remote area and (indiscernible) could be unusual comparing to in Australia, whereas you guys have a lot of operation or in the Gulf of Mexico, which you don\u2019t have a lot of operation. So that\u2019s the first one.\nJoe Geagea: Okay.\nPaul Cheng: Pat, do you want to give you the second one first?\nPat Yarrington: Sure. Go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: If I look at, this is not an issue in the near term, but your current cash flow essentially just barely cover your CapEx and so at what point now of course when you have zero net debt is not an issue today, but theoretically that\u2019s a management standpoint at what point you restart questioning whether you want to continue borrow money to buy back stock and at what (indiscernible) that continue once that you enumerate the share buyback that we have to relook at your CapEx program?\nPat Yarrington: Okay, good question.\nJeff Gustavson: I\u2019ll go first Paul on the Kitimat question. And it\u2019s a very good question. I will start by talking a little bit about the resource base. If you look at our acquisition of that resource base, we are very, very pleased with the entry price. So we also know that we have a huge resource base in both Liard and the Horn River. And that resource base sits right at the gate of North Asia, where we continuously see increased demand. So strategically, it is very well-positioned for North Asia buyers and our buyers see that and that\u2019s the value proposition would have been communicated to them. They also see in Kitimat two partners that have complementary skills. They are very aligned and very committed to the project. They see a settled government and a provisional government that are supportive and understand the opportunity. They see a country that is very much in favor of exports and coping toward Asia. They see a project with export permits in hand and a clear line of sight on a pipeline and a transportation solution. And I did say something about the labor cost. I will tell you though if we are the first out of the gate, we will have an ability to attenuate that versus being the last one coming in to develop the project. And finally, what we tell our buyers this is a great opportunity for them to participate through equity and the whole value chain. And in doing so, they really get direct exposure to North America gas pricing. All of those are good value drivers for any buyer in North Asia. They are getting it. I think we are getting good reception. And obviously time will tell and our ability to sign contracts, but we are very encouraged by what we see and the value that Kitimat can offer to those buyers. And I will go back to Pat for the capital question.\nPaul Cheng: Still before that, from a cost standpoint, do you from what you can, because you know a lot about Australia and I presume you know quite a lot about Gulf Coast is developing cost and operating cost of Kitimat is going to be competitive with Australia but cheaper than Gulf Coast or any kind of insight that you can provide?\nJoe Geagea: It is too early for us. I remind you that we have signed a transaction in February of this year. We became operator in July of this year. We are really getting out there. There are two things here that we need to be very careful on it is project development and execution which is really we're focused on and secondly the marketing and they have to go hand in hand. I would tell you though the freight advantage that we see in Western Canada clearly is something in favor of Canada compared to Gulf Coast exports.\nPat Yarrington: Okay and Paul just going back to your question. I want to start with the priorities that we've always put out there in terms of uses of cash , dividends first, reinvesting in the business, taking care of our balance sheet and then share repurchases really come at the very tail end of that. And you're right we are in a period. Right now our capital requirements are high just to remind you we've got five LNG trains under construction. That's a very significant component we do not have, we do not see in the forward-look that we will have anything as lumpy as that or as sized as that. So we know 2013 is a high C&E year We have said in the past that 2014 will be a high C&E year. George referenced last time on the call about a flattening that will occur. So we do see that the weakness of our capital spend period right now is not something that we see coming forward in future years. At the same time though we do fundamentally believe our greatest value proposition for our shareholders is finding and investing in the right resources and developing the right projects. And so we will continue to invest in the business and so you see us doing that in terms of resource acquisitions that I talked about earlier. So we try very hard to balance this returns and growth equation here and we've been very successful. The decisions that we have made and we believe the new resource acquisitions that we have made for future for growth 2020 and beyond are excellent projects. So we believe we're putting that equation together quite nicely. I guess the other thing that I would say is when you bring new resource acquisitions like we've done with Kurdistan or Cooper Basin or Kitimat, et cetera. When you're adding those elements to your portfolio, it does mean that you re-prioritize your portfolio and certain things probably fall towards the bottom. These would be more mature assets and less competitive in our portfolio, believe that they have potentially had spot in someone else's portfolio and that's where your asset sale or your portfolio optimization component increases. We've been very good doing that in downstream you've seen us do all that restructuring in downstream. Joe has overseen a fair amount of restructuring occurring in our midstream area and I think you can expect some additional assets sales now coming forward from upstream?\nPaul Cheng: Is there some form of metrics that you look at from a financial net debt to capital or net debt to EBITDA, you would look at say once you reach a certain level, the share buyback will say maybe that come to an halt?\nPat Yarrington: We obviously are interested in maintaining our AA status, credit rating status. We're not interested in infringing upon that at all so we look at that as kind of a limiting factor but frankly Paul we are such a long away from that at this point it's not a limiting component.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your question please.\nFaisel Khan: Two questions, first on the LNG facility in Canada, a potential LNG facility in Canada. Can you discuss the merits of owning the entire integrated asset and why not moving to a more asset like model where utility like company owns the liquefaction facility you own the resource and you market the gas and charter the sheds. I mean it seems like it's a very large piece of invested capital. There is a lot of companies out there especially in Canada and the U.S. that have the ability to finance this stuff at a much lower cost of capital. And then my follow-up is that, it seems like building a pipeline from Liard and Horn River to (indiscernible) or even to Kitimat. It's very expensive. There is a lot of depreciated type all the way from there down to the Gulf Coast that has a lower invested capital base. I mean why not they ship the gas down there and sign up any other facilities that are sort of ramping up. So that\u2019s a little bit less feel, but if you can help me answer this?\nJoe Geagea: That was not a less feel at all, Faisel. Good question. Let me tell you that we are not building a pipeline from the field to the LNG facility. We are clearly leveraging existing frontlines that currently won and they are operated and owned by others. The piece that we are building is the link from the frontline to our facility, I call that out umbilical. And that\u2019s very essential for us to actually control that, to control the feet going into the LNG facility. So where we can we are leveraging other facilities, infrastructures, processing plants could be another place, where we leverage as well. So we are adopting some of which you are suggesting. When we do this, we always look at the strategic fit of the asset. Is it essential for us to control it from a commercial point of view? Is it essential for flow assurance to our facility? Those are normally governing criteria for us to decide whether we want to own the interconnecting framework, same thing by ships. We can sell FOB as well and we don\u2019t have to build ships, but sometimes we have to build ships to ensure flow assurance on the back end of the LNG facility. The name of the game is really to get the molecules that we are just acquiring at a very attractive price in the Horn and Liard to the market and maximize our returns. And we look through that whole thing in details. And the other options also we are looking at from lowering the capital investment, we are asking other equity partners to come in. And by farming in for buyers, clearly, we are lowering the capital exposure. So we are looking all of that to basically address the element of the question that you brought, Faisel.\nFaisel Khan: Okay. And then the pipeline gas as you could pipeline all this gas down to the Gulf Coast on what\u2019s basically all depreciated pipeline, whether it\u2019s alliance or northern border and then down in GPL to the Gulf Coast, I mean, the invested capital of those assets is far lower than these pipelines at TransCanada and Spectra talking by building to supply that gas to the Canadian West Coast. I mean, is that an opportunity, where you can move that resource down to the Gulf Coast and export it out of the Gulf Coast and with the Panama Canal sort of opening up, I mean, it seems sort of like an asset like sort of model, but I don\u2019t know?\nJoe Geagea: [inaudible]. Thank you, Faisel.\nFaisel Khan: Okay, fair enough. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks very much. Two questions on your unconventional gas exposure U.S. gas production was up almost 5% year-over-year, is that primarily legacy Atlas acreage?\nPat Yarrington: I think, there is both an Atlas components as well as a kind of newer Permian Delaware Basin component to that.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay, fair enough. And then on to Europe, lots of headlines recently involving countries where you guys are operating or thought about operating in, Lithuania, Romania et cetera. Any status update you guys want to provide on how you are thinking about that?\nPat Yarrington: Yes, I think we are trying to say right from the get-go that this would be a long-term development opportunity and that it would take several years really to understand how the overall play could develop. We do think if it works and if it\u2019s proven up, then there is enough here to potentially build the business, but we are just in the very early stages of exploration and so I don\u2019t want to get \u2013 I don\u2019t want us leaping too far too soon with implications here. I mean we are active in Poland. We have drilled four wells there. We have got 3D seismic underway as well there. In Romania, we are picking up seismic activity. In Ukraine, we are still interested in having the PSA in the side we are hopefully getting closer on that. So we continue to make progress. It will be dependent upon the local governments and the local communities wanting to have us be there. And so that\u2019s been a challenge. It is an exploration play and so I think we need to give time to mature.\nPavel Molchanov: Right, appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nRoger Read: Yes. Good morning.\nPat Yarrington: Good morning.\nJoe Geagea: Good morning.\nRoger Read: I guess I would like to on the upstream side focus a little bit more on that cost side of things I mean obviously it was a good quarter in terms of realizations on the topline but you talked a little bit earlier about DD&A being an issue. Is there anything else maybe particular to the third quarter from an operating cost standpoint that's not recurring? I mean I know maintenance has an issue sometimes but I was just seeing if you could help us there and maybe think about how that unfolds in '14 and '15?\nPat Yarrington: I think from a cost standpoint exploration was heavier in the third quarter than the second quarter, but if you look on a year-to-date basis it's pretty much in-line with what we have seen previously. We're seeing higher industry costs you referenced that I think that's just a general trend that has been evident but also maintenance in the third quarter was a little bit heavier kind of pre-planned as well as some unplanned as well. So I think those are the factors that I would call your attention to.\nRoger Read: And in terms of any thoughts on '14 and '15 I mean are we seeing trends here I mean I agree with you there that the industry is seeing higher cost but are there any trends specific to Chevron that we should think about or even another way of asking it as the LNG projects come on are we going to see that as a significant impact maybe lowering operating cost?\nPat Yarrington: Yes. I don't think there is anything unique in Chevron's operations going forward that I would suggest and I think I'll differ on the LNG operation side of things. I'm not in a position to comment about what op expense looks like in 2015 and 2016 at this point. Okay. I think we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Allen Good from Morningstar. Your question please.\nAllen Good: Just a couple for Joe on LNG. You've been pretty detailed on the merits of Canadian gas relative to Gorgon and relative to U.S.. Should we go and take it that exploring natural gas out of the Gulf Coast doesn't fit competitively within Chevron's current LNG portfolio?\nJoe Geagea: You're making too many assumptions right there. We are focused on Kitimat for now and again we have opportunities in Australia. We are not ruling anything out at this stage but at the same time I am not prepared to tell you that we won't look at opportunities anywhere else in the world. For now we're focusing on Canada.\nAllen Good: And then finally you mentioned the appeal of the equity availability in Kitimat for some of your potential partners. Is there a minimum equity stake that Chevron would like to retain in Kitimat or vice versa of sort of target that you'd like to sell down as a portion of equity in the project?\nJoe Geagea: We have not put any number out there obviously it's up to the buyer also to indicate interest. We kind of like a number in our mind in terms of what end up but it's really a function of where the buyers are. We're flexible and remember we've got a partner as well and we got to consult with them in terms of where they like to end up. The gate is open though for the buyers to tell us what they think I don't know that we have indicated externally what that number is but we're open to entertain the buyer's ideas.\nAllen Good: I'll just get one more quick one. If you've been -- you make a pretty convincing case that demand for LNG will be out there. Do you see any threats in the supply side, though, that could potentially disrupt the potential long-term economic for LNG projects?\nJoe Geagea: In fact, I see the threat in the opposite direction, I see the threat as the longer it\u2019s taking us to enable project to reach FID and you fast forward it 4 to 5 years how long it takes to build them. This market can only go up and that is not really where the buyers would like and that's why our plea with the buyers have been we need to enable supply to come to the market because we have not seen anything on the demand side that is managing that carefully we see more subsidy, we see nuclear out of the energy mix. We see shale gas development, a lot of places slower outside the United States all of that point to more need for LNG and I look at how many projects are actually reaching FID outside the United States. I don't see a whole lot and that can only mean problem down the road and we've seen that play out in the past. Back in 2007, there was an estimate of about 75 million tons of LNG that will hit the market in '14. As we sit today it is only 10 million tons that will come in '14. So we've got to crack this equation both from the supply side and the demand side, and the longer we see projects delayed from reaching FID, I think the price equation gets more difficult.\nAllen Good: Yes, great. Thanks for that.\nPat Yarrington: Okay, thank you. Before we close off the call, since we didn\u2019t get a question on Ecuador, I would like to provide our investors an update on this matter before we close out here. It\u2019s a very important matter. As you are probably well aware that we are in several recent positive developments related to this ongoing litigation earlier in the year several key witnesses, financiers and other associates including an Ecuadorian judge involved in the case publicly been announced and exposed numerous examples of the blatant fraudulent tactics used by the plaintiff lawyers during the trial. But more recently an International Tribunal convened under the authority of the U.S. Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty and administered by the permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague found that the Settlement and Release Agreements between the Government of Ecuador and Texaco in the mid to late 1990s released Texaco Petroleum Company from any liability for all public interest or collective environmental claims. Now, this was a definitive ruling on the single most important legal issue in the case. And it was made by an impartial Tribunal in The Hague, where Chevron had picked one arbiter, the Government of Ecuador had picked one arbiter and we both had agreed on the third. And it was a unanimous ruling. Importantly, this ruling confirms that the claims against Texaco were not valid and should not have been brought in the first place. And it also signifies that efforts to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment, which the plaintiffs have so far unsuccessfully attempted in both Canada and Argentina that those are in direct violation of national and international laws. Now, separately, couple of weeks back on October 15, the U.S. trial began in New York related to Chevron\u2019s civil lawsuit against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters alleging legal violations, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Trial proceedings in this New York lawsuit are expected to last a few more weeks. So we are encouraged by these recent developments, but at the same time, we expect the need to continue to defend our position and defend our assets well into the future before a final resolution becomes available to us. So with that, I will close off finally here. And again, thank you for your interest in the company and your time here this morning. Good day to everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-08-02 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPat Yarrington: Hey thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President of Upstream and Gas, and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager for Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $5.4 billion, or $2.77 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. Our debt ratio at the end of June was approximately 12%. In the second quarter we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares and in the third quarter we expect to repurchase the same amount. Turning to slide 4, cash generated from operations was $8.5 billion during the second quarter and $14.2 billion year to date. On last quarter\u2019s call, I noted adverse working capital effects which reduced first quarter cash generation. In the second quarter, we saw some but not complete reversal of these effects. We expect further working capital release as remainder of the year unfolds. In June, the company executed a $6 billion bond offering taking advantage of historically low borrowing costs. Capital and exploratory expenditures were $8.6 billion during the second quarter and $16.8 billion year to date. The year to date amount includes incremental resource acquisition outlays associated with Kitimat in Canada, Cooper Basin in Australia and Kurdistan. George will speak to the value drivers behind these additions a little later. At quarter end, our cash balances exceeded $22 billion giving us a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. As we indicated to you in March and as you saw in the first quarter, the company is moving toward a more traditional net debt structure. Jeff will now take us through the quarterly comparison.\nJeff Gustavson: Thanks Pat. Turning to slide five, I'll compare results of the second quarter 2013 with the first quarter 2013. As a reminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter earnings were $5.4 billion, about $800 million lower than first quarter results. Upstream earnings were down $967 million, reflecting lower liquids realizations and higher operating expenses associated with increase maintenance activities, partly offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects. Downstream results increased $65 million between quarters. The increase was driven by higher downstream volumes following heavy maintenance during the prior quarter, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses in lower chemical earnings. The variance in the other bar largely reflects favorable corporate tax items during the quarter. On slide six, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the second quarter were $49 million lower than first quarter's results. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $25 million, driven by decline in crude oil prices, partially offset by an increase in natural gas prices. Higher production volumes, primarily from our San Joaquin Valley, California and Delaware Basin, New Mexico operations increased earnings by $40million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including higher operating expenses related to maintenance and other production related activities, as well as slightly higher exploration expenses. Turning to slide seven, International Upstream earnings were $918 million lower than the first quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $550 million, average liquids unit realizations declined by 8% in line with the decrease in average current spot prices between quarters. The timing of lifting in Kazakhstan and across multiple other countries decrease earnings by $60 million, higher operating expenses due to increase maintenance activities in the startup of the LNG plant in Angola, decrease earnings by $195 million between periods. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects improved earnings by about $105 million. The second quarter had a gain of about $275 million, compared to a gain of about $170 million in the first quarter. The other bar includes the absence of favorable tax effects during the first quarter and higher exploration expenses. Slide eight; summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decrease 63,000 barrels per day between quarters. Lower prices increase volumes under production sharing in variable royalty contracts during the second quarter by about 5,000 barrels per day. Plan turnaround activities in Kazakhstan and Australia have the largest impact reducing production by 45,000 barrels per day. The base business in other bar includes normal fuel declines in lower natural gas demand primarily in Thailand. Turning to slide nine, U.S. Downstream earnings were essentially flat between periods. Higher volumes increased earnings by $245 million at several refineries came back on line during the second quarter, following a particularly heavy maintenance period during the first quarter. Stronger margins increased earnings by $50 million due to lower crude prices, as well as tighter product inventories, operating expenses increased by $180 million largely due to higher fuel consumption, transportation and environmental related expenses. Lower chemicals results reduced earnings by $110 million, primarily due to lower ethylene margins and reduced volumes on planned and unplanned downtime at two separate plans. On slide 10, International Downstream earnings improved by $63 million between quarters. Higher volume increased earnings by $80 million primarily on the absence of maintenance activities at the Cap Town, South Africa and Burnaby, Canada refineries. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $50 million reflecting higher fuel usage and employee cost. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items including an unfavorable swing in foreign exchange impacts and weaker refining margins, partially offset by positive inventory evaluation effects driven by following prices during the second quarter. Slide 11, covers all other. Second quarter net charges were $350 million, compared to $439 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $89 million between periods. Favorable corporate tax items resulted in $145 million benefit to earnings, while corporate charges were $56 million higher this quarter. In part, higher corporate charges reflected an asset impairment as noted in our interim update. Year-to-date net charges in the All Other segment were 789 million at the end of the second quarter. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $400 million to $500 million for the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. George is now going to provide an update on our upstream operations. George?\nGeorge Kirkland: Thank you Jeff and good morning. To begin, I\u2019d like to note the progress of our Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot projects for the Gulf of Mexico. This photo shows the hulls of both platforms at the yard in Ingleside, Texas. The topside modules and hulls of the projects are currently being integrated. Since this photo was taken, additional modules were set on top of the Big Foot, which is pictured on the left. The Jack/St. Malo towed to its location is scheduled for year end. Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot remain on schedule for 2014 startup and these are important contributors to our 2017 production target, supporting our profitable growth. Now let\u2019s take a look at our financial performance on slide 13. Our 2013 year-to-date upstream earnings margin was $23.88 per barrel. Based on first half results for the peer group, we continue to lead the competition by a considerable margin. We are almost $6.50 per barrel ahead of our nearest competitor. We have now held this top position for 14 consecutive quarters. This result flows from the quality of our investment decisions, the strength of our portfolio and the strong execution performance of our base business and projects. I\u2019m also very pleased with our upstream return on capital employed which is almost 20%. I expect this to rank at the top of our peer group. Now I\u2019ll cover our 2013 production on slide 14. Production in the first half of the year averaged 2.61 million barrels a day, at an average year-to-date Brent price of $107.50 per barrel. The first half results are near our forecast, giving our planned turnaround and maintenance activity. We anticipate an increase in production in the second half of the year. Our 2013 production guidance remains unchanged at 2.65 million barrels a day at an average Brent price of $112 per barrel. I\u2019m pleased that Angola LNG has achieved startup and has now loaded two cargoes to date with another preparing to load. This significant milestone is the result of the hard work of many individuals in Angola and around the world. For the second half of the year, we anticipate Angola LNG will be ramping up and will be a large contributor to our production. We plan to load at least 13 cargoes by year end. Remember, at peak rates, ALNG should contribute about 60,000 barrels per day to our production. We will have additional production rampups from our other major capital projects including Usan and Tahiti 2. We restarted Frade in Brazil at the end of April and currently have 3 production wells online. As seen in the graph production growth in the second half also comes from our base operations. This includes additional cost recovery from production sharing contracts, additional production out of the Marcellus and an increased drilling activity in the Permian. These increases are partially offset by the planned turnarounds. Overall in 2013, we expect to have a similar level of turnaround activity as we had in 2012 and relatively heavy for both these years. We continue to have confidence in meeting our 2017 growth target as we bring on new projects and other key developments. I would like now to update you on the status of a few key projects. Turn to slide 15. Gorgon is now almost 67% complete. Barrow Island construction has achieved major milestones including the installation of the second gas turbine generation for Train 1. The third of five generators for the site will arrive later this year. Seven major process modules are on their foundations and now 11 of the 51 modules are on Barrow Island. The remaining 10 Train 1 modules are schedule for delivery by year end. We also recently completed the installation of the 20-inch domestic gas pipeline. The Gorgon team has resolved the logistic challenges they faced earlier, additional lay down areas on Barrow Island were established and material handling has significantly improved. Increase transportation capacity has allowed the project to exceed material delivery targets. Construction productivity has improved in some key areas and our team is focused on increasing productivity across the Broad for Barrow Island construction. Gorgon module fabrication is progressing and we are managing it closely. We also continue to carefully monitor labor costs and weather impacts. In the Upstream, the first five sea -- subsea wellheads were set. We have finished the lower completion of all the Gorgon wells and 50% of the [Jens Iago] wells. As one of our key legacy assets, with over 200,000 barrels a day of production net Chevron share, Gorgon will be a major contributor to our future financial performance. We have posted several updated photos of progress made at both Gorgon and Wheatstone on our Investor website located at chevron.com, and I\u2019ll encourage you to go there and look them. Next, I will review progress on some of our other key developments. Wheatstone made significant progress in 2013, with the team focused onsite infrastructure and upstream fabrication. We now have over 2,200 people onsite at Onslow. The offshore platform fabrication began in South Korea with erection of the seller deck. Offshore dragging began for the pipeline. The first phase of the construction village has been completed and the new runway at Onslow airport is nearing completion. The remaining activities for 2013 focused on site work to prepare for module deliveries in 2014. Wheatstone remains on target for a late 2016 startup. Kitimat marked an important milestone on July 1st, with the transfer of operatorship for LNG plant in the Pacific Trail Pipeline development to Chevron. Front-end engineering is progressing on plan. Early earthworks continue at the LNG plant site were a total of 6.5 million cubic yards of earth and rock have to move. LNG marketing activities and engagement with potential foundation customers are underway. We are focusing on Asian markets and aimed to have 60% to 70% of the LNG volumes under long-term commitment prior to a final investment decision. In mid-July, we entered into an arrangement with YPF to facilitate the development of a section of the Vaca Muerta Shale Basin, which has a significant potential for both liquids and gas production. This initial program includes 100 wells in a Pacific portion of 96,000 acre development area. This development provides a new opportunity that we believe will be competitive with other projects in our portfolio. Above ground risk, have largely been mitigated through government decrease and the financial structure, all in all we are pleased with the deal and the opportunity to participate in the development of this world-class resource. The projects that I\u2019ve just been reviewed provide legacy growth and production, and cash flow. Now I\u2019ll provide an update on our exploration activities. Please turn to slide 17. We have another active year of exploration, where we all plan to invest over $3 billion. We're making great progress in our key focus areas of the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, Australia and North America unconventionals. Outside of those areas, we have a mixture of conventional and unconventional exploration enhanced by key acreage additions. We have drilled or currently drilling 10 of our 14 plant impact wells for 2013, including the second well in the Kurdistan region of Iraq which spud on Wednesday. Now I will highlight a few areas of new activity for 2013. We are maintaining our emphasis on the Permian portfolio and we are increasing drilling activity in exploration, appraisal and development. We\u2019ve enhanced our position in the liquid rich Delaware basin and are now the largely leaseholder with significant potential in undeveloped acreage. We drilled our first two wells in the Utica in Ohio and are encouraged by the preliminary results, and we will provide more details on this later this year. We\u2019ve added another block in Kurdistan -- in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and our plan is to complete and begin testing two wells this year. Our Australian portfolio has increased with the addition of acreage in the Cooper Basin tight gas [point]. Exploration and appraisal wells are in progress. We\u2019ve also acquired new acreage in China, Brazil, the US Gulf of Mexico and Morocco. Finally we just announced an agreement for the acquisition of additional acreage in the liquids rich region of the Kaybob, Duvernay basin. This complements our existing acreage position where we had drilled 10 of our 13 well program. Results for these stage fracs are positive with significant condensate yields. These portfolio additions demonstrate how we continue to selectively capture future growth opportunities remaining focused on value, adding assets that can sustain our strong financial performance. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Pat.\nPat Yarrington: Turning to slide 18, George just provided an update on recent upstream activity, three milestones were met in the quarter in our downstream business. First, the Richmond refinery successfully restarted. By quarter end, the refinery was fully operational and running at planned utilization rate. Second, GS Caltex\u2019s Yeosu refinery began commercial operation of the heavy oil upgrading unit which now makes Yeosu one of the largest heavy oil upgraders in South Korea. This unit came online three months ahead of schedule. Third, our chemical joint venture Chevron Phillips Company announced plans to expand its ethylene production at its Sweeny Complex in Texas. I will close by highlighting our continued strong performance on total shareholder return as shown on this slide. We continue to lead the peer group by a significant margin which shows we are executing well against the right strategies. I would also like to point out the balanced manner in which our returns were achieved. We know the importance of not only providing returns via a competitive and growing dividend but also from disciplined reinvestments in our business to generate future value. We are fully committed to delivering disciplined growth and shareholder value and our objective is to continue to lead the peer group on total shareholder returns for a long time to come. We appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. And now I would like to open the microphones for questions. We do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up if necessary. We will do our best to see that we get all your questions answered. Sean, please open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Sankey: On the recent acquisition commitments in Argentina, it was at a time when your CapEx is very elevated, and additionally I think there has been some legal issues around, can you just underline for us why you are making a move like that at a time, as I said, when your CapEx is still elevated and (inaudible) the legal complexity that you probably really don\u2019t need?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, Paul, it always starts back at what\u2019s the opportunity set out there and how does it compete in the future, we\u2019d like the opportunity from a technical point of view. When you look at it technically, this opportunity, much of the shale is in 1000 foot range of thickness. So it\u2019s very attractive that way. We\u2019ve been in Argentina a long period of time. So we understand, I think, Argentina quite well. So we feel comfortable that way. And we always have within our portfolio some ability to spend our money in different ways. We have the ability because of our base business programs that we can move some moneys around. I go back, the other point would be that opportunities are there when they are available and this one is available. On the legal side, I would start off and say, first-off, we really don\u2019t believe there is any legitimate legal claim against us. So that\u2019s -- we're pretty confident about that. We think we\u2019re in a good position there. Back home, the development itself we see this very much as a stage development over a long period of time. The initial work is 100 wells and depending upon that success, we will move forward from there. We also see Argentina as a country that\u2019s got a large resource potential. We really believe that over the long period of time, they can move from an importer potentially, an exporter accrued. And once again, the time for the opportunity was now.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. So it\u2019s\u2026.\nPat Yarrington: Go ahead.\nPaul Sankey: So I was just going to follow-on with -- on reference, your sales reference, this is a high-intensity period of CapEx with the two Australian LNG projects above all, simultaneously in your Q. Can you talk about your longer term CapEx and the potential to bring that down with a view to generating more free cash flow or are you intending to push through to try and grow the company beyond the existing 3.3 million barrel equivalent target that you have for 2017? Thanks.\nGeorge Kirkland: First, Paul, we\u2019ve got to disconnect those two. They are not necessarily they are totally connected. At our March meeting when we met in New York, we told people that we see our growth beyond 3.3. We did not disclose what their growth would be. It\u2019s a little premature to go there but we do see growth beyond that. One of the points that we talked about it that time was the growth that we saw that would be coming from a future growth project and the low pressure management project in Tengiz. When we originally committed to our 3.3, about 80,000 barrels a day of our growth to 2017 was related to the Tengiz expansion. And that project is not going to be on line in 2017. So it contributes to significant growth. And remember the Tengiz project in total will add -- the expansion will add about 130,000 to 140,000 barrels a day of net production for Chevron. So we do see growth beyond 2017. But likewise, we always see some projects that tend to move a little bit to the right, move a little bit later. So we take that money and invest it in other opportunities because we have a very strong portfolio. I would tell you as we get Gorgon and Wheatstone completed those investments, we do not have anything as large in our portfolio on a capital expenditure basis as large as those. So from that perspective, we will see some decline in our capital program in a relative sense. But remember, we\u2019re also going to be a lot bigger in the barrel side. We will have a lot more barrels to our cash flows. Our cash flows will be high. We got very strong margins. So we\u2019ve got that combination to go forward. So it\u2019s a combination of things that move around but remember portfolio, lot of barrels, lot of barrel growth, 25% growth. We\u2019re looking at holding our margins, our margins which are industry leading we think we will hold them. So we\u2019re going to have cash flow growth and a flattening and I would call it more a flattening of a capital program going forward.\nPaul Sankey: Thanks George and thanks all of you, thanks also for taking the time to come on the call.\nPat Yarrington: Thanks Paul. Okay, next one?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nEvan Calio: Good morning everybody and George, thanks for the update on the upstream projects and clear on the free cash flow. My first question is on the Permian. Now there has clearly been a lot of exciting industry results, you entered the Cimarex joint venture. I know you\u2019re building a technology center there. I mean can you quantify at all for us the activity ramp or potential organic growth there in the basin and how Chevron is building or expanding its Permian capabilities to run a bigger organization? And I have a follow up.\nGeorge Kirkland: Maybe I\u2019ll start back with what we said in March of this year. We expect to drill over 300 wells in the Permian Basin, in the Midland Basin itself we see growth in the Delaware Basin. Remember we added the Chesapeake acreage in New Mexico to acreage we\u2019d already had there. This recent Cimarex deal in the Permian is really is bringing together a checkerboard of acreage of ours and Cimarex. Why do we do that? Well we do that to increase efficiency and effectiveness of the dollars we spend. We reduce geographic acreage loss if you will. We can drill longer laterals, so it\u2019s just a much more efficient way to develop that acreage. As we said in March, we are going to see our rig count grow considerably over this period. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done anything post-March that doesn\u2019t fit with the plans that we showed at the March meeting. Our plans are pretty consistent in that growth profile both in acreage and in barrels. We do expect that our net production to grow towards in the Permian Basin into that 200,000 barrels.\nEvan Calio: But I mean just any color\u2026\nGeorge Kirkland: So -- go ahead.\nEvan Calio: Yeah, I didn\u2019t know, there was any color on the technology center that you\u2019re building or people addition or just what investments you are making to build an infrastructure that would support more significant organic growth there.\nGeorge Kirkland: We will. We have committed to a tech center there. We have -- we are starting a building, a significant building project there, [harness] project. We\u2019ve purchased land and moving forward we are building that. And I would also tell you, remember, we\u2019ve got a big support function for that unit also out of Houston. So we\u2019re -- I think we\u2019re in good shape on what we have in Midland and we have a strong commitment, we have lots of acreage and Midland and the Permian Basin and the Delaware Basin are long-term assets for us. But I don\u2019t really have anything that\u2019s new beyond what we presented in March.\nEvan Calio: That\u2019s fair. And if I could a second on just quickly on Gorgon. Can you provide any update on cost trends or color since your guidance earlier in the year or when or what key milestones will trigger any cost update there?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well I would tell you we\u2019re always looking at the cost and watching the cost. We review the project once every month from my level and John Watson, we both take a -- have a project review once a month. We look at progress, we look at costs, we look at issues, we look at mitigations that our project team are putting in place. And as you know, a big project like this there is always issues that people are solving problems. And our people are very good at that. I mentioned today that we really think we have solved the issue around the logistics; that was important for us. We are not going to know a lot more on costs till we get really much further in. we don\u2019t see any major disconnects at this point. We see, as an example, the first half of the year exchange rates are really pretty close to what we assumed in our plan. It\u2019s -- the first part of the year, the rates were higher than parity, the second quarter they were down but for the year they are pretty close. And now we\u2019re seeing a shift in exchange rates that are -- in our -- positive for us with exchange rates coming down and we are in a period where we got major expenditures in Australia. We\u2019ve got a lot of moving parts there, so we can always tell where we've been a lot better than where everything is going and any issues once again we try to mitigate those as they go. But I don\u2019t see anything major on the costs side. It\u2019s still back to productivity and I\u2019ll emphasize it\u2019s critical to get productivity on Barrow Island and it\u2019s important for us to have good weather. Weather is an extremely important part of our success there and we\u2019re in the good part of the year right now, between now and December we are outside of major weather impacts. So we\u2019re in a period that we get to December. We will know and offer lot more. We are 67% now and every time you get little bit closer towards 100% you can do a lot better forecasting.\nEvan Calio: Great. Always helpful, George. Thanks.\nGeorge Kirkland: Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Thanks Evan. Next caller.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nArjun Murti: Thank you. My thanks for the E&P update as well. Just a follow-up question on Kitimat, where you have now had sometime to look at the project? And I know the two pieces our progressing the feed and then I think you mentioned you want to get 60%, 70% of the deal sold to long-term customers? On that later point, you now have Exxon with the big project in the area. I think Shell\u2019s get one. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to give a bunch of specifics, though we\u2019d certainly welcome them? But can you at all talk about, how it\u2019s going in terms of marketing this. I know there is a question us to whether they\u2019re might be some linkage to Henry Hub? How are you feeling about Kitimat and it position and your ability to get that gas sold? Thank you.\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, first off, I\u2019d say, I think, we have a considerable time lead versus any of the other developments in the BC region. This project has permits and plays for export. It has approval and permits in place for the site. We\u2019ve got most of the agreements for the pipeline route with the First Nations. Matter of fact, I think 15 or 16 of the groups of First Nation have already agreed. So I think we are in quite lead on the early part of a project. We\u2019ve also done a feed, one Train and we are now moved into a two Train feed to build two Trains there, we\u2019ve been involved in that. So we do have more work on feed but we are moving quite well on the feed work. So, we\u2019ll go back, once again, we are in a great competitive spot on schedule. That should help us a lot in dealing with those that want to buy gas that puts our project in many ways ahead of others, so for the buyers that need gas sooner in a very positive position. We do not plan to have Henry Hub linkage. We expect the Henry Hub equivalent value will come through some equity sell-down. We do plan to have a partner as buyers, we are going to offer volumes, some volumes and interest in the plant as a combination. We think that\u2019s a big advantage. We frankly think that\u2019s better than Henry Hub pricing. Henry Hub like any index has variability, variability means it goes up or it can go down and we believe that we can get the same or a better situation for a buyer through their participation, equity participation in the Kitimat project. We can do that because the two partners in us and Apache each hold 50%. We hold very strong working interest in the plant and in the resources. So we have that ability to move that way. So our goal is, of course, to maintain advantage, first mover advantage in that. But at the same time, move the project at the right speed, having done all the appropriate technical work. And once again having all the commercial work done to gets us to 60% to 70% position with regard to sales. We\u2019ve had some initial discussions with Asian buyers. We will not disclose the ones that we\u2019re talking with at this time. But we are moving that forward.\nArjun Murti: That\u2019s just very darn helpful. Just a very quick follow up in terms of the appropriate speed, we\u2019ve always thought that this is more likely to be a 2014 FID versus \u201813 which I think at one point had been talked about -- I don\u2019t know if you can comment on that.\nGeorge Kirkland: I wouldn\u2019t disagree that it's more likely to be a 2014 FID. Once again we\u2019ve got to have all the right work done and what's critical for us and we\u2019re not progressing the project through FID until we have these agreements at least at a HOA level for 60% to 70% that will take us into 2014, to get those completed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.\nEd Westlake: Yes, thanks very much for all of the information this morning. Just coming to the offshore, I mean it feels as if with a loss position in the Permian and some of the LNG projects that you have, the write on offshore regrets and subsea costs might mean a shift in the portfolio. So I guess two questions, one is how are you mitigating the rise, what are you views on those offshore costs? And how much flexibility do you have to sort of shift capital around to avoid that inflation?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, everything depends upon the economics of the projects and our portfolio which is nice and large, we can move monies around. I will you each one of these investments look a little bit different. If you look at a deepwater development we end up with large wells on production sands, high production rates and because of that huge upfront cash flows, these projects come in, they have relatively high DD&A rate, would you look at their operating expense, they are extremely low and they have very strong margins. And it\u2019s back to economics. So now I will tell that the cost structure in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico post Macondo is higher. We have seen a 20% to 25% rise in the cost of wells. I will tell you we\u2019re trying to offset that in many other ways. Technology is one way. If you remember at our presentation in March this year and more recent press release of just around -- I think also in the March period where we talked about the performance of our multi-zone, the single -- our multi-frac single trip frac pack, we had great success with that. It saved us anywhere from 20 to 50 days in the completion operations of our deepwater Lower Tertiary wells. This multi-zone frac pack is a huge benefit for us in the cost side and our original -- in our initial test of the well after that we had very high rates. So I want to take you back this back to what do we think we can get on value proposition, we\u2019ve got the people to do the work in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We had the oil capability also onshore. And we will make choices on that but it comes heavily back to the technical quality of the asset.\nEd Westlake: I mean now that some people have deferred projects but at the moment the rig rates in subsea are they expensive enough given technology for you to do the same, is that what I am hearing?\nGeorge Kirkland: Our view of Jack/St. Malo today on economic basis is stronger than when we went to FID. Our project view has improved, as we learn more and more particularly about the Lower Tertiary and our ability to change the recovery rates in the Lower Tertiary, we see this as a better and better opportunity. Remember Jack/St. Malo we talked only of about a $500 million barrel tight recovery for those two fields and that was on 8% to 10% recovery rate. We\u2019re focusing on those technologies that can change that recovery rate and potentially raise it up to over 20%. And when you have the infrastructure in place already that additional production and additional recovery is frankly very economic.\nEd Westlake: Thank you very much.\nGeorge Kirkland: But each one of them is a decision into itself. We have to have to confidence in how much we are going to produce and we have to also have confidence -- when we reach up there, we do have confidence in how much we will spend to get that return.\nEd Westlake: Very clear. Thanks George.\nGeorge Kirkland: Okay and thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Next caller?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning everybody. Good morning George.\nGeorge Kirkland: Good morning.\nDoug Leggate: Question for you George. I want to ask you about portfolio capital intensity and I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand is when you set the original target for 2017, the CapEx numbers have been creeping higher but there is lot of stuff coming into the portfolio and the margin anyway that wasn\u2019t in the original plan, for example, the Permian Basin. So I\u2019m trying to understand, our things -- good thing for the right as you mentioned in your prepared remarks and the spending basically making up the difference and maybe just in order of magnitude, you\u2019re spending about 20% more than I guess your largest peer on a per barrel basis, I\u2019m just curious if you can just give us some flavors as to that whether or not you think that as a sustainable level of spend?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well, let me go back and say there are things that we had talked about and I gave the example of the future growth, the expansion in Tengiz as moving to the right. When I move to the right, when I moved later, it did move capital that way also. We look at these portfolio additions on the strength of them. And we don\u2019t only think about our investment ratios in per barrel basis. We are influenced heavily by the cash flow that these barrels give us. That\u2019s back to -- I don\u2019t believe we would be investing for this much growth if we did not have the strength of portfolio to generate the cash. Our earnings per barrel and our cash flow per barrel that we are generating, allows us on a cash flow basis to actually be investing much lower than many of our competitors. So we are investing on a cash basis less than most. It\u2019s heavily influenced of course by the quality and the amount of cash that we\u2019re generating from these barrels. I do believe that you\u2019re going to see our capital investment rate flatten with time. And it\u2019s really a function of the LNG projects that we\u2019re in today. We\u2019ve got Gorgon and Wheatstone which are very large. They build huge infrastructure and capacity for the future. They have very flat long lives. So we\u2019re building for them with them. I always tell people remember when Gorgon and Wheatstone together are on, that\u2019s over 400,000 barrels net per day for Chevron. Those are company side assets.\nDoug Leggate: Maybe I could ask my follow up with Pat is a related question. Pat, you obviously hold a lot of caps in balance sheet that\u2019s not generating earnings .What is your expectations for that trend as a proportion of capital rise or fall over the next several years non-producing capital, I mean, when you get there. Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Right. I think consistent with where George was going, I mean you are absolutely right. We are sustaining a relatively high proportion of pre-productive capital we call it at the present time. You would expect that rate to be sustained high until you get projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone coming on line. Both of those two projects combined, represent about $45 billion Chevron share of spending over this seven-year period of time if you look at the construction period for both projects. So that\u2019s obviously a significant component and until you get those projects online, we\u2019re going to have relatively high preproductive capital. Once those projects become online, then of course we anticipate that that proportionality will decline.\nGeorge Kirkland: Ed, I\u2019d just like to make one additional addition to that. I\u2019d take you back to the ROCE we have in our upstream segment. Yes, we do have a large capital employed that is not yet returning revenues and earnings. But even with that, you look at the return on the capital employed in total, we are leading in our segment. So that tells you where we\u2019ve invested and the performance of that portfolio is very strong. So it\u2019s back to our ability to invest is driven heavily by the quality of the existing portfolio to generate cash flow where we can invest in these large growth projects which are going to give us a 25% volume growth between now and 2017.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks for your answers folks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with your question.\nPaul Cheng: Hey guys, good morning.\nGeorge Kirkland: Good morning.\nPat Yarrington: Good morning Paul.\nPaul Cheng: George, maybe a little bit of this, from a strategic standpoint that we are looking at Kitimat in order for this to become a really great project, you probably look beyond just Train 1 or 2, I don\u2019t know whether that you really have sufficient gas resource up there yourself. So logistically then how share volume you look at here, so you will be just essentially saying okay, I have gas resource for the first two train and get it going and then subsequently I would be just be the owner of the train and not necessarily to be the owner of the natural gas and just process other people\u2019s gas or that you actually think that is important for you guys to be fully integrated?\nGeorge Kirkland: Well the second point first, I think it is very important to be fully integrated and to have the resource. Our view is being tempered at this point in time because we haven\u2019t been in the project as long as Apache has. But I take you back to the view that Apache is on the press with and what they view Liard and Horn River, their view of Liard alone is approximately 50 Tcf of gas. So if you take 50 Tcf of gas and you take Horn River and Liard, you\u2019ve got something greater than that. That is much more gas than is needed for a two train plant. A two train plant is more likely to be in the 15T of gas required. Bottom line, we are not short of gas at all in the Kitimat development. Our issue is to get foundation customers and the foundation project in place and then find a way to -- the next step is to look at the expansions. I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time on the expansions yet until we get -- we really get past having the first 2 trains once again sold from a market point of view and then get them post FID.\nPaul Cheng: Right. But I think I guess my question is that in the event if that those huge numbers that talked by Apache did not materialize and end up to be smaller, you still won\u2019t willing that you have to integrate model that including the ownership in the resource?\nGeorge Kirkland: Yeah I think we need that -- to have surety of the supply to feed the plant. So we\u2019re quite confident at this point for the first two trains. We\u2019ve done enough work that are confidence is high that there is a large volume of gas there. We have lots of appraisal work that will be done in Liard to confirm those volumes as we go forward. But I will tell you, all my engagement with our partner is quite confident in the quality of this resource.\nPaul Cheng: Second one, George, can you give somewhat idea that the base on your drilling result and how is the [metric] whether its Brent oil, condensate or NGL, what\u2019s our split we are talking about in the Permian Basin that you\u2019re drilling right now as well as Utica?\nGeorge Kirkland: I can give you a lot more on what we\u2019re seeing in the Permian Basin. We\u2019re focusing on the portion of the basin that we see greater than 50% liquids and I say 50% liquids looking at really the oil and condensate side, LNGs, pardon me -- LPG is not what I\u2019m speaking of. So it\u2019s really -- it\u2019s over 50% OEG in liquid with oil and condensate side. That\u2019s why we like it so much that that really carries a lot of value. In the Utica, I\u2019m not really prepared to give you those numbers, I would just simply take you back to what I said in my prepared comments for today that we are pleased with what we see. We\u2019ve had about 30 days of production test, production run actually on the first two wells. It\u2019s a little early to speak on that and we should be prepared in a little bit later in the third quarter to give a little bit more information on the Utica. But flexes just a little bit early, I would also tell you probably same time we would be prepared to speak a little bit more about the Duvernay in Canada because it is once again also a liquid play. And we\u2019ve just closed this -- closed on this additional 67,000 acres up in the Duvernay. I would tell you also maybe as the general comment, what we try to do every quarter is to have a big anchor position, like in the Permian Basin and then build additional acreage around it before we disclose all our results. It only make sense for us not to get our disclosures out in front of where we\u2019re trying to move from a commercial point of view. So we feel very good what we are in the Permian Basin. And my expectation is that we have other opportunities like Cimarex, we will make those happen to. But we like very much to get a nice position, build that position and it\u2019s particularly nice to build that position after you, truly understand the subsurface. So you understand how the rocks are and really how much of the volume is going to be oil or gas.\nPaul Cheng: George, is Permian is a primary frac oil or just primary condensate for you?\nGeorge Kirkland: The Permian is primarily oil.\nPaul Cheng: Frac oil for you.\nPat Yarrington: Thank you.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Thank you, Paul.\nGeorge Kirkland: Light oil.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.\nJason Gammel: Yeah. Thank you. I just want to follow up on LNG marketing which has been raised by few others. When you think about putting Kitimat into the marketplace, how do you contrast that with the potential for brownfield expansions at your Australian projects. How do you prioritize getting one into the market versus the other? And then just related to that, what\u2019s you sense of urgency in getting volumes into the market right now, given that there are projects moving forward pretty quickly in both East Africa and on the U.S. Golf Coast?\nGeorge Kirkland: Lot of question there Jason I\u2019ll try to hit those. I\u2019ll start of with contrasting maybe our Gorgon trains for versus what we have at Kitimat. First difference is scale and to the buyer we have a bigger offering of volume. We have 11 million tons with two trains, and we are doing the joint marketing. So we have 11 million tons there on offer that we will be available and once again we want to have 60% to 70% and we would be willing very much to move up to the 80% at the time of start up. In the case of Gorgon train for its 5.2 million ton per annum additional train, the difference there is also the gas coming out of Gorgon is marketed by each of the partners. We -- we're remarketing about 47% of the gas in Exxon Mobil and Shell, each have about 25%. So it\u2019s a much smaller volume to move for us, the plus for Gorgon is you\u2019re brown -- you\u2019re brownfield. So you\u2019ve got an advantage on the plant side, depending upon on where we are going in Asia, there is no difference in transportation from in distance and cost from going to Kitimat or coming from Australia. It actually depending on where you\u2019re going in if it\u2019s in North Asia, there may be a slight advantage for Kitimat. So it could be positive for us there but volumetrically it\u2019s positive. We do think from a development cost that -- the development cost at Kitimat on the upstream may end up being less than in the case of Gorgon. Gorgon has the benefit of the brownfield on the plant side. We have we think more control on the Kitimat project because of the partnership. We have 50% there and I think a very aligned partner and we are jointly selling the gas that I mentioned. In the case of Gorgon Train 4, three companies are selling the gas. So there is a different alignment there. We\u2019re happy to see both of them move. They are a little bit of a horserace between them at this point in our own shop. East Africa I didn\u2019t mention and I think people here reminded me, I actually see East Africa behind both of these projects. I don\u2019t believe East Africa from my perspective yet has an operator that\u2019s in place or a unit that\u2019s been created to move that project forward. So I think we do have a timing advantage on both of those projects to first gas. Gorgon we know we\u2019ve got all the gas, Kitimat we\u2019re confident of we\u2019ve got all the gas for two trains. So I think we have a little bit of an advantage there. And we do know our fiscal regime and regulatory regime in both the locations in which we operate very clearly.\nPat Yarrington: Okay, thank you Jason. Next question? I think we have time for a couple more questions.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question is all set from Iain Reid with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nIain Reid: Yeah hi there. Pat, could I ask you a question actually about the share buyback. You said earlier you\u2019re moving into more of a kind of net debt position going forward. You\u2019re obviously spending both on CapEx and dividend significantly more than you\u2019re generating cash flow at the moment and the buyback is kind of accelerating that process into net debt. What sort of point do you think the buyback has done its job in terms of that process? Have you got a kind of target level of gearing which you are aiming for? And when can we think about you perhaps scaling this back over the next several quarters? Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: It\u2019s a good question. I think I\u2019ve explained before how we look at share buybacks and it really is we try to take a medium-term point of view, we take a look at what\u2019s happening to commodity prices, we look at what our opportunity for reinvestment in the business in, we look at obviously a growing dividend profile that we want to make sure comes right off the top. We want to maintain flexibility in our financial structure and after we\u2019ve done that, sort of equation, if there are funds left over, that\u2019s when we fall into the share repurchase category. We do want to take -- we have tried to take a more medium term point of view here and not be in and out of the market just depending upon instantaneous circumstances in a given quarter. We do not have a targeted leverage ratio for the corporation. We look at the leverage ratio really as being an outcome of these other decisions that we have made. And we have tremendous additional leverage capacity as you well know. We\u2019re sitting here today with a 12% debt ratio; we have a long way to go before being overlevered becomes one of our problems. So I think you can consider when you look out and forecast your own commodity prices and take a look at the development stream that we\u2019ve got available to us and you look at our past practice on dividend streams, you can put together a cash flow model. We have a long way to go before net debt becomes a challenge for us.\nIain Reid: Okay, thanks for that. And can I just ask one very quick question for George? On Brazil, George, you talked about Frade coming gradually back on stream. But in that kind of growth profile you\u2019re showing for the second half of the year, is Papa Terra in that and also I wonder if you could also comment on Chevron\u2019s view of the pre-sold round coming up from Brazil?\nGeorge Kirkland: Frade, as you said is part of that addition in second half. We had no production in Frade in the first quarter -- second quarter, an average about 5,000 barrels a day. Our share at the month of June, we were closer to 10,000 barrels a day, our share. So there is some expectation there that we will go grow in the second half or we will have more volume in the second half in our project, not too far off from our original plan, the field is performing at this point pretty well. So that\u2019s a plus. On the case of Papa Terra, Papa Terra may come on production this year but it\u2019s not going to be a significant mover on production. Petrobras is still talking about bringing it own this year but it\u2019s late in the year. So we do not believe that it will -- it will be significant mover on our production for the year. With regards to the deepwater round, all our exploration opportunities, we review the opportunities set and we never disclosed upfront what we think of it, we always talk about what we did afterward and give more color at that point in time.\nIain Reid: Okay, George. Thanks very much.\nGeorge Kirkland: Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Okay. Thank you. I think we\u2019ve got one more -- time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. Our final question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nFaisel Khan: Thanks. Thanks guys. Good afternoon. Just on the key exploration around acreage traditions, it seems like you guys definitely had a good amount of acreage during the year and a few bolt-on acquisitions. Can you give us an idea of what the -- how much of that is your capital budget that made up and what\u2019s your appetite going forward. And I have a follow-up on downstream side.\nGeorge Kirkland: Faisel Khan, I\u2019d like to do a little bit of work because I think about 25% of 30% of our moneys are outside of our focus areas on the drilling side. So it\u2019s in that range. We like to keep -- in the past, we tried to push usually as much as 80%. So we\u2019re more in the 70% this year in our focus areas. And that\u2019s -- once again, I have kept the numbers exactly where we are for the year but the plan was we were going to be a little bit lighter in our focus areas this year. Our appetite is driven by a couple of things. It\u2019s of course the amount of money we have to spend and also the scale in the quality of the opportunity. It starts very much with quality of the rock that rock doesn\u2019t work we don\u2019t view the risk and the scale of the opportunity to be attractive. We don\u2019t go there. So it\u2019s not about acreage, it\u2019s about quality. Preferentially, if possible, we like to be in a low-cost option situation. We like to get a nice piece of acreage with a seismic obligation and minimal or low numbers of wells to drill. And that\u2019s particularly the case in these test areas, these areas outside of our focus areas. We don\u2019t want to get saddled with a really large program and then draw high risk well and find out it\u2019s not very attractive. So we tend to try to do that everywhere around the world and a lot of these opportunities that we moved into recently are very much structured that way, not a large amount of calls on upfront entry. And they have seismic obligations and small drilling obligations to answer really the geological question.\nFaisel Khan: Okay. Got it. On the downstream earnings -- focus on the U.S., the U.S. downstream results, if I extract out the chemical earnings, which I guess we can get that to Phillips 66, it seems like U.S. downstream earnings are basically breakeven, even first quarter and second quarter and given the refining position and marketing position you guys have, I would have thought that there would be a lot more profitability out of these assets. So can you give us an idea of how these assets are going to deliver that level of profitability? I know you\u2019ve talked about Richmond being down, I know some of the environmental expenses associated with that. But can you talk about how this -- taking out chemicals, how does U.S. sort of downstream perform in a way it probably should?\nPat Yarrington: Right. Faisel I think the key item is one that you already mentioned for our performance in the first half and it does have to do with unit downtime. If I look at the first six months of this year and look at what our utilization rates were for our -- this will be worldwide but it\u2019s obviously heavily influenced by the assets that we have in the U.S. If I look at our operated utilization rate for the first half, it\u2019s running a good 10 points or so below what would have -- you would have seen on average for the 2011 or 2012 time period. And that is a big penalty to absorb from an earnings standpoint. As we go forward and we look at the second half the year, I did mention that Richmond is up and fully operational. But as we look at the second half of the year, the vast majority of our downtime is already in the rearview window at this point. So I think going forward, if we can run reliably, then you\u2019ll have a much better outcome.\nFaisel Khan: Okay great. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nPat Yarrington: Okay. Well I think that concludes the call for the day and I appreciate everybody\u2019s interest in listening today and I particularly appreciate the questions that came in from the analysts. Shawn I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-04-26 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sean, and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The Company's first-quarter earnings were $6.2 billion, or $3.18 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 18%. Our debt ratio at the end of March was approximately 9%. In the first quarter we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the second quarter we expect to repurchase the same amount. Turning to slide 4, this week Chevron\u2019s Board of Directors declared a $1 per share quarterly common stock dividend payable in mid-June. This is an 11% increase and reflects the performance and strength of our current portfolio and are confident in our compelling growth prospects. Since 2004, our dividend has grown at a compound annual rate of 11%, a growth rate that is well in excess of the S&P 500 and better than our peers. You can see this on the left chart. This pattern demonstrates the priority be placed on rewarding our investors through increasing distribution. The chart on the right provides updated information on five-year rolling total return to shareholders, through the end of the first quarter. Our strong financial and operational performance and superior growth prospects for both production and value are being recognized by the market. We have led on this rolling total shareholder return for an extended period of time now and we are off to a strong start in 2013. Turning to slide 5, cash generated from operations was $5.7 billion during the first quarter, a lower level than it has been in some time. This was primarily the result of working capital impact. Overall, working capital requirements for the Company increased by $3.4 billion in the quarter. This working capital consumption of cash was principally in our Downstream operation. This is not an atypical pattern for us for the first quarter of the year, though this quarters increasing working capital requirements is larger than we have usually seen. The increase reflects the timing and pricing of commodity purchases and sales between quarters as well as the operational downtime we had at several refineries this quarter. The vast majority of these effects are temporary in nature and the impact that cash flow are expected to reverse in future quarters. Importantly, our Upstream business continues to generate strong cash flow. Capital and exploratory expenditures were $8.2 billion during the quarter, including expenditures associated with our buying to the Kitimat LNG project. We've continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and at quarter end, cash balances exceeded $19 billion, giving us a net cash position of almost $5 billion. Jeff will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.\nJeff Gustavson: Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide 6, I'll compare results of the first quarter 2013 with the fourth quarter 2012. As a reminder, our earnings release compares first quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year ago. First quarter earnings were $6.2 billion, about 1 billion lower than fourth quarter results. Upstream earnings were down $942 million, reflecting the absence of fourth quarter asset transaction gains, partly offset by higher realizations and a favorable swing in foreign currency effects. Downstream results decreased $224 million between quarters, driven by lower volumes largely associated with seasonal maintenance activity in the absence of fourth quarter asset transactions, partly offset by a positive swing in foreign currency effects. The variance in the other bar largely reflects lower corporate charges. On slide 7, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the first quarter were $231 million lower than fourth quarter's results. Higher realizations improved earnings by 95 million, driven largely by an increase in crude oil prices. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by $80 million, mainly due to increased maintenance activity in the Gulf of Mexico and fewer producing days in the quarter. The net of higher DD&A and lower operating expenses reduced earnings by $85 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including the absence of favorable tax effects and gains on small asset transactions in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 8, international Upstream earnings were $711 million lower than the fourth quarter. Earnings increased approximately $130 million, due to higher realizations, partly offset by lower liftings. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects improved earnings by about $200 million. The first quarter had a gain of $170 million compared to a loss of $30 million in the fourth quarter. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by about $200 million between periods, primarily due to reduced maintenance activities and employee costs. The other bar reflects a number of items, including favorable tax effects in addition to lower exploration expenses. Finally, earnings decreased by about $1.5 billion between quarters, primarily due to the absence of the gain on the Browse asset exchange recognized during the fourth quarter. Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 23,000 barrels per day between quarters. Lower cost recoveries on production-sharing contracts spread across multiple countries reduced production by about 16,000 barrels per day. This is an investment timing issue which we noted in our interim update. The base business and the other bar includes the impact of planned turnaround activity, weather disruptions and normal field declines. Contributions for major capital projects increased first quarter production by 9,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico and Platong II in Thailand. Turning to slide 10, U.S. Downstream earnings fell $196 million between periods. Lower volumes reduced earnings by 190 million, primarily due to planned maintenance at the Pascagoula, Mississippi and El Segundo, California refineries. First quarter 2013 was a particularly heavy refinery maintenance period for the company. Maintenance at both Pascagoula and El Segundo has now been successfully completed. We also reintroduced feedstock to our Richmond Refinery crude unit earlier this week and will continue bringing the Downstream conversion units to full capacity over the coming days. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $65 million. Seasonally weak demand particularly for gasoline combined with rising crude cost, pressured refining and marketing margins. The other bar reflects several miscellaneous items, including lower operating expenses, higher chemical earnings and the absence of year-end LIFO inventory drawdown benefits that were recognized last quarter. On slide 11, International Downstream earnings were $28 million lower this quarter. Lower volumes reduced earnings by $75 million primarily due to plant maintenance at the Burnaby, Canada and Cape Town, South Africa refineries. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $95 million reflecting lower transportation and environmental expenses. Foreign currency effects represented $175 million positive earnings variance between quarters. First quarters FX gain was about $75 million compared to a fourth quarter loss of $100 million. Gains on asset transactions were $135 million lower reflecting the absence of prior quarter asset sales. The other bar again reflects a number of unrelated items including lower shipping results, weaker lubricants margins and higher withholding and other tax related charges. Slide 12 covers all other. This segment broadly consists of corporate administrative functions our worldwide cash management and financing activities as well as our mining, power generation, real estate and energy technology and services businesses. First quarter net charges were $439 million compared to $538 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $99 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate charges resulted in $111 million benefit to earnings while corporate tax items were $12 million higher this quarter. With that I would now like to turn it back to, Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Now turning to slide 13, last month we held our annual security analyst meeting where we provided updates on our projects and future growth plan as well as our financial performance relative to our key competitors. We now have fully updated relative performance data in a couple of areas. Segment returns on capital employed and Upstream cash margins. First, our Upstream adjusted return on capital employed was 21.5% for 2012 and we can confirm this placed us in the number one position relative to our major piers for the second year in a row. We completed the restructuring of our Downstream business and our adjusted return on capital employed in 2012 improved again to over 18%. Here we rank a strong number two against our piers and we have been closing the gap versus the leader for each of the last five years. Slide 14 shows our updated Upstream cash margin comparison. We have led the pier group in Upstream realizations for several years a trend which continued in 2012, combined with our competitive cost structure and the quality of our portfolio we also continue to lead the pier group on unit cash margins. In fact our cash margin of just under $37 per barrel exceeded the average cash margin for our pier group by $11 per barrel or over 40%. This superior performance is a function of the quality of our assets as well as our strong execution capabilities. Turning to, slide 15. I would like to share some highlights of the strategic progress we made during the quarter. We announced successful well test results at St. Malo in the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico where oil flow rates while limited by testing equipment constraints exceeded 13,000 barrels per day. With new technology we saw drilling efficiencies and good reservoir stimulation and this board\u2019s well for improving the recovery and the economics on our existing and future Gulf of Mexico projects. The Big Foot haul has arrived in the Gulf of Mexico and the Jack/St. Malo haul is on its way. The picture is of the Jack haul being transported. We announced the signing of a binding long-term sales and purchase agreement with Chubu Electric to deliver one million tons per year of LNG from the Wheatstone Project. Our Wheatstone LNG project has over 80% of its off-take secured under long-term sales contracts. In the Downstream our new gas oil cracker achieved start-up making the Yeosu Refinery in South Korea the largest processor of heavy oil in that country. We continue to be successful with our exploration program with new discoveries at Coronado in the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico and in Australia\u2019s, Carnarvon Basin where we announced discoveries at Kentish Knock South and the Elfin-1 prospect. The Elfin-1 prospect is our 21st discovery since 2009. We added new offshore exploration acreage in both Morocco and China. We also reached an agreement to enter the Cooper Basin in Australia another early low cost entry opportunity focused on unconventional resources. And finally, we recently sanctioned the Moho Nord development located in the Republic of Congo, the largest ever oil and gas development in that country. I'd like to close by saying we're off to a great start in 2013. Earnings were strong. Upstream activity is on plan not only in terms of production, but also in terms of executing well against our major development project milestones. I encourage you to visit our investor website where we recently posted updated photos of our progress on our Gorgon and Wheatstone projects. We also continue to pursue future profitable growth opportunities, which will create additional value for our shareholders over time. Our healthy dividend growth pattern remains in place. This marks our 101st year of paying dividends and our 26th consecutive year of growing our annual dividend distributions. We continue to provide the strongest returns to shareholders offering a good balance between share price appreciations and dividend yield. We truly appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. I'd like to know open up the microphones for questions. We do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up if necessary. We'll certainly do our best to see that we get all your questions answered. Sean, please open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nEdward Westlake: Hi. Good morning, Pat. I've got a quick question on the tax rate, if I may. Obviously it dropped down to 39.3% and you flagged favorable tax rates in some of the commentary. Are there any sort of structural changes here in terms of shifts or is this just tax optimization in the quarter?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: There's nothing structural here, Ed. As you probably know that as certain projects mature and particularly as they get to the FID stage, it's not unusual to have certain tax impacts triggered by reaching that project milestone and that's really what we saw occurring here in the first quarter. That's what gave us a low effective tax rate in first quarter '13. We expect this to balance out over the end of the year. And so I think from a longer term perspective, thinking back to the 2012 effective tax rate, which is about 43%, that's a pretty reasonable place for you to peg the overall expectation for the year.\nEdward Westlake: Thanks, that's very helpful. And then just switching topics, on natural gas in the U.S., obviously a bit of benefit from Marcellus and Atlas over the last couple of quarters but the gas price, I guess it's rebounded a little bit. Should we expect that gas production probably turns down a little bit as it started to in the first quarter as you go through the balance of the year?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, I think what we have said in the past, we have really restricted all of our dry gas production to minimal amounts, principally in the Marcellus area. And of course, we're being helped there economically by the carry that it's still in place. All the rest of our gas production efforts really are geared towards heavy liquids concentration efforts. And so we should continue to see those ramp up.\nEdward Westlake: Okay, thanks, very helpful. Thanks very much.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thanks, Ed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.\nEvan Calio: Good morning, Pat and Jeff.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Evan.\nJeff Gustavson: Good morning.\nEvan Calio: Let me ask maybe a longer term question of how you think about the longer term CapEx and cash return strategy. And I ask in the context of my view Chevron's relative free cash flow inflection in 2014, '15 time period, as you begin to see the cash benefit of these relatively heavier and current period of capital investment. And the question hence becomes, do you believe that when you likely have incremental cash during this period, the cash returns to shareholders via buybacks or dividends increase or that you see additional reinvestment opportunities in the portfolio to maybe replicate this '14 to '17 growth period. How do you think about that?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Well, I would say broadly. I mean first of all, we believe the best way over time that we create value for our shareholders is by making the right investment choices. And if we have a strong queue, if we have projects that are very nicely attractive, nicely economic then obviously that's an important element for us. We have been in a stage where we have had very nicely attractive projects. And so that is really what has given rise to the heavy investment period of time. We do take our dividend commitment to our shareholders very, very seriously. That is the first priority of return of distributions to the shareholders. So you should expect that to continue to grow as long as earnings and cash flows continue to grow, and we of course are able to grow earnings and cash flows if we invest appropriately. So we work very harder trying to get that balance right between attractive projects for investment in the business and then also dividend distributions to the shareholders. If we get into periods of times where we have surplus cash, free cash flow beyond the C&E requirement, beyond the dividend requirement that\u2019s really what we pay to your share repurchase program to distribute. And we look at that every quarter, we evaluate what we think the kind of the medium term requirements for the firm are in terms of reinvestment, we obviously have a hypothesis about what our Board might do on dividends. We look at, what we think is happening from a commodity price standpoint and therefore what net generation into the firm might be and that's how we take our share repurchases. It is the most flexible element of our cash distribution formula.\nEvan Calio: I mean, then I understood, I mean, let me try may be what \u2013 kind of one different way and if I could, I mean, the percentage of CAPM that\u2019s invested in the project queue, that is not anything I need to know about today, is relatively higher than where its been historically. I think you gave a 35% number at the Analyst Day and I know there is lot of variabilities, but under current conditions would you expect that to normalize back into this -- 25% to 30% range, once you are exiting this kind of peak spending period through call them the 2015 timeframe? I will leave it at that. Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay and I think the best guidance I can give you on that would be to have you take a look at the duration of the investment cycles for some of the projects that we have underway. When you're talking about LNG projects, of course we have got Gorgon and Wheatstone underway, we have Kitimat, which is just in a very, very embryonic stage here, but those have very long investment cycle, 60 months plus. That's much different than what you would get in sort of the factory investment types of cycles that you might achieve and say a Permian ramp up for example. So, I think you need to look at the kinds of projects that we have in our queue and the overall investment cycle times for those projects in the queue. And that is going to give you an indication of how much pre-productive capital we might have built up on our balance sheet at any point of time. I did say back in March that our pre-productive capital was in the high 30s and that is an abnormally high level for us. And so all things being equal, once you get through the heavy spend period, we would expect that to come down as long as we don't have another set of projects moving forward. We do try to balance this all out and in the end I think we have certainly demonstrated a history of doing that being able to that successfully, because our project queue has been very economic and its producing the returns that we're benefiting from a cash flow standpoint and our investors are benefiting from a distribution standpoint.\nEvan Calio: Great, thanks. I appreciate it.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nArjun Murti: Thank you. Question on the Cooper Basin, when we were over in Perth last fall sometime, Chevron did not sound particularly excited about some of the East Coast LNG opportunities or stuff over in Queensland. Just curious whether this Cooper Basin entry signals any change to that view? Maybe I misread it.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: You know Arjun, I wouldn't read too much into them, and I think we were talking very broadly back in the fall and as a general rule as a Company we are always on the look out for what I will consider low-cost early entry opportunities, and that's really what the Cooper Basin represent. It's a very new play, I can\u2019t really indicate how that may in fact turn out for us, we just think it was an opportunity to expand our unconventional portfolio and there is an off a lot of work that will need to be done to evaluate the Basin. But we're hopeful that something could turn out there. I think you need to think of it as low-cost entry and very early in the evaluation phase.\nArjun Murti: Got it. That's helpful, Pat. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. Any update on the timing of Angola LNG start-up and Frade start-up? Thank you very much.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Sure. So on Angola LNG, our expectation is that we will have first LNG here in the second quarter. Assuming that happens, we would expect then to get to full capacity by year-end. And again, assuming that things move as we think they will, it's probably going to add to us about 20,000 barrels a day for the full year. Obviously that would just be a partial year contribution for us. It's worth about 60,000 barrels a day net to us once fully operational. From a Frade standpoint, we have received approval for a production restart for four wells basically, no injection activity. And that should be here in the second quarter as well. But it will be ramping up relatively slowly and so the contribution for the year will be relatively modest, only about 5,000 barrels a day.\nArjun Murti: That's great. Thank you so much.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your questions.\nPaul Sankey: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: Pat, just a quick one. Was there some tax changes in Kazakhstan as related to exports is the first one? And the bigger one which you may be able to answer or not is can you talk a little bit about the sensitivity of your CapEx levels to the dollar \u2013 to appreciation in the dollar? I assume an appreciating dollar would bring down your global CapEx. I wondered if you had a sense for sensitivities. Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. So the first answer no, the tax change didn\u2019t relate to Kazakhstan. And in terms of our capital program, we're really most sensitive to movement from a capital program standpoint to the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. And I think we've explained in the past that yes, it's been a component. We have had higher foreign exchange impacts that was part of the Gorgon cost increase up to $52 billion. About a third of that increase from the original FID number was related to foreign exchange effects, so that has impacted us there. This year it has really been much more modest than that. And as we said in the past, we haven't hedged against the Australian dollar or hedged the Gorgon or Wheatstone activities because usually the Australian dollar is moving with commodity prices and usually that means that we've got a natural hedge.\nPaul Sankey: Yeah, I was just kind of wondering because I guess it's the dollar strength and just globally it would tend to imply that the oil price will come down, but clearly what you're saying is the main sensitivity by far is the Aussie dollar.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: That's exactly right.\nPaul Sankey: Not some \u2013 for example, the euro wouldn't make a whole lot of difference either way.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Not from a C&E standpoint, no.\nPaul Sankey: By the way, going back to the first question that Kazakhstan had changed its exports tariffs. Was I wrong?\nJeff Gustavson: No, Paul. This is Jeff. That's correct. They did increase the export tax but our assets are not affected by the increase \u2013 our netbacks are not impacted.\nPaul Sankey: Thank you. That's perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your questions. Doug, your line is open. Could you try pressing your mute button?\nDouglas Leggate: I'm sorry, I had mute on. Good morning, everybody.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Hello, Doug.\nDouglas Leggate: Hi, Pat. We were looking forward a couple of years just some very substantial step-ups in production, but we don't really hear you talk much about portfolio high grading. Is that something that \u2013 you're very happy with the asset base you have now or is it an ongoing effort to pair, if you like, the bottom 10% in portfolio on a regular basis? And I've got a follow-up please.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I would say that we have a standard practice of pairing components of our portfolio and I'm speaking here about the Upstream, pairing components of our portfolio where we find that it's not going to continue to attract the capital that it needs to perform well where we feel others might find more value in that asset. So we will continue to do that pairing, I think about a year-and-a-half ago because I'm a little shy on the timing, but it's fourth quarter \u2013 last year I think it was \u201811, the Cook Inlet sale occurred. So, that\u2019s just a good example of continued pairing of the portfolio. I will say on balance we\u2019re very happy with our portfolio because you see it in our earnings margins and you see it in our cash margins. So, on balance we like the assets that we have, but having said that we obviously looked for opportunities to pair if we think the asset has more value to somebody else and it's not going to compete in our portfolio.\nDouglas Leggate: [Indiscernible) particularly material, how does that result a fair assessment?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I think that\u2019s true, that\u2019s fair. I mean, normally you can expect for the enterprise somewhere between $1 billion and $3 billion of asset sales in a given year. Over the last few years more recently we have had a little bit heavier restructuring occurring in our Downstream segment, and so that effort is largely behind us and so you wouldn\u2019t expect that continuing size to go forward in 2013.\nDouglas Leggate: Great. My follow-up is really \u2013 I guess it's kind of a related issue. We monitor your, if you like, cap rate on your Upstream business and for most of the last year, it was \u2013 I won't give numbers, but let's assume it was relatively low and in Q1, we have seen a big jump in your international margins relative to your weighted revenues, if you like. Has something changed there? Was it an absence of maintenance that\u2019s more sustainable going forward or to Paul\u2019s point has there been any kind of incremental tax changes that have led to that rebound. I am just trying to understand how sustainable this might be on a go-forward basis, because it was quite a significant number relative to what you were expecting?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: You\u2019re talking about our Upstream \u2026\nDouglas Leggate: International \u2013 international margins.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Upstream international margins, right. I think that it really, when you look at 2012, if you look at the whole quarterly pattern for 2012 had a significant deterioration in the third quarter really associated with the downtime at TCO. And now we have really just moved backup into what would be a more normal pattern. And that impact of the downturn in the third quarter and the re-ramping backup here in the fourth quarter you can see in last years results.\nDouglas Leggate: Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: We\u2019re back to a more normal position for us.\nDouglas Leggate: That\u2019s what I need. Thank you\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group. Please go ahead with your question.\nDouglas Terreson: Congratulations on your results everybody.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Thanks, Doug.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you.\nDouglas Terreson: Pat, I want to say -- if you\u2019d provide an update on the situation in Argentina and also the plan or next steps for Kurdistan for 2013, if there are any?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, well Argentina we continue to work with YPF on the Vaca Muerta discussion. We're hopeful that, that will be able to be concluded. So far we have drilled about three shale wells on our existing acreage and we\u2019re encouraged by the results that we have there. There are some above ground complications, I guess I would say that exists in Ecuador as they relate to Ecuador, and we need to have satisfactory resolution of those above ground complications before we proceed in a material way on Vaca Muerta.\nDouglas Terreson: Yeah. In fact could you just provide a little color on that point?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, well basically Ecuador has \u2026\nDouglas Terreson: You don\u2019t have to go that far back. Just kind of the next steps, I guess legally that you guys envision? Yeah.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: On the Ecuador \u2013 on the overall Ecuador case?\nDouglas Terreson: No, no. Just the Argentina component. I\u2019m sorry, yes.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: On Argentina. Argentina, okay. So right now there\u2019s a, I guess I would call it a partial freeze of assets in Ecuador.\nDouglas Terreson: Sure.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: It really hasn\u2019t impacted our liquidity in a substantial way. We\u2019ve been able to modify our liquidity provisions and so operationally we\u2019re in good shape. There is a freeze underway.\nDouglas Terreson: Right.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: We are basically petitioning to the Supreme Court in Argentina to have them review that case. I don\u2019t know when the Supreme Court may take it up or if they will take it up. We\u2019re certainly hopeful that they will take it up.\nDouglas Terreson: Okay.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: We don\u2019t believe that there is any merit to having the freeze in place. And we believe in a country that abides by the rule of law that kind of justice will prevail on this element as well.\nDouglas Terreson: Great. Thanks a lot.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.\nJason Gammel: Thank you. I just wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions on the exploration success in the quarter. First of all in Coronado, obviously in a pretty good neighborhood there. Can you talk about any follow-on drilling plans that you have? I believe that you're about to spud a sidetrack or maybe already have spud a sidetrack on the discovery well?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, not really sure what I want to be saying here on Coronado. I mean we do like the area. Let's see here\u2026\nJeff Gustavson: So we're still evaluating that \u2013 Jason, we have spud \u2013 a sidetrack on it.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: But there's not much more that we really want to say\u2026\nJeff Gustavson: Not right now, it's still under evaluation.\nJason Gammel: Okay, that's fine. And then maybe if I could just shift to the Australian exploration success. Obviously between drilling results and then the swap that you had with Shell for Carnarvon Basin versus Browse Basin, a quite a bit of incremental gas. Now you've talked about being able to move into a Gorgon feed for a training 4 relatively soon. But given the gas you've accumulated, when do you think you could actually start evaluating a training 3 at Wheatstone?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, I think that is more distant certainly. I think we need to get trains 1 and 2 up and moving forward. We're only the second year into that, the whole development construction phase here for Wheatstone. So I think it will come. It is a hugely prolific area, as you know, and with both the Kentish Knock and Elfin-1 prospects may just continue to add. And so the more that full region continues to add to our gas holding then it gives us more flexibility about which particular or gas molecule we send to which particular plant. So I think you should think of it as after discussions around training 4 for Gorgon.\nJason Gammel: Okay. That's helpful.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: And any further expansion of Wheatstone.\nJason Gammel: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with you questions.\nPaul Cheng: Hi, guys. Nigeria GTL, are we still on track for the year-end start-up? And based on your experience with the GTL, I presume that you're probably not interested in a GTL plan in the U.S. natural gas market?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: So with regard to EGTL, we're in the process here of commissioning the plant. It's a complex plant and the commissioning activity really go on for the bulk of this year, for the rest of this year. I would say we don't see \u2013 GTL will not rank high in terms of our project alternatives for U.S. natural gas.\nPaul Cheng: In Nigeria, Pat you're saying should be continued to be ramping up, is that any PSC you said related to Nigerian production or your just natural under 90 rate?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: No, there's no PSC of fracs there.\nJeff Gustavson: I'd say there are some cost recovery there, Paul. So investment levels were slightly lower because quarters since we had lower cost to our barrels.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: And that's really a timing issue not anything more sustaining than that, timing of investments and therefore the timing of cost recovery barrels.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Can I just maybe a real quick one for clarification. On the favorable tax impact for the international E&P, do you have an absolute dollar amount in the first quarter? You showed in the chart saying that sequentially it's a benefit of $214 million. What is the absolute dollar amount in the first quarter?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: We're not going to disclose that. Again, I think the important point about this is to understand that that was a timing event associated with moving some projects through various project milestones and the taxes that are triggered commensurate with that. For the overall year, you should think about the overall effective rate for the company of being in the low 40%.\nPaul Cheng: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions.\nFaisel Khan: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to actually get some clarification on the Downstream business. You guys mentioned a lot of sort of downtime between Pascagoula, El Segundo, Burnaby, South Africa, Richmond, the OC Refinery that's just all of that. Could you guys just let us know what was down and what\u2019s back up in its full production right now and maybe give us a little bit more detail on the upgrader here, which is so you\u2019re going to consume more heavy oil at Yeosu? And I just have a follow-up. Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. So I think, what we can say we really have said already. So El Segundo and Pascagoula are back at normal operating level. Richmond crude unit is just now taking FEED and we will continue to line that out over the next several days, so certainly as we progress through the quarter, you should expect that to be back to full operation. The downtime at the smaller refineries is same sort of circumstance has occurred. So, it was just a very heavy first quarter of maintenance period. You should expect the second quarter will be substantially back fully operational. We don't go into specific details about which units we have down at which plant, for which duration for commercial reasons and I'm sure you can appreciate that. And then in terms of South Korea here, we did have the new VGO FCC up and online with on-spec product during the first quarter. It's a 53,000 barrel a day plant; it does allow us to process heavier oil.\nFaisel Khan: Okay, got it. Perfect. And then my follow-up is on the Marcellus. Is there any chance you give us sort of how production has going for you in the Marcellus, last year and for this year. So you talked about it, I guess, in your prepared remarks, so just trying to understand how much growth you\u2019re seeing at that particular asset of yours?\nJeff Gustavson: So that \u2013 I will take that \u2013there has been production growth between year-on-year quarters and a lot of that\u2019s driven in the U.S. by both Marcellus and the Midcontinent for us which is respectably the Permian and some of the assets we picked up from Chesapeake later last year. So Marcellus continued these carry and continue to bring on production.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: And we would expect the Permian component to continue to grow during the year.\nFaisel Khan: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Asit Sen with Cowen Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nAsit Sen: Thank you. Good morning. Two quick questions, one with Brazil and one on Australia. Just a follow-on on Brazil, given Friday\u2019s start in second quarter and small contribution in 2013, how should we think about Papa Terra, still at 2013 start-up or slips into 2014?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. So \u2013 we really need to refer you to the operator on this, but the operators continues to have a 2013 start-up.\nAsit Sen: Okay. And then, secondly on Australia, a more strategic question, in a scenario were floating LNG becomes viable. How does it impact your thought process and future LNG trains that either Gorgon or Wheatstone, any early thoughts on that would be appreciated. Thank you.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. So, I think the floating LNG obviously is a technology that is still yet to be proven and my expectation will be over time that will prove out to be a development design that will be appropriate for certain types of reservoirs. In terms of Wheatstone and Gorgon, we\u2019re really in a position where we have invested already in the Greenfield and our best opportunity for further expansion obviously will be Brownfield. Brownfield as you know can be much more economic, particularly on the Downstream component of the plant, certainly we think may be 15% or so \u2013 15% to 20% more capital efficient on the Downstream side. So, we think the Brownfield expansion that we have at Gorgon and Wheatstone and given the resource size that we have at Gorgon and Wheatstone will allow those developments when the time is right to be attractive and competitive.\nAsit Sen: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.\nAllen Good: Good morning. I just wonder, if I get a follow-up on the Marcellus, I guess in March you announced you had the $850 million left on the drilling carries there and were running about eight rigs. At your current level, when would you expect to exhaust that drilling carry and when you do, would you imagine that you continue almost on with that eight rig drilling program or would you reduce the activity at that time?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. So the 850 is the number that we have at this particular point in time. We are not going to continue to provide interim updates on that. That really is a function of kind of the drilling program and the rate at which the investments occur. Our expectation really is and I think we've said this for some time here that our expectation is that the drilling carry works through a period of what I'll call relatively low US gas prices it allows us to understand the reservoir allow for kind of the build up the development plans for that basin and by the time the carry is over, it's our expectation that we would be sitting in a stronger US natural gas price environment. At the same time we've had good success and improving the economics of our drilling program in terms of cost per well the footprint per well and also the environmental impacts per well. So we're really pleased with the progress that we've been able to make and we're happy to have that carry and we'll continue to prosecute the plan over the next 12, 18, 24 months just as we have in the last couple of years.\nAllen Good: Okay. And I wondered if I could just get your update also on the acquisition front, obviously you did a deal with last year, a couple of years ago the Atlas deal. What's your view right now as far as evaluations are concerned in the US unconventional space whether it be natural gas and oil and how much opportunities do you see today relative to last year given I guess some of the oil prices and maybe some of the other evaluations of some of these small EMPs that are out there that may fit into your portfolio.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: And I think that I don't want to have a generic statement on this because I think it really does depend on the quality of the asset in the unconventional space. As we have no \u2013 as we've seen there's a big difference between sweet spot areas and non sweet spot areas and we continue to always be focused on the value proposition first and that really stems from the quality of the asset and in certain times here we have seen that the high quality assets have been very, very expensive and that our entry point was really too late. In other circumstances, we have found that for whatever reason in Chesapeake I think was a good example of this. There were certain circumstantial above ground issues that were face that we could get in and get a good value for that. Kitimat in the unconventional space we feel very pleased with having the opportunity to buy into that particular project. It's a tremendous resource space and we like the overall dynamics between the partners now. There's only two partners and we've got a good partner in Apache with a strong capability on the Upstream side. We obviously bring the Downstream side. So we tend to look at the overall project. And if we can find value in the overall project, we're going forward but it's not \u2013 there's not a blanket, gee, everything's overpriced or gee, everything's under priced right now. It's very resource specific and circumstantial specific.\nAllen Good: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a big picture question on your overseas unconventional, one of your European competitors recently made some very downbeat comments on shale development outside North America. You guys have been about as active as everyone in the cumulating acreage. I would just like to get your latest thoughts on that?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. Pavel, I think we have said that I know George has said that this is a long-term development opportunity and we have always had the expectation that it would take several years to understand what this play could develop into. You just don't have the same infrastructure in these European countries as you have in the US. You don't have the same knowledge of the reservoir. In the US of course the US have been drilled for decades and decades and there was an awful lot of reservoir knowledge that is not the case in Europe. In the US we have a lot of service providers and a lot of infrastructure. In Europe that is not the case. We have well established fiscal and political regimes here. As it relates to hydrocarbons, that's not always the case in Europe. And so there are a number of differences between the US environment and the European environment and so we have always thought that this would be a longer term development opportunity.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay. Just a quick one on Kitimat. Is it still your sense that you will only move forward with the project if you can get crude linked off take?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Our belief is that selling Kitimat gas into an Asian market will require, I guess I would say economic provisioning that will underpin the asset investment. And in our belief the best mechanism for doing that is the oil linked contract. So we believe that, that will continue to be the basis that will be needed to spur on the investment for new LNG developments like Kitimat.\nPavel Molchanov: All right. I appreciate it guys.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: I am showing one follow-up from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: Hey Pat, two quick one actually. One in page 10 of your presentation you show in the U.S. Downstream a negative bar of $190 million, and you\u2019re saying that primarily relate to the downtime. Is that just the, we take also that\u2019s including your estimate of the opportunity cost. And if you are not into the opportunity cost, do you have a rough estimate that how big that may be?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: No, I mean this is -- I mean, there\u2019s an analytical derivation to get to the volume bar and what we\u2019re really trying to say there is that, that compared to last quarter and the volumes that we had running through the equipment and the margins that were achieved back then relative to this quarter and the margins achieved this year we break that up between the volume and margin analysis here, various analysis. And that\u2019s really just trying to say that the primary driver for poor U.S. Downstream earnings really had to do with having so much of our equipment down, Pascagoula, Richmond, El Segundo.\nPaul Cheng: So that\u2019s the best estimated opportunity cost to you?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: No.\nPaul Cheng: That\u2019s fine. I'll just follow-up with, Jeff later on. A final one, at the end of the first quarter from an inventory level, do you roughly balance at a normal level or that you\u2019re under-levered or over-levered and do you have any under-lift or over-lift in the first quarter also?\nJohn S. Watson: We\u2019re slightly over lifted, but it's immaterial. It's less than half a percent in the first quarter.\nPaul Cheng: How about at the end of the quarter. Are you roughly balanced?\nJohn S. Watson: Well that is the end of the quarter.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: That is the end.\nPaul Cheng: Oh, that is the end. How about in the first quarter, did you have any over-lift or under-lift at all?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, like I said we were slightly over lifted, but less than a half a percent. So it's not material to our results.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: I\u2019m not showing any other questions. Thank you.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Then I\u2019d like to thank everybody for your participation here today, especially for the folks who asked the questions. With that again I\u2019ll reiterate my appreciation for your interest in the company, and I wish you well for the day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's first quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}], "2015": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2014, "date": "2015-01-30 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathon and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.\nJohn Watson: Well, thanks Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Gustavson, the General Manager of Investor Relations. We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on our Web site. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Turning to Slide 3, I'd like to highlight some of our key accomplishments for the year, starting with safety environmental performance. We had our best year ever and virtually every measure of personal safety, process safety and environmental performance. We expect to lead the industry again. Although commodities prices fell sharply late in the year, our overall financial performance was strong, upstream and downstream had solid years overall and both ended the year with very good reliability. We had excellent progress on our asset divestment program with significant well-timed upstream sales in Chad and in Canada and high valuation mid-stream transactions. In the first year of the program we finalized just under $6 billion in investments versus the $10 billion three year target for the period 2014 to 2016, we'll update this target at our March meeting. Looking at our downstream business, we completed important liability investments at several of our key refineries, which contributed to high utilization rates in the second half of the year. We became the world's largest premium base oil producer with the start-up of a 25,000 barrel per day plant at our Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery. We continued to make progress on our U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project through Chevron Phillips Chemical Company our 50% owned affiliate. It is now 50% complete. Moving to the upstream business, we started Jack/St. Malo which is ramping up ahead of plan and Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico. In Bangladesh we successfully expanded production at the Bibiyana field. On our LNG projects in Australia, Gorgon is now 90% complete, we're targeting first gas into the system around the middle of the year and first LNG sales this year. Wheatstone made excellent progress and it's 55% complete and on-track for late 2016 start-up. We've posted a number of photos highlighting our construction progress on these two important projects on our investor webpage. We progressed development of our shale and tight resource holdings, notably in the Permian. We had one of our best years from an exploration and resource capture standpoint with 35 discoveries at a 66% success rate. We added 1.4 billion oil equivalent barrels with significant conventional and unconventional adds. We had two potential hub class discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and we announced the transaction yesterday to consolidate holdings around one of them. Our one year reserve replacement ratio was 89% taking our five year replacement ratio to 96%. With that I'll turn it over to Pat, who'll take you through our financial results. Pat?\nPat Yarrington: All right, thanks John. Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance, the Company's fourth quarter earnings were $3.5 billion or $1.85 per diluted share. For the year earnings were 19.2 billion this equates to a $10.14 per diluted share. Return on capital employed was 11% and our debt ratio at year-end was 15%. 2014 marked the 27th consecutive that we\u2019ve increased our dividend payment. Given the change in market conditions, we are suspending our share repurchase program for 2015. Turning to Slide 5, cash generated from operations was 6.5 billion for the fourth quarter. For the full year, cash from operations totaled 31.5 billion. Cash capital expenditures were 9.7 billion for the quarter and 35.4 billion for the full year. At year end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled more than $13 billion giving us a net debt position of about 15 billion. Slide 6 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2014 earnings were approximately $1.5 billion lower than fourth quarter 2013 result. Upstream earnings decreased to 2.2 billion between quarters. Lower crude realizations and asset impairments driven by the sharp decline in crude oil prices during the second half of the year and higher DD&A charges were partially offset by higher gains on asset sales and lower exploration expenses. Downstream results increased by 1.1 billion driven by stronger international refining and marketing margins, higher gains on asset sales and favorable timing effects. The decrease in the other segment primarily reflected higher corporate charges and tax items. Turning to Slide 7, I'll now compare results for the fourth quarter of 2014 with the third quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter earnings were $2.1 billion lower than third quarter results. Upstream earnings decreased by approximately 2 billion reflecting lower realizations and asset impairments partially offset by higher gains on asset sales and more favorable foreign exchange effect. Downstream earnings increased by 130 million driven by favorable timing effects and gains on asset sales partially offset by higher operating expenses and a one-time economic buyout of a legacy pension obligation. The decrease in the other segment largely reflected higher corporate charges. Moving to Slide 8, our U.S. upstream earnings for both the fourth quarter were about 500 million lower than third quarter results. Lower liquids realizations decreased earnings by 600 million consistent with the approximate 25% decline in the U.S. liquids prices indicators between periods. The decline in prices also triggered impairments of several smaller assets which negatively affected earnings by 90 million. Higher gains on asset sales improved earnings by 160 million. The other bar reflects the number of unrelated items including unfavorable tax effects which were more than offset by the absence of the economic buyout of a long-term contractual transportation obligation in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 9, international upstream earnings were about 1.5 billion lower than last quarter's results. Lower crude oil prices negatively impacted earnings by $1.4 billion. Our average international crude oil realizations were down $25 per barrel between quarters consistent with the decline in Brent prices. The significant drop in prices triggered impairment for several late-in-life assets decreasing earnings by 570 million between periods. Higher operating cost reduced earnings by 110 million. Gains on asset sales increased earnings by 670 million, mainly driven by the farm-down of a 30% interest in our Duvernay shale interest in Canada as well as the sale of our upstream business in the Netherlands. Slide 10 summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2014. Net production increased by 14,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects start ups and growth from shale and tight resource developments contributed 13,000 barrels per day. Project start-ups included the expansion of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh as well as the start up of Tubular Bells and Jack/St. Malo in the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Jack/St. Malo achieved first production in December on-time and on-budget. Entitlement effects increased production by 13,000 barrels per day between the quarters. Lower crude prices increased volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts partially offset by lower cost recovery volumes. Higher plant turnaround activity at TCO's Tengiz SGI/SGP facility in Kazakhstan early in the quarter and turnaround activity in Thailand and in Australia decreased production by 19,000 barrels per day. Asset sales in the Netherlands, South Texas and Norway negatively affected production by 11,000 barrels per day between quarters. The increase of 18,000 barrels per day in the base business in other bar reflects primarily higher reliability from Tengiz following the previously mentioned turnarounds completed earlier in the quarter. Slide 11 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between 2014 and 2013. Net production declined by 26,000 barrels per day during 2014 compared to the prior year. Shale and tight production increased by 41,000 barrels per day driven primarily by growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian as well as the Vaca Muerta in Argentina. Ramp up associated with Papa-Terra in Brazil and the expansion of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh increased production by 13,000 barrels per day. Production entitlement effects decreased production by 14,000 barrels per day. Price effects were positive due to the decrease in crude oil prices of almost $10 per barrel between years. This were more than offset however by negative entitlement effects in Kazakhstan and lower cost recovery volumes in Bangladesh and Indonesia. Assets sales decreased production by 12,000 barrels a day due primarily to the sale of our Chad asset earlier in the year. The base business in other bar principally reflects normal field declines partially offset by base business investments in Nigeria, in the San Joaquin Valley and in the Gulf of Mexico. Our base business continues to perform well with a managed decline rate of less than 3% per year. Turning to Slide 12, U.S. downstream results increased $80 million between quarters. Realized margins decreased earnings by 190 million. Refining margins were weaker on both the West and the Gulf Coast as the decrease in product prices outpaced the decline in crude oil prices. This reflected abundant supply, high inventories and lower seasonal demand. Timing effects represented $195 million improvement in earnings between the quarters largely driven by year-end inventory effects and marking to market on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions. Higher gains on mid-stream asset sales improved earnings by 210 million. The other bar consists of several unrelated items mainly unfavorable tax effects and higher operating expenses primarily associated with planned shutdown activity. Turning to Slide 13, international downstream earnings increased by $51 million between quarters. Higher margins particularly in Asia increased earnings by 280 million. Refining margins benefited from falling crude prices while marketing margins were supported by favorable price lag effects for naphtha and jet fuel. Inventory effects represented $100 million improvement in earnings between quarters mostly reflecting favorable year-end LIFO impacts. A one-time charge related to the buyout of a legacy pension liability decreased earnings by 160 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency effects. With that I'll turn it back to John for a few comments on 2015.\nJohn Watson: Okay, thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 14, earlier today we announced the $35 billion capital program for 2015. This is $5 million or 13% lower than last year, excluding expenditures by affiliates the cash component of this program is 31 billion. This program is lower than we signaled last March and is responsive to current market conditions. It funds key projects where we've taken final investment decision and are already under construction. In the upstream this amount is approximately $14 billion representative of the dark blue on this chart. It includes monies for Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot and others. This category of spend will decline in the future as projects are completed. Base business and shale spending in medium blue on the chart is about 12 billion. A portion of this base business spend includes critical and maintenance reliability work which has limited flexibility. The majority of the base spend, including shale and tight is being screened at current prices. We have increasing flexibility in this component of spend as the year progresses. Spending on Pre-FID projects and exploration work is being high graded, paced and significantly reduced in response to market conditions. Downstream spending of $3 billion is limited to key projects under construction such as the Gulf Coast chemical project which by the way is 35% complete I think I said 50% earlier, 35% complete. And also the spending in the downstream is also limited to critical reliability and maintenance work. Turning to Slide 15 we've reduced our capital budget for the year conserving cash and preserving value. We also are reducing the costs of goods and services and operating expenses. We enter this period of lower prices with a very competitive cost structure. We routinely show you a chart that tracks total cost per barrel in our upstream business relative to our competitors. You've seen we are industry-leader and we have significant cost reduction efforts underway. This chart shows the IHS upstream cost index, industry costs have more than doubled in the last decade. Market conditions will create surplus capacity in most key supply chain categories and drive rates lower. We are actively engaged with all suppliers and have enjoyed early success. We expect the opportunity will grow with time and particularly so if prices remain low. We're also taking action to reduce internal costs. You may have seen press coverage of staffing adjustments in the UK and Pennsylvania. We have other reviews under way in multiple other operating and corporate units. Managing cost aggressively is not new to us Mike Wirth was quite successful in making significant reductions in the downstream in recent years and if you go back and look at our financial statements in 2008 and 2009, you'll see that we took operating and administrative cost down $4 billion or about 15% between years in response to that brief price excursion. We know how to manage costs. Our production guidance is the range of flat to 3% growth the uncertainty is the reflection of market conditions. I'll highlight several of those uncertainties. First, we've had great success in the base business area limiting decline in mature fields to 3% or less in many years. Our shale programs in the Permian and elsewhere continued, but I have indicated we're screening the spend at current prices. I have also indicated we're active in our efforts with vendors and suppliers to reduce costs. The uncertainty in prices and the costs of goods and services creates some uncertainty in the amount of base business investment and the decline rate and growth from our shale resources. Second, we've had success in our asset sale program. The full year effect of last year's sales reduces production 22,000 barrels a day from 2014. There is uncertainty in the timing and precise composition of this year's asset sale program creating uncertainty in the additional volume impact. Remember we're driven on all sales by value and this can influence timing. Finally, the contributions from major capital project ramp ups and start ups this year is significant but relatively small movement in the timing of deepwater development wells at Jack/St. Malo, Tubular Bells or Papa-Terra can make a significant difference in annual production. Similarly, small movements in restart dates for Angola LNG or start up of Gorgon and other new projects can cause variation. Finally, production sharing contract and other entitlement effects are sensitive to prices and spend levels. Our 3.1 million barrel a day target for 2017 remains on-track as the major projects under construction drive that outcome. That concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate your listening in this morning we're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan please open up the lines and we will take some questions. Question-and-Answer Session\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.\nJason Gammel: John, I just want to ask about taking FID in the current price environment. You spoke about how you were beginning to see cost savings from your providers and is that something where you would probably just try to delay making an FID to see how that type of negotiation goes with suppliers, or do you expect that you will actually have some fairly significant FIDs this year? And I am really thinking Tengiz\u2019s expansion as much as anything else here?\nJohn Watson: And I think that's the key one to focus on, if you look -- we have many projects that are in concept development and frontend engineering and design. And so the overall economics of some of them are impacted by the current price environment but the project at Tengiz is a good project and that project will ultimately go forward. And we've made significant progress and have good line up with our partners on that. But we're taking the opportunity in the current price environment to take a look at contracts, take a look at spend and see if we can bring costs down further. Now we have in the plan and expectation that we will take final investment decision later in the year in 2015. Other than that I can't think of too many significant projects where we're likely to take FID this year.\nJason Gammel: And then just as a follow-up, John do you have any deflation built into the capital budget for 2015 or is it all reduced activity levels?\nJohn Watson: Well it's a little bit of both Jason, we do have -- I think for example we've dropped over 20 rigs, which is about 15% of our worldwide rig count. So as I said we're screening projects based on the current level of prices if the return is near at hand. So if you have short cycle based business or shale investments and they don't meet investment hurdles at current prices which is the revenue you're likely to realize, we're pulling them from the program and we've cut rigs all over the world. Now many things continue to pass the hurdle and so we\u2019re continuing with our development. For example our work in the Permian passes is the hurdle. And so we're continuing that and have had good success. But we're also taking on costs in a fairly big way, if you look around the world. Rigs get a lot of attention, but that's actually not the biggest category of spend. EPC cost, well construction services, transportation, the fab yards are going to empty out here and rigs. We're taking on all of these things and we have a centralized procurement organization as well as a lot of people in our unit that are taking advantage of the opportunity in spare capacity and the supply chain. It varies considerably depending upon the category of spend that we're talking about and the precise timing. On rigs, we had one offer in one location around the world of a 50% reduction in rig rate. We've already captured retroactive January 1, rig reductions in some areas. So we're taking this on a big way and we have targets. We've baked in a little bit into our numbers but this is a very fast moving market and the longer this downturn persists the more we\u2019re likely to capture and the more it will be reflected in the major categories of spend like EPC cost and major fab yard spending that we might make on projects. Sure. Sir, Ed Westlake.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.\nEd Westlake: John, so I mean, just the high level picture and yes-no answer probably, has anything changed to your view that oil demand is growing? And has anything changed about the decline rates that you feel the industry has to overcome?\nJohn Watson: Yes. Overall the general picture that I've laid out here before and we've talked about is that, as long as the world economy grows, there's a reasonable correlation between world economic growth and growth in energy demand. If the world economy grows 3% to 4%, we tend to see 1% to 2% growth in energy consumption. In our view, maybe 1% for oil, 2% for gas over that time period, so that general picture hasn\u2019t changed. Now it can be influenced in the short run by macro events and prices and things of that sort. One of the things that we're trying to get a handle on and that others are looking at is how responsive will global demand be to the price reduction. If you look at some of those who follows very closely, they could see increases from 3,000 to 5,000 barrels a day from lower prices, but you've also got countries around the world that are reducing demand side subsidies and things of that sort. So it's a function of economics and it depends how long this persists. Truck sales in the U.S. are doing pretty well right now, so I think we get a bump from lower prices and I think we'll see growth of perhaps a 1 million barrels a day in demand worldwide in 2015, but that number can move around a little bit.\nEd Westlake: And then specifically Gorgon, you've kind of reiterated the timetable I mean can you give us any nuggets to give you confidence that we will get that first gas in Gorgon mid-year and the first LNG cargo this year?\nJohn Watson: Well I'd tell you that there's nothing at the higher priority for us right now than that Ed. And as I said we're 90% complete. We've got 8,000 people on the site right now, that's a little more than we might have thought in the past. We've brought in a bigger combination vessel and so we have put more people on site. We've made terrific progress on the upstream side basically all 18 wells have been drilled all upstream subsea infrastructure is in place, pipeline installation is complete. You can see a lot of this on the Web site, so those things are good. So we're working all those things really hard. We've got really mechanical electrical instrumentation work that's in high gear right now and we're basically milestone driven and commissioning and starting up systems right now. And that's really our focus. We're monitoring very closely contractor performance and productivity on the Island we're working with the unions on contracts and industrial relations. We've been able to manage through those things fairly well and we're planning for a flawless start up commissioning and start-up process. We've got risks of adverse weather that are there, but look we're shooting to get gas into the system in the middle of the year timeframe and get some cargos out this year. That's our focus. George and Jay Johnson are heading down there here in February so when we come back in March at the Analyst Meeting we'll have some very fresh information for you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please.\nAlastair Syme: Can I just come back to the chat on CapEx, I'm just trying to get a feel for how the different buckets of CapEx are moving year on year so the base business and the projects under construction, where the big revisions are?\nJohn Watson: Spending has come down $5 billion overall some of that is in LNG spend. It was a little over $10 billion in 2014 in total, it's a little over $8 billion planned in 2015, so that's a little bit of the spend. Deepwater spend is relatively flat. Shale and tight spend is a little bit higher, but some of our other base business spend is down. We've got about 10% to 15% reduction in exploration expense between years. And of course we also have those mid cycle projects those that are in concept design or engineering that there are fewer of those there's little less spend in those categories this year than in the past, so we're working very hard on all of those costs. And of course you may be asking about how do those categories look going forward? And we do expect growing flexibility in our spend as we move forward. One of the things we'll show you in March when we get there is that that bottom bar those projects under construction the $14 billion that number comes down in time. The LNG spend this year and next will continue to be significant, but as we get to 2017 it\u2019s under $100 billion, so I expect you'll see some reduction in that category. Now we may take FID on some projects, so you may have some additional spend in that category, but in principal there's a very high roll-off rate from that category of projects under construction. The base business spend is a function of both economics and how much we can wring out of the system from a cost point of view so there's activity and there is the cost of that activity and I commented on some of the sort of trends that we're seeing in that category. I will say exploration we're going to continue to explore. We had fabulous success particularly towards the end of 2014 in the Gulf of Mexico where the couple of discoveries and the transaction we had with a couple of other players in the business. So we'll continue to high grade that activity but we have growing flexibility in all categories is I guess the comment I\u2019d like to leave you with.\nAlastair Syme: Could you give us some sort of sense of about as you droll down that base versus payments in 2015, what impact that might have on underlying decline rates in the business?\nJohn Watson: Yes I think that it is a risk for the industry I think I've commented earlier I think that is a growing risk for the industry. If you go back to 2008 and 2009 period and this is a hard number to get at but we saw an increase worldwide in decline rates for all companies, basically for the entire industry. Increase by a 1% or 2% and that\u2019s very significant. We've done a good job of keeping decline rates to 3% or less I think we\u2019ve got a good chance to do that but obviously when you cut some rigs you have some risk of a higher decline rate in 2015 relative to past years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nEvan Calio: My question is just to follow-up on CapEx and I appreciate that it is a fluid process yet on your current guidance today, where do you expect the production impact? I mean it doesn't appear to impact the guide for 2015 at least in the high-end? I mean is it altering that 2017 guide or is it really much more long dated impact given being in a longer cycle time of a lot of your resource?\nJohn Watson: Yes Evan you just said the impact is predominantly over the longer term because we're continuing with the projects under construction and we're deferring some projects and spend that will have some impact on production but it's generally outside the window the window that we're talking about. For example the Tengiz project will be a good project but it\u2019s not going produce volumes inside the 2017 window. Similarly when you cut make reductions in exploration spend you're not going impact a production inside the window. So I would think of most of it as being a long dated impact.\nEvan Calio: And the 3%, the \u201915 production guidance, that's on current prices, I presume? Assuming no asset sales is I guess how I read the sensitivity. Obviously there is PSC effect there in asset sales? Is that correct? That is based on current prices, current strip?\nJohn Watson: It is I think it really governs the full range it's a pretty good range frankly normally we've given point estimates but there are a lot of moving categories this time. So it really encompasses the range of outcomes that are possible based on where we are today. For example as you point out at lower prices you do get a benefit in some of our PSC agreements from those lower prices where you spend money it takes more barrels to repay cost for example on cost barrels. But the flip side is that you may spend less and so there will be less to recover for example, we are reducing spend and have cut some rigs in Indonesia in response to economic. So you do have some offsets in these categories and of course depending upon when you make asset sales that has a direct impact on volumes.\nEvan Calio: And just a follow-up if I could, you mentioned you continue to monitor and be responsive to market conditions so I presume that further cuts would be responsive to a deterioration in market conditions. And then I guess you gave -- I like the classification on Slide 14. I guess how much of the $12 billion base is being spent in \u201915 on shorter cycle that may be more controllable if conditions warranted?\nJohn Watson: Well virtually everything in that category is shorter cycle activity there are some critical maintenance and reliability investments that we will continue to make same thing in the downstream. You need to keep your facilities running and in good shape. So there is a category that I would say is inflexible that is in the base business. Although the cost of delivering those goods and services may go down during the period, the activity itself will continue from an activity point of view as time goes by and rig contracts roll off we have growing flexibility in this category. I mean ultimately you have a great deal of flexibility in this category of spend. But as I say and we'll be responsive to market conditions and screen activity out if it doesn\u2019t meet our thresholds.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nRyan Todd: If I could follow-up with a question on pricing in the current environment, between the changes in the LNG market that we've seen in terms of where LNG is coming from in particular potentially a ramp in U.S. supply and then the reduction, the collapse that we've seen in oil price, are you seeing anything in potential LNG market pricing either for existing projects or for future projects, any change in the trends?\nJohn Watson: Any change in trends, well the trend has been a very fluid environment and a very frankly there has been a lot pressure on LNG pricing both in response to immediate conditions and response to the projects that have gone to FID around the world. So there is pressure on LNG markets. Notwithstanding that, we did signed a contract during this period that's an oil linked contract with a reputable company for a medium term slice of volume towards the end of the decade which gets us up into the range where we feel pretty good about the projects Gorgon and Wheatstone where we will basically be at our target for sales will be between 75% and 80% on Gorgon and 85% for Wheatstone. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good shape. We obviously need good contracts that to underpin new developments. So one of the projects that we\u2019re pacing until we can see conditions that will support a project is at Kitimat in Canada, we\u2019re continuing with some of the work we have underway to delineate the resource and reach agreements with First Nations people and permitting and things of that sort. But we\u2019re significantly pacing the spend of that project and we\u2019ll get alignment on it and have good alignment in early days with Woodside which is replaced Apache. Other than that I think there is, I think people are pretty cautious right now in the LNG market. Our view is it\u2019s not clear that all the Greenfield projects that are being contemplated can meet economic hurdles at some of the prices we\u2019re seeing. And demand is out there.\nRyan Todd: Maybe speaking of Kitimat, that's a good transition to a second question, which is from a high-level strategic view, when you look out from here over the next 10 years, has your view of the future changed at all in the sense that when you look back I guess over the last 10, are there projects, business models, efforts that have been part of your business model in the last five to 10 years that when you look forward over the next 10 you think just may not work anymore whether it's large-scale gas projects or oil sands or any type of -- I guess your views at high level on changes in the industry over the next 10 versus the last 10?\nJohn Watson: My basic view that in fact was referenced in the question which was asked earlier is energy demand continues to grow and if you look at the decline curve that\u2019s inherent in our business and let\u2019s talk about the oil side for a moment. Oil fields decline worldwide roughly 15% a year without investment. The industry works very hard with base business investments to attenuate that decline every year but still you do get declines of 3% to 5% industry-wide. So you need new oil fields to meet demand. The 3% to 5% decline on 90 plus million barrel a day base is significant. So you need investments in new fields and $50 does not support large new field developments and what I would call the big volumes that are going to contribute to meeting demand whether it\u2019s oil sands, deepwater aren\u2019t supportive of the 50 bucks. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing forward prices and most in the industry expecting to see some rebound in prices because we simply won\u2019t be able to support those projects at those kinds of prices. Now there in the short run when you have supply that is exceeding demand in our business short run supply and demand are not very responsive to prices so it takes that decline kicking in or action by OPEC or a stronger economic growth to close that gap and that\u2019s what it will be required here over the next period of time to get prices into a range where they can support the sorts of projects that you\u2019re referencing. Our view is those forces are at work right now and we can debate when that gap will close but the forces are working with every announcement of C&E cuts it\u2019s more likely to happen sooner. So my basic view is the world needs energy and the prices have to support the activity and of course we monitor the cost environment that we\u2019re in. We can see short run reductions in costs that can make projects more economic but in general the projects that are going to meet demand going forward are more complex than 20 or 30 years ago and so the cost of those projects will be higher and require higher price than we\u2019re seeing today to meet the volume targets. Probably a long explanation but that\u2019s how we think of it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.\nPaul Cheng: John, often times that risks also come opportunity and especially that you foresee maybe longer that potentially that you could have distressed assets out there in the U.S. and maybe also overseas. So from a high level, how do you guys look at under that circumstances I mean how much are you willing to use your balance sheet or perhaps that risk in your balance sheet a little bit and also that to use perhaps your currency not necessary at the best point that you want but will you be willing to also use it in a decent sized transaction?\nJohn Watson: Well, we -- old times Paul you and I've talked many times over the years, we're a depleting resource business, so we have to acquire leases discovered resource and frankly companies overtime. And we're very targeted in how we do that and we have tried to be commercially smart and take advantage of the opportunities when there's less competition for those assets. So we are actively screening the opportunities that are out there and we'll take advantage of opportunities that we see, I mean a one that's on the smaller end of the scale, but just a couple of days ago we did announce a consolidating transaction in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with a couple of partners. And we think we've acquired resource at a competitive cost relative to exploration costs and so -- and there are benefits to all parties from working to develop a common set of assets together in one hub, but that's -- so we do take a look at the opportunities that are before us. Now I have to tell you, our priority right now isn\u2019t acquisitions. Our priority at the moment is completing the projects that are under construction. And we do have balance sheet parameters that we work within to do that, but you point out on a relative basis, we've got a pretty good currency and we're mindful of the opportunities that's there.\nPaul Cheng: Can I just follow-on a quick question, that in your supply costs, any rough idea of what is the percent of your supply contract whether it is rig EPC, those have a duration longer than two years. So in other words what is the percentage of your cost base both in capital and operating costs that potentially we could see the benefit from the deflationary environment that expecting over the next 12 to 18 months?\nJohn Watson: We have a number of contracts that roll-off during that period. I would say by the time you get to 2017, almost all spend becomes variable if you will, so in fact a lot of it this year rolls off. Now we do have deepwater rig contracts that have been staggered and go out a few years. We do have fabrication contracts that have already been led they can go out several years, but the vast majority of the spend going forward if you look out to say 2017, the vast majority of that spend will be reflective of current market conditions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nPaul Sankey: John, from this level are you saying that you expect CapEx to go lower and do we now say that the 3.1 million barrel a day 2017 target for volumes is gone? And one query I would have about that is it was previously lowered because of an assumption that oil prices would be higher. If you recall your previous planning assumption had been I think $79 and it was the move up to a higher price that caused you to lower the target. Wouldn't that be a reverse effect down here? Thanks.\nJohn Watson: Yes well I did reaffirm the 3.1 in my comments earlier, so I have reaffirmed that target. And I will say there are quite a few moving parts in getting to the 3.1. First, most of the growth between now and then in underpinned by Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot, Mafumeira Sul and others that are under construction. And I've indicated we're continuing to fund that spending. We have had over the years some changes in the composition of the remainder of the volumes that contribute to the 3.1 for example, we've previously flagged in response to U.S. gas prices, we had reduced spend in that area. On the other side, the Permian wasn\u2019t in our plans when you go way back to 2010 and volumes coming from that area or higher. There has been a big change in prices and price effects as I indicated earlier can impact volumes. Other things being equal there is a contribution if we get to 2017 and prices are much lower, there will be a positive contribution that's inherent in that 3.1. The other side as I also commented is that we have fewer -- we have less impact from that, if our spend goes down in places like Indonesia and finally we have asset sales that can influence that target, but as we see it today with all those effects some that are positive some that are negative, we still see that 3.1 target.\nPaul Sankey: John, just I guess what I am driving at is that based on the 35 would you think you could come lower on the 35 billion of spending and still make the 3.1 and would you manage towards the 3.1, is that what you are saying because I guess you do have a view\u2026\nJohn Watson: No that's specifically not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that we have always -- the volume has always been an outcome. It's always been an outcome. We make decision based on economics. What I'm telling you is that I see the outcome being 3.1 because 80% to 90% of the volume increase between now and then are the projects that are under construction. And we make the investment decisions on our best view of go forward economics and in response to the best value propositions that we can see. The precise level of spend going forward the only thing I'll flag as you know I've been reticent to talk about C&E going forward and this last year is a perfect illustration as to why. We have a lot of moving parts many of which I have described. We also have currency movements and uncertainties, we have growing flexibility in our spend going forward. And if the kind of price environments we see the day persists you will see lower spending absolutely.\nPaul Sankey: I mean guess what I was driving at is that you had previously guided towards the flat CapEx from the previous 40 level in order to meet the 3.1. I think what you're now saying is you can still meet the 3.1 and we could even then still see lower CapEx again in meeting the 3.1. Or do I think about it that you are potentially not going to meet the 3.1 and bring down CapEx appropriately with the oil price?\nJohn Watson: I think the outcome is a function of spend that is largely already committed as one of the questions earlier commented is there much volume effect for some of the cuts most of the volume effect will be after 2017 because there are these longer cycle projects where we're taking a pause and trying to work the costs spend. So you know very well Paul we are in a long cycle business and so if you defer longer term projects now it will mean lower production than you might otherwise have seen beyond the target date of 2017. So there is an impact beyond 2017 of the decisions that we're making today but because we have all these projects in flight we don\u2019t see a significant impact to our target beyond the fact as I talked about before of base business spend, timing of asset sales and quantity of assets sales cost barrel effects and things of that sort.\nPaul Sankey: And a very quick one, could you indicate how high you think that can go in order to then allow you still to maintain your targeted credit rating? Thanks.\nJohn Watson: I'm going to let my CFO talk about the balance sheet and credit ratings.\nPat Yarrington: Yes, and Paul we have a lot of borrowing capacity still available to us we ended the year with a 15% debt ratio and there is a lot of appetite in the capital markets for our debt and under the scenarios that we're talking about here in this price range with this capital program we anticipate still being very nicely within the double A band and after you get through 2015 really and you look ahead obviously we're going see more production growth. John talked about the flexibility that we've got as time rolls on with our capital program we talked about and we do believe that there will some recovery in oil price we don\u2019t know at what level or exactly how quickly and there will be adjustments to our cost structure. So we feel very comfortable with the position that we're in and John referenced earlier managing within certain constraints and one of the balance sheet constraint is maintaining a strong AA.\nPaul Sankey: Is there a rule of thumb for how much that you can have and still be AA?\nPatYarrington: I don\u2019t think there is rule of thumb because the rating agencies take into account not only what your financial parameters are but also what's your operating parameters are and what's your prospects for future cash flow generation really are, so it's a combination of what the overall business plan so to speak for the enterprises if the rating agencies take into account. But suffice it to say we have incremental borrowing capacity of several-several 10s of billions of dollars there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh: First question is just kind of following up. In terms of trying to achieve dividend coverage and how you think about when you can get there full 100% dividend coverage, any color you can provide about how you kind of bridge to that? Because it looks like this year kind of the shortfall in the free cash flow and then the dividend, you add that up it's maybe $15 billion to $20 billion, so anything you could n provide around that. It sounds like operating costs you've highlighted maybe $4 billion of opportunity but just generally how you are thinking about that?\nJohn Watson: Sure, our plan is to cover the dividend in 2017. And we won't do it this year in all likelihood and in fact we flagged that if you go back two or three years or three to four years we have said in fact it was in response to questions around our balance sheet at that time where we had more cash than debt on the balance sheet and a lot of you were encouraging us to repurchase more shares and to really take advantage of the lower cost of debt and we said look our primary case may not be falling oil price. But we've got a lot of projects under construction and we're in a commodity business and we need to be able withstand the ups and downs of our business and so what I said at that time is that we would be restoring our balance sheet to something that might be a more normal level for AA credit rating as time goes by and these projects roll off. So when you get the reason I say 2017 is our production will grow between now and then by about 20% and so at whatever price level we're at we'll see benefits to free cash flow from that I have talked about the flexibility in the activity level that we have which can moderate spend and bring us back into balance. And then of course as you mentioned the cost reduction efforts that we have underway both in the supply chain and internally will help us attenuate that. Finally bridging us and helping us on the balance sheet are the contributions from assets sales and you saw we got off to a pretty good start in the program this year but we've flagged and indicated that even at higher price that we were going to use our balance sheet and we were going to use a little of it this year than perhaps would have been the case with higher prices but we\u2019re able to attenuate that over a couple of years.\nPhil Gresh: So just a clarification on that then, with the strip in the low 60s is it fair to say that your production growth later in the strip take out 4 billion cost you would actually plug the CapEx to get to a level that carries within that?\nJohn Watson: I\u2019m not going to give you a specific price forecast, I\u2019ll just say that the boundary conditions that we\u2019re operating under and these are things Pat has talked to you many times the boundary conditions, the dividend is the highest priority of spend for us and we want to keep sufficient flexibility on our balance sheet to withstand the ups and downs in the commodity market. So we will work very hard on CapEx and OpEx in order to get balanced in a couple of years.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. And just my follow-up question, is there anything in the production guidance for 2015 for Gorgon and for Angola LNG at this point or would execution on that timing wise be upside to the guidance just how to think about and the update on the Angola LNG in general?\nJohn Watson: Well, there is a scenario where we can be to the upside of the range that we\u2019ve indicated, but frankly I\u2019m a little gun-shy on that sort of thing given the kind of the operating environment that we\u2019re in right now given oil prices are and potential adjustments to spend. So yes, we expect to see volumes from those assets this year. The exact timing brings in some variability but our plan is to have both of those contributing volumes this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid from Bank of Montreal. Your question please.\nIain Reid: Just a question about your onshore drilling activity, you seem to be maintaining or increasing your drilling in the Permian whereas some of the other companies seem to be deferring it on the basis that it will be worth more in a couple years time by leaving it in the ground. Just kind of interested in your take on that versus what you are planning?\nJohn Watson: Well, we have about 30 rigs running in the Permian and we continue to screen the economics of both I think what I said is our spend on unconventionals will be, in shale will be higher this year than last. But that encompasses our worldwide activity that we expect to see. So we\u2019re still, by the way we\u2019ve had some terrific performance in the Permian, and part of the reason we\u2019re able to do that is we\u2019ve been able to dramatically reduce cost. When we get ahead to March at our Analyst Meeting we\u2019ll give you a fair amount of information on how we\u2019re doing some of the horizontal pad drilling programs that we\u2019re putting in place we\u2019re seeing very-very good early results. But we need to see good returns on these things to make investments. And so I\u2019ll just say we do expect some recovery in prices as the year moves on but if we end up in a depressed environment we can make adjustment to that. Remember a lot of our volume in that area, we benefit from no royalty and that\u2019s a big competitive advantage, as you get down where others might be at the margin more than we are. We\u2019re in pretty good shape because we don\u2019t have royalty and we\u2019ve got a long-long queue available to us.\nIain Reid: Okay, just one other thing, I heard what you said on Wheatstone in terms of schedule. I just wonder though where you are in terms of budget and CapEx. Is there any update you can give us on that relative to the original budget because we haven't had a project update for that one?\nJohn Watson: No, we\u2019re still operating under the current appropriation request that we approve which is the -- the Wheatstone project was a $29 billion U.S. project and we\u2019ve had some ups and downs frankly right now we\u2019re benefiting from currency movements if you -- the Australian dollar I think is around $0.78 so we\u2019re benefiting from that. We\u2019ve had some ups and downs there but -- and have used some of the contingency in the project but we\u2019re still operating within that same appropriation request.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: John, you've done a -- you've obviously got a tough job of trying to manage through the cycle and if you look at the near-term growth I think you've been pretty clear that that is pretty much prefunded with the commitments you've got going on. But once you get to 2017, once you've delivered your target, assuming an oil price range which is lower than we have had in the last five years, how do you think about the trade-off between continued growth versus other uses of cash like a return to buybacks? And what's on my mind is over the last 10 years before the growth phase, the share prices did just fine in a relatively flat production profile over that 10-year period? So that's my first question. I've got a related follow-up, please.\nJohn Watson: Well, I guess I\u2019d say volume has always been an outcome of our views about the quality of the investments that we available to us and that will continue to govern our decisions. If we wind up in a lower price environment in 2017 that we might have thought we would be in a year ago I think there will be contributing factors to that, one will be costs. And so, we don\u2019t make decisions to invest based on our volume target, we make decisions to invest based on our perception of the value that's available to us. There were confluents of events that resulted in several significant projects coming together at the same time. We had lease retention issues we had good gas contracts available to us for example on Wheatstone. We've had a moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico which is good things. And so -- and you had lease commitments and things of that sort, so you would not only choose to have all those projects be together, but we've felt individually they were good and we felt we had the capacity to handle them. And we're starting to see them deliver today and frankly if you look at our -- for all the talk about these projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone are 30 year to 40 year projects, and didn\u2019t come online yet. And when they come online and over the cycle, I'm very comfortable that the economics will be just fine and they'll be prolific contributors to the Company for years to come. And all these new projects also have follow-on opportunities to them, because we typically -- first phases of projects don\u2019t result in all the resource being developed and the incremental economics are better. Our priority around spend has been pretty clear. One, we're going to pay the dividend and we're going to increase it as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. And we'll invest to do that. And we'll do that within the parameters of our balance sheet. We have viewed share repurchases at the Flywheel and the Flywheel is -- was available to us. We have cautiously spread out share repurchases over time, so we've tried not to just be in for a short period of time, we were in for a longer period of time. But obviously with the price environment we're seeing, we're discontinuing that program. But if we get to a circumstance where we're generating cash flow, we don\u2019t see the opportunities we get no reticence at all to repurchase shares if we think that's a better opportunity for us.\nDoug Leggate: My follow-up, and I will be quick I realize we are at the top of the hour, but it's kind of more of a macro question. It's going to be a tough one to answer. But when we think about Chevron's role as a global player, 1.9 million barrels a day of oil and the operated obviously is a lot bigger than that, do you think that Chevron has been representative of big oil and non-OPEC, meets a certain oil price environment to maintain flat production, what would that number be for Chevron? In other words to hold production flat close to the start-up of the major projects, can you hold flat at 50 or 60 or 70? What do you think that number is now? I will leave it there.\nJohn Watson: Well Doug you're right it is a tough question. If we're in a $50 world, there will not be -- just as I said at a macro level around the world I don\u2019t see many investments that are going to go with the fiscal terms we see in place today with the cost levels we see today. I see very few major oil projects going forward. There will be incremental investments on existing projects to mitigate the decline there will be some shale investments that maybe economic, but I don\u2019t know for example around the world of full cycle of economics deepwater projects that go at $50 at the current cost structure. I don\u2019t know of new oil sands volumes that can come on at $50 and there are oil fields in decline everywhere so I just don\u2019t see that. Now cost can adjust, fiscal terms can adjust and so it's hard to speak definitively for a very long period of time, but it is very clear that the incremental barrels are coming from more complex developments overtime. With all the enthusiasm around shale I think it's important to remember it's 4 million barrels a day out of a 92 million barrel base. And you're going to see the rate of growth in that volume was due to slow and you're going to see a reduction in that rate of growth in response to current prices. I think we're at the end of our time I thank you very much for the questions. That -- and in closing we\u2019d just say we appreciate everyone's participation. I especially want to thank the analysts on behalf of all participants. We look forward to seeing you at our March Security Analyst Meeting, so Jonathan thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And thank you ladies gentlemen. This does conclude Chevron's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-10-31 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPat Yarrington: Hey. Good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jeff Shellebarger, President, Chevron North America Exploration and Production; and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement show here on slide two. Turning to slide three, the company\u2019s third quarter earnings were $5.6 billion or $2.95 per diluted share. On a year-to-day basis, earnings were $15.8 million or $8.29 per diluted share. Included in this quarter's earnings were gains on asset sales of approximately $420 million and foreign exchange gains of $366 million and a non-recurring economic buyout of a long-term contract. Taken together, this equate to a positive $0.34 per share. On the year-to-day, the impact of foreign exchange movement is minimal, while asset sales gains and other non-recurring charges have provided a net boost to 2014 earnings of $770 million. There is a full reconciliation of these items on our last slide. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 12% and our debt ratio at the end of September was 14%. We repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares during the third quarter and in the fourth quarter we expect to repurchase the same amount. Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $8.7 billion during the third quarter and $25 billion year-to-date. Cash, capital expenditures were $8.3 billion for the quarter and $25.7 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion and year-to-date $1.9 billion. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $14.5 billion, giving us a net debt position of $11 billion. Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2014 earnings were $643 million higher than third quarter 2013 results. Foreign exchange movements positively affected earnings by $366 million during the quarter, representing a swing of over $600 million between periods, mostly occurring in the Upstream segment. As a reminder, foreign exchange movements for us are largely book translation effects with minimal cash flow impact. Upstream earnings decreased by $443 million between quarters. Lower realizations and liftings, and higher operating and DD&A expenses were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange movements and lower exploration expenses. Downstream results increased by about a $1 billion, driven by stronger U.S. refining and marketing results, larger gains on asset sales, favorable foreign exchange movements and timing effects related to revaluation of inventory in a lower price environment. The improvement in the other segment primarily reflects the absence of the 2013 third quarter impairment of a power-related equity affiliate. Turning to slide six, I\u2019ll now compare results for the third quarter of 2014 with the second quarter of 2014. Third quarter earnings were approximately $70 million lower than second quarter results. Again, the earnings variance between quarters reflected a $600 million favorable movement in foreign exchange effects, most of which impacted the Upstream segment. Upstream earnings decreased by $615 million, reflecting lower realizations and lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange swing between quarters and lower exploration expenses. Downstream earnings increased by almost $670 million, driven by stronger R&M results, higher gains on asset sales and a positive swing in foreign exchange between quarters, partially offset by lower chemical earnings. The decrease in the other segment largely reflects corporate tax items and higher environmental expenses. Jeff Gustavson will now take us to the comparisons by segment.\nJeff Gustavson: Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide seven, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the quarter were $125 million lower than second quarter results. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $175 million consistent with the decline in U.S. liquids and natural gas price indicators. Higher production volumes in San Joaquin Valley in the Permian Basin increased earnings by $40 million. Lower exploration expenses, primarily associated with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico increased earnings by $95 million. The other bar reflects the number of unrelated items. Lower operating expenses were more than offset by the negative impact from the economic buyout of a long-term contractual obligation. Turning to slide eight. International Upstream earnings were $490 million lower than last quarter's results. Lower crude low realizations decreased earnings by $420 million, consistent with the decline in international crude prices between quarters. Lower liftings primarily related to the sale of our Upstream interest in Chad decreased earnings by $95 million. Gains on asset sales were $430 million lower, also driven by the sale of our interest in Chad and Cameroon, which occurred during the second quarter. Favorable movements in foreign currency FX increased earnings by $490 million. The third quarter had a gain of about $340 million compared to a loss of about $150 million in the second quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including lower trading results and higher DD&A partially offset by lower exploration expenses. Slide nine summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter 2014 and the second quarter 2014. Production increased by 23,000 barrels per day between quarters. Shale and tight resources growth contributed 18,000 barrels per day driven primarily by production increases from the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian where new wells were brought online. The net impact of lower turnaround activity during the quarter increased production by 23,000 barrels per day. Planned maintenance at TCO\u2019s KTL facility in Kazakhstan, in addition to Australia, was completed in the second quarter while third quarter planned turnarounds including TCO\u2019s SGI, SGP facility in U.K. and Thailand were on balance less extensive than the prior quarter. TCO, SGI, SGP turnaround continued through October. Asset sales reduced production by 18,000 barrels per day, principally due to the sale of producing assets in Chad. As a reminder, the production impact associated with this sale had already been incorporated in both our updated production guidance for 2014, as well as in our 2017 production target of 3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter 2014 and the third quarter 2013. Production was 17,000 barrels per day lower than the same period a year ago. Excluding production entitlement effects and the production impact associated with asset sales, production grew by 31,000 barrels per day between periods. Unconventional production increased in the Permian, in the Vaca Muerta, in Argentina by 40,000 barrels per day. Lower turnaround activity mainly in Trinidad and Tobago, Kazakhstan and the Gulf of Mexico increased production by 19,000 barrels per day. Production entitlement effects decreased production by 28,000 barrels per day. The decrease in crude oil prices between periods resulted in a small increase in net production volumes primarily as a function of our production sharing contracts in Indonesia. This increase was more than offset, however, by negative production entitlement effects in Kazakhstan as well as lower cost recovery volumes due to changes in absolute spending levels. The sale of producing assets mainly in Chad reduced production by about 20,000 barrels per day. The base business in other bar principally reflects normal field declines with a partial offset from the absence of external constraints, which negatively impacted production in the third quarter of 2013. Our base business continues to perform well with a base decline rate of less than 3% per year. Turning to slide 11. U.S. Downstream results increased $292 million between quarters. Higher volumes increased earnings by $160 million primarily reflecting the completion of planned turnaround activities at the El Segundo, California refinery where four new coke drums were installed. These new coke drums are expected to enhance the future reliability of the refinery. Despite declining industry refining margins on both the West Coast and Gulf Coast, our realized margins were $30 million higher. Overall, we benefited from more optimal sourcing of intermediates and other feedstocks following the completion of the El Segundo refinery's major turnaround in the prior quarter. In addition, we had improved reliability at both the Pascagoula, Mississippi and Richmond, California refineries. Pascagoula\u2019s refinery contributed a full quarter of premium base oils production, after the successful startup of its new premium base-oils plant in July. This benefited both volumes and margins. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $110 million due to the absence of cost related to the shutdown and maintenance activities in the prior quarter. Higher gains on midstream asset sales, mainly the sale of a terminal in Beaumont, Texas, improved earnings by $115 million between the periods. Lower chemicals results along with various smaller items decreased earnings by $123 million. Chemicals earnings were affected by various impairments in addition to the Port Arthur, Texas facility being offline since early third quarter. Turning to slide 12, international Downstream earnings increased $374 million between quarters. Stronger margins increased earnings by $145 million. Falling crude prices contributed to improved refining margins across multiple refineries, in addition to the completion of plan turnarounds at our Thailand and South Korea affiliate refineries. Asia marketing margins benefited from favorable aviation price lag effects and improved retail margins. Timing effects represented a $70 million positive earnings variance between quarters, largely due to the revaluation of inventory associated with falling crude and product prices during the third quarter. Foreign exchange gains were $105 million higher compared to the prior quarter. The third quarter had a gain of about $20 million, compared to a loss of about $85 million in the second quarter. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items, mainly higher trading results. Jeff will now provide an update on our North America Upstream operations.\nJeff Shellebarger: Thank you, Jeff. It\u2019s a pleasure to be on the call with you all today. I'll provide a brief overview of our North America Upstream operations, followed by a more detailed review of two key areas for us -- the Gulf of Mexico deepwater and our unconventional activities, particularly those in the Permian basin. The photo on slide 13 shows the Jack/St. Malo facility\u2019s safely mode on-location in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We continue to make steady progress towards first oil later this year. Let\u2019s turn to slide 14. Let me start by providing a brief overview of Chevron\u2019s North America Exploration and Production Company, where diverse organization made up of six business units were active in the key hydrocarbon basin across the continent. Production has averaged 731,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Year-to-date 2014, this represents almost 30% of Chevron\u2019s total Upstream volumes. The heart of our portfolio is our legacy based business, which has generated production, value creation for decades. Asset includes our Gulf of Mexico shelf, Mid-Continent conventional oil and gas operation in the San Joaquin Valley in California, where our industry-leading expertise\u2019s input operations has helped us achieve more than 50% recovery at the Kern River oilfield. These robust based business assets provide a low decline high-cash generation foundation to underpin and support our current and future growth opportunities. Next, I would like to highlight two of these areas in more detail -- deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our shale and tight assets. Slide 15, Chevron has a leading position in the Gulf of Mexico. We are the largest leaseholder. We currently produce about 200,000 barrels a day in the Gulf, slightly more than half of which comes from our existing deepwater assets. In the deepwater, we're making good progress on our major capital projects. Tubular Bells, first oil is eminent in the next few days. The remaining work on Jack/St. Malo is progressing well and the project remains on track for a late fourth quarter startup. Overall, hook-up and commissioning is about 90% complete, buyback gas was bought on board the facility last weekend. We recently completed dewatering the oil export pipeline both of these are significant milestones. Construction of the Big Foot tension leg platform is essentially complete and is ready for sail-away and offshore installations. The Central Gulf of Mexico has currently experienced a significant Loop Current event. These strong currents at the ocean surface are naturally occurring typically last one to three-months. This Loop Current is particularly strong and we are monitoring for the conditions that will allow us to proceed with installation, once the Loop Current subsides. We\u2019ve taken advantage of the extra time in the construction yard to start some pre-commissioning activities normally done offshore. Finally, investment decision was announced on the Stampede project earlier this week. On the exploration front, we recently announced the significant Lower Tertiary discovery at the Guadalupe prospect in Northern Keathley Canyon. We have also completed appraisal work at the Buckskin and Moccasin prospects and expect to move into front-end engineering and design in 2015. We have got five deepwater drill ships operating in the Gulf, two of which are focused on exploration activities, where we plan to drill four to six Impact prospects over the next 12 to 18 months. Next let\u2019s talk about shale and tight activities on slide 16. In the Permian Basin, Chevron has been active since the 20s. We continue to be a leading producer in the basin. We have an enviable acreage position. We have good exposure to the key sweet spots in the basin. Our legacy position provides critical access to infrastructure. We are employing a disciplined, value focused development strategy in the Permian. We are not in a drill or drop situation, and our low lease holding costs allow us to focus on the highest return projects in a paced matter while leveraging industry learnings. Our efforts on lowering cost while simultaneously increasing production rates and ultimate recoveries are helping to improve overall well and program economics. Finally, we've executed joint development agreements, which help optimize well placement and lateral lengths as well ensure the efficient build out of takeaway and other infrastructure. Already high level of activities in the basin continued to increase and the efficiency programs to lower cost increase EUR are working. We are anticipating that our 2014 unconventional production will be more than 10% higher than initially forecast and our long-term unconventional production growth continues to steepen, as shown on the chart on the right. We will provide an updated production forecast at our Analyst Day in March. Slide 17. Looking into the Midland Basin, production has increased by 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 40% during the first nine months of the year and we are on track to drill 10% more wells than originally planned for the year. As we mentioned during the second quarter call, we are transitioning towards a multi-well pad based horizontal program. The Midland vertical wells have demonstrated that all of the identified benches are potentially productive. Our Bradford Ranch program on the southwestern edge of the basin is a great example of our transition to horizontals. We have drilled our first two wells. We are now batch drilling the next four. The first well has been completed, it\u2019s flowing back and will be on production next month. At its full potential, we expect up to 150 wells on this development with lateral lengths ranging from 5000 to 7500 feet. We believe that we are well-positioned in what looks like the sweet spot at the Midland Basin horizontal play. Slide 18. Results from the Delaware Basin have been equally positive. Our two nonoperated joint development areas in Culberson and Eddy counties continued to deliver excellent results. Production has increased by approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 60% during the first nine months of the year and we are planning to drill 180 wells in 2014. Our company operated Salado Draw horizontal program in Lea County, New Mexico remains on track to spud its first well within the next month. While there are multiple benches in this area, we are targeting the Upper Avalon with its initial 16 well development. With success we envision more than 60 well locations at Salado Draw. Our recent well results give us continued optimism on the growth potential in the Delaware. Wells drilled in the third quarter have 30-day IPs that averaged just over 1000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. I would like to close by providing an update on some of our other key North American shale and tight assets. Let\u2019s turn to the slide 19. Starting with the Duvernay in Canada, we recently announced the sell down of 30% of our Duvernay position to Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company consistent with our risk management practices for early life assets. They are valued partner in our Wheatstone Project and we welcome them to this exciting development. The consideration received reflects the prospectivity and inherent value of our attractive acreage position, 90% of which is in a liquids rich window. Appraisal drilling has commenced on our first two horizontal well pads located in what we call the Central Focus Area. In the Utica and Marcellus, we have prioritized our near-term efforts into five core development areas across West Virginia and Southwestern Pennsylvania. As we move more aggressively into the development mode, pad drilling, optimization of lateral lengths and completion, and the build out of water infrastructure allow us to further lower cost, increase recoveries, and therefore enhance our overall development economics. Let me turn it back over to Pat.\nPat Yarrington: Okay. Thank you, Jeff. In addition to the significant amount of activity going on in our North America Upstream business, I would also like to touch on a few other highlights during the quarter. In Australia, we continue to make good progress on both the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects. For Gorgon, which is now 87% complete, all of the development wells have been successfully drilled and majority are through the completion phase. LNG Tank #1 is through construction and testing, awaiting product and LNG Tank #2 is on plan to achieve that same status by the end of January. The five turbine generators are all installed and the jetty is essentially complete. 11 of 17 Train 2 modules have been received and installed. The key focus in the months ahead remains in the mechanical, electrical and instrumentation work scope on the island. The Wheatstone project is now 49% complete. The project team had a major milestone back in August, with the installation of the offshore steel gravity-based structure. The MOF or materials offloading facility is 100% operational. The Upstream drilling campaign, the fabrication of the platform, site preparation and construction of the LNG tanks are all on schedule. We are making good progress, bringing these projects online, both of which will be important contributors to production, cash flow and earnings for decades to come. I encourage you to review the new pictures that show progress on both projects on our investor page at chevron.com. In Bangladesh we achieved startup at the Bibiyana Expansion Project, which includes two new processing trains, with an incremental design capacity of 300 million cubic feet of natural gas and 4,000 barrels of condensate per day. Moving to the Downstream, we have completed investments at several of our U.S. refineries, including El Segundo, Pascagoula and Salt Lake City. We expect these investments will lead to notable reliability and operational improvements going forward, some of which were evident in the third quarters result. Our Chevron Phillips Chemical\u2019s joint venture also continues to make good progress on its U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, construction of the 1.5 million metric ton ethane cracker and the two 5,000 metric ton polyethylene units is almost 25% complete. It is on schedule and on budget. Finally, we continue to sell non-strategic assets. We\u2019re on target for achieving $10 million in asset sale proceeds from 2014 through 2016, a goal we outlined at our Analyst Day meeting last March. At nine-month, year-to-date proceeds amount to $2.6 billion and our several other transactions lined up to close in the fourth quarter or early in the New Year. I\u2019d like to close with a couple of thoughts about Chevron position and outlook, given recent commodity price decline. Our priorities haven\u2019t changed. By necessity, we take a long-term view of prices, because our investments last for decade. We continue to believe global demand for oil and natural gas will grow, while existing sources of supply will inevitably decline. And as it is always done, although, with some lag, we expect the industry cost structure will align to the revenue stream, such that economic incentives will exist to invest in developing new energy supplies. Our strategies have remained and will remain constant. They are designed for long-term value creation. Our financial priorities haven't changed. They start with growing an attractive dividend. Next we look to invest in economic projects that create value and allow us to sustain and grow the dividend for years to come. Third, we want to maintain a strong balance sheet, precisely for times like this. And finally, any available cash is distributed to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. Our program is scalable and could be adjusted in a period of low prices. We\u2019ll continue to make that assessment each quarter and our future actions will obviously be influenced by how low prices stay and for how long. We remain focused on excellent execution each day and every day. Our businesses are performing well. Based on preliminary information, it appears our Upstream and our Downstream segments were number one in earnings per barrel for the quarter. Now, of course, we are cognizant of near-term price realities. Major payout -- capital projects under construction and other nondiscretionary spend represents about one-half of our current capital budget. Even at low prices, we plan to continue funding these projects, key among these are Gorgon, Wheatstone and our two operated deepwater projects. Within a year, we expect to see production from three of these four projects online and they\u2019ll turn from being cash consumers into cash generators. After that we prioritize and rank our remaining investments, that are more discretionary in nature, only funding those that are most competitive in the portfolio or where deferral can be achieved without economic loss. Permian development, for example, remains quite attractive even at lower prices. Now this ranking and prioritization is not a new process for us, it\u2019s a routine process for us. We are also keenly focused on managing operating cost. This too is not a new area of effort for us since oil prices have been drifting south for the past few years while costs have continued to rise. As we showed you last March, our costs are already highly competitive with our larger peers as well as a much broader set of E&P companies. Well before the recent price decline, several of our international and domestic business units, as well as our corporate departments already had notable cost reduction efforts underway. Finally, we plan to continue, but we will be careful about managing our ongoing asset divestment and portfolio rationalization efforts. The valuations for some assets targeted for sale are not likely to be affected by near-term circumstances, but the valuations for other prospective sale assets maybe. In all cases, we will only sale if we can capture good value. By the end of 2014, we should be well on our way to our $10 billion asset divestment target. We still have confidence in achieving it between now and the end of 2016. We have a great deal of experience and managing through prior price cycles in both our Upstream and Downstream businesses, and we feel confident in our ability to allocate capital appropriately and to sustain a competitive cost structure even in a lower commodity price world. Now that concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in this morning. We are ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if that\u2019s absolutely necessary and we\u2019ll do our very best to get all the questions answered. So Jonathan, please open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nJason Smith: Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Jason Smith on for Doug. How are you?\nPat Yarrington: Oh, fine, Jason, how are you?\nJason Smith: Good. So Pat, I think in your comments around some of the projects you had looked to move forward in the future, one of ones you didn't mention is the Tengiz expansion and there has obviously been some chatter around costs and timing there. Can you maybe just offer some color on your latest thoughts on whether this moves forward?\nPat Yarrington: Yeah. So, I mean, obviously, this is a very attractive asset for us. It\u2019s one of the critical assets that we\u2019ve got in the company, strong earnings, strong cash flow and it has the potential we think to grow even further. There are two perspective elements of that project that I think are important to separate out. One is the Wellhead Pressure Management Project. It's really designed to keep existing capacity -- processing capacity full. And the second is a project for the growth that really could add 250,000 to 300,000 barrels a day, taking full field growth production up to around 1 million barrels a day. So it's a very exciting project. We are working very aggressively with our partners and with the government -- the Kazakhstan government to progress this project through to final investment decision. We have not made a final investment decision at this point in time. We don't have a cost estimate. Our teams are working very hard to conclude the final engineering, understand the full suite of the economic impacts here, get complete alignment between our partners and the government and proceed that forward. When we do take FID, we will have a number that we can put forward.\nJason Smith: Got it, okay. And then we appreciate all the thoughts on buybacks and dividends going forward, but in the current oil price environment at least at present it looks like cash flow is not covering CapEx dividends and buybacks for the first nine months of the year. So if we do end up in a depressed environment, can you maybe just talk through what changes there?\nPat Yarrington: Yeah. So I think Jason, it\u2019s really going to depend on the outlook that we\u2019ve got on a whole series of parameters, oil prices one, cost structure is another, length of duration of any sort of BIP or price excursion, how quickly we see the cost structure amending to that. Our capital program, balance sheet health issues, etc era and all of that gets taken into account when we look at our allocation of our cash uses. The priority, as I\u2019ve said before and we\u2019ve been long-standing in saying this is really about being able to grow our dividend. But in order to do that over a long period of time, we need to make -- continue to make very strong investments or investments in strong projects, attractive projects. We\u2019ve got a tremendous Q and we have the opportunity to do that. So we are going to be driven by the economics of the portfolio that we have at hand. We\u2019re very cognizant of the risk in our business, the commodity price cycle risk and we\u2019ve long-standing kept a pristine balance sheet to weather through positions just like this. We have a lot of borrowing capacity still ahead of us without putting into jeopardy our AA status. And we are on the cusp of getting to the point where these major capital project kick in with significant volumes and significant cash generation. So we feel very comfortable about the position that we are in and we are not bothered in a temporary sense of having to fund our shareholder distributions off of our balance sheet. We obviously can't do that for a long period of time but that is not the window that we find ourselves in.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please?\nJason Gammel: Thanks very much. My question is on the Permian. Jeff, I was hoping that you might be able to at least qualitatively explain why you are seeing such a significant increase in the production levels. And I guess if you'd just break it out between moving to longer laterals, the intensity of proppant in your completions, or even just higher activity levels or maybe just something else I am not thinking about.\nJeff Shellebarger: Thanks for the question, Jason. It\u2019s really all of the above. Maybe start back with a year ago, a lot of our activity was focused on appraisal and we had some lease tenure work to do up in the Delaware with the Chesapeake acquisition. Most of that work is done. That\u2019s helped us identify the sweet spots that we want to be in. As you know, the industry is innovating every single day on completions and designs. So we are adopting those designs, the pioneers to our business. So lateral lengths are increasing, stages in those lateral lengths are increasing, propane amounts are increasing. All of that is driving, not only our performance for a while but the entire industry\u2019s performance for a while in an upward direction. And then finally on top of that, our activity in general with more development program has increased year-over-year and that\u2019s driving the production growth.\nJason Gammel: Great. And I really did have a true follow-up on this one. I think you said that the 30-day IP in the Delaware Basin was just over 1,000 barrels a day. You may have said it but I missed it, do you have a similar figure for the Midland Basin?\nJeff Shellebarger: No, I don\u2019t. I mean, it\u2019s a much wider distribution over there. So we'll talk a little bit more about that at our Analyst Day meeting.\nJason Gammel: Okay. Thanks.\nJeff Shellebarger: Yes\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please? Ryan, you might have your phone on mute. Ryan, we are still not hearing you.\nPat Yarrington: Maybe we\u2019ll try to queue him up again. Let\u2019s move on to the next caller, Jonathan.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please?\nPaul Sankey: Hi, Pat. Can you hear me?\nPat Yarrington: I can hear you. Thanks Paul.\nPaul Sankey: Very good. Good morning. Pat, you guided at the Analyst meeting to flat CapEx going forward. Today you seem to be saying that you may cut it. I'm not quite sure what the message is. I guess if we were to stay at current prices, we would anticipate lower CapEx in the future and you seem to be saying that would be -- well, I'm not even sure in what areas you would lower CapEx. Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: Yes. So what I was tying to say is and we are just in the middle of doing our business plans at the very moment and you know our process. We go through that at this time of year. We get approval of the Board and then we come out with our capital expenditure outlook for the year and we expect to do that. That typically would happen in December. So we are right in the midst of pulling all the plans together. And obviously, we are having to have some tough discussions around what do we think the price outlook is going to be? What do we think the cost structure is going to be? How much of our capital program is really in this non-discretionary, must get through the phases since these projects are already under construction versus how much is discretionary?. And so I tried in the prepared remarks to kind of walk you through that logic. Now in the discretionary category, there are areas like exploration. Exploration would be one of the first areas that you would look to perhaps trim back in the cash flow constrained sort of mode. There are other areas that we would look to, projects that are not under construction but are in the first few phases of development. I mean, these will be projects where a deferral really doesn\u2019t result in an economic loss or value destruction. So those are the first couple of areas that we would necessarily look. I\u2019d call to your attention that there have been some projects where we have already done a pushback on the FID for various reasons. So, for example, Rosebank was one of the areas that we deferred on the final investment decision. We sent -- we basically took a loot at that again and said, let\u2019s reassess the design construct, let\u2019s reassess the economics here, and frankly, that\u2019s turning out quite well from a design concept standpoint, as well as a reserve standpoint and that effort looks to be coming forward, perhaps sometime in 2015. We have also had -- you are probably aware with, we have also had a delay in the Indonesian deepwater project, because we weren\u2019t able to get government approvals in the timeframe that allowed the bids that we had received and the marketing efforts that have done to be -- to remain effective. So we are going to have to go through that cycle again. So there have been some projects that have moved out of the current year period for their own sort of operating reasons.\nPaul Sankey: Great. And then the follow-up would be, would we assume that your volume target for 2017 is regardless and viable or would you see the potential for that to need to be cut as a result of low prices? Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: Yeah. So, we take, Paul, the other thing I tried to mention is that, we take a long-term view on prices, because we think overtime, that\u2019s the direction, the world is still going to need our product and cost are going to rise to get access to more challenged resources. We still are on plan for the 3.1 million barrel a day production by 2017. We have a vast majority of that volume is already under construction and we can see our way to those barrels. You will recall, perhaps, that when we did put out that target back in March, we also indicated that there was about a 50,000 barrel a day cushion that we put in for the unknown and the unknowable, and so that is an opportunity there. Should some of these things move in or out of the portfolio? So some things are going to move out, some things are moving in. Jeff already talked about the strength in the Permian that we've got. So, all-in, our best view of the world right now is that 3.1 million barrel a day target is a good target for us.\nPaul Sankey: Thank you, Pat.\nPat Yarrington: The other think I would say maybe is that, we do, when we are putting our plans together and when we are actually taking our projects to investment, we obviously, test our investments against a mid-price scenario, but a low price scenario as well as the high-priced scenario. And I would just say that the low price scenario that we use, current prices are within that band.\nPaul Sankey: Great. And just if I could, the credit rating is all important isn't it, that is an important way to think about how much you would borrow?\nPat Yarrington: Yes. It is, credit rating is important, but we are a long way from compromising our AA status and we want to keep the AA status for exactly times like this when prices fall and we are committed on projects.\nPaul Sankey: Thanks. I\u2019ll let you move on. Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from J.P. Morgan. Your question please.\nPhil Gresh: Hi, Pat. Good morning.\nPat Yarrington: Good morning.\nPhil Gresh: Just a follow-up on Paul's question, you talked about some of the areas of flexibility. I appreciate the color there. Specifically for 2015 you talked about the major capital projects, you talked about the Permian still being attractive, et cetera? So, I guess, I was just wondering ballpark, is there a rough amount or a range you could give us in terms of your CapEx flexibility for next year, is it 10%? Just any preliminary thoughts you could give us?\nPat Yarrington: Phil, I don\u2019t really want to go down that pathway, because we are -- again, we are putting our budgets together right now. I mean, the areas that we would look to flex, exploration, it\u2019s currently been three that would probably come off some. These Phases 1 through 3 project developments that will take some declines. If -- again, if we see this price level holding. Base business and Permian activity those are obviously very economic plays at this particular point, but you could toggle those and you can toggle those without destroying value. It would mean delaying value but you wouldn\u2019t be destroying value. So those are all of the kinds of decision that we\u2019re working through at the very moment and I don't want to get ahead of our formal plan.\nPhil Gresh: Understood. I appreciate the additional color. My follow-up would be if we think about the levers available between the CapEx, incremental asset sales, buyback, I mean -- I guess, is it fair to say with your leverage where it is that maybe something on the CapEx and something on the asset sales would be more of a priority at this point or rank order relative to trimming the buybacks?\nPat Yarrington: Yeah. Again, I don\u2019t want to get ahead on that. I think all of those avenues are open to us and it\u2019s really going to be a question of how we settle out on our longer term -- medium-to-longer term view on prices and costs. And it\u2019s also going to be a function of the economic queue that we\u2019ve got. So we will take all those parameters in place. I\u2019ll just reemphasize that we have a fair amount of leverage, a lot of leverage still available to us. So that would be taken into account as well.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your questions, please.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Good morning guys. Jeff, I have -- if I could two questions, one on Duvernay, can you share with us the rationale behind the farm down? Is it because you think within your portfolio that this is not ranking as well or that it is a financial consideration? You just need the money so that you can accelerate the growth or that the development pace there. And secondly, that can you talk about from the Atlas acquisition that you also get the Utica acreage there. And relative to the Chevron portfolio, how do you rank those nine positions, does it even have any meaningful outlook on that future within your portfolio on those? Thank you.\nJeff Shellebarger: Hey too good questions Paul. On the Duvernay in Canada, we are very excited about that. It\u2019s very attractive. It\u2019s less mature than the Permian but the rocks that we\u2019ve seen out there and the performance that we\u2019ve seen on exploration program are good. Chevron has been very clear about our position on risk management. We had 100% interest in more than 300,000 acres out there. Typically we look to form that down a bit. It helps us manage risk. It helps us manage across our whole portfolio. So the sell down in that particular venture was really a part of our normal risk management process. With respect to the Utica, Southwestern Pennsylvania, these are very attractive prospects. Recall four years ago, three years ago when we bought into this thing, it was primarily dry gas and that\u2019s what was driving the business. Obviously that part of our portfolio we have a lower holding cost and we pull back from that with respect to investments on the liquid rich gas side and on the deeper Utica plays. We\u2019re very excited about those. Again we\u2019re seeing the same efficiencies in the drilling and completions up there as we see everywhere else. It\u2019s completing for our capital and it\u2019s important in our portfolio.\nPaul Cheng: Just -- again, I just had a quick follow-up. Do you have any rig drilling in Utica?\nJeff Shellebarger: Yeah. We have got one right out there.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nEvan Calio: Yeah. Good morning everybody and welcome Jeff. I will leave CapEx alone, but a modest silver lining on the low oil price is a positive PSC effect. I mean can you provide any sequential impact in 3Q and maybe just talk through what the typical timing or lag effect may be there?\nJeff Gustavson: I can take that one Evan. This is Jeff Gustavson.\nEvan Calio: Hi Jeff.\nJeff Gustavson: So we didn\u2019t see the full -- we did see a net production increase in the quarter but remember prices dropped kind of late in the quarter. So I think you see more of that in the fourth quarter assuming prices stay at the levels that they are at now. We redo our PSC sensitivity each and every year as part of our planning process. And right now these price levels what we\u2019re showing is about 1,500 barrel a day impact for dollar change in Brent prices. So that\u2019s a sensitivity you should be using going forward. I would note that this quarter and we mentioned this is in the text, we did have a couple of, maybe one-off effects, profit oil split change -- contractor versus government in Kazakhstan, that\u2019s with Karachaganak. So that was a little more of a pronounced impact, plus there was some variable royalty effects with our TCO affiliate. But going forward, 1.5 thousand barrels a day per dollar change is the sensitivity you should be using.\nEvan Calio: Great. Appreciate that. Maybe a question for the other, Jeff. On the Permian, you mentioned in your comments that it ranks highly. So, I presume it would be more insulated from any potential CapEx reduction and so that's correct. And then you clearly have a very large position in both basins. I didn't know if you could quantify, how much you net acreage was prospective Wolfcamp, Bone Springs or even lower Spraberry in Midland, if you had you could share that with us?\nJeff Shellebarger: Yeah. Well, just to confirm really what Pat said, the Permian does rank at the high end of our investment portfolio and it should be good at the current price environment. It is good at the current price environment that we see. With respect to quantifying the acreage position, I think that\u2019s in the eye of the holder. We have a large acreage position. It\u2019s across all the different benches. Everyday, there is a new bench that looks productive out there. What I can tell you is that the areas that we are focusing on development activity are the sweet spot, as we and the industry define those things today and they are highly respected. They are highly sort out after. We started looking at the edges of that basin. Other people are out there, they're trying new technology. They are testing those benches. So, I think what we are trying to do is not get out ahead of our skies on that and follow a bit appraisal work and the delineation of these things that are going on. But we are going to stay in highly perspective areas as we pace our development programs.\nEvan Calio: Is that what drives your location estimates then or is that kind of all more all-encompassing?\nJeff Shellebarger: The total location estimate is what we see across the basin with sort of the current and some advancement of the technologies that exists. Certainly, three years ago, we wouldn\u2019t have seen this kind of potential. Three years from now, it could be even better.\nEvan Calio: Yeah. It\u2019s trending that way. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please?\nEd Westlake: Good morning. Can you hear me?\nPat Yarrington: Hi, Ed. Yeah.\nEd Westlake: Great. So I guess some of the discussion around CapEx apart from oil prices comes from the slide at the Analyst Day this year where obviously you demonstrated that cash flow was going to come on from the major projects from the work that Mike Wirth has been doing in the Downstream and then obviously the shale contribution. But CapEx was going to stay relatively high to drive growth I guess beyond and into 2020. And the shade I see is sort of it $37 billion to $40 billion which is I guess more similar to this year. So, I'm trying to get a sense of what projects you were including in that sort of 2017 timeframe. You have mentioned Kitimat, IDD, Tengiz. How much of a contribution was there in that year, if you can share that with us, so we can get a sense of where the adjusted CapEx might be?\nPat Yarrington: I\u2019m not sure that I completely understand the question here. You are looking at 2017\u2026\nEd Westlake: I'm looking at how much of Kitimat and IDD and Tengiz, you were resuming in that sort of 2017 outlook that you gave us so that we can -- if they do delay not at Tengiz but Kitimat and IDD perhaps how much you would save?\nPat Yarrington: Yeah. I think for all of those you would be talking about modest contributions in the 2017 time period. Yeah. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an impactful element in terms of hitting that target.\nEd Westlake: Right on the CapEx side.\nPat Yarrington: No, I was talking on the production side, I\u2019m sorry. So you are talking on the CapEx side. But we didn\u2019t give a 2017 target. We did show you that slide that had cash from operations growing and C&E being more contained relative to cash from operations. We still stand by that overall profile. It is our distinct content to widen out our free cash flow over time once we get into the cash generation phase of these critical projects. We\u2019ve been in this very unusual capital intensive phase with Gorgon and Wheatstone and these large projects right on the heels of under, we are coming off of that. LNG\u2019s spending this year is going to probably the peak LNG spending, $10 billion to $11 billion. It will trail off in 2015. It will trail off again in 2016. And we don\u2019t have that kind of sequential large projects queued up in the -- beyond that time period. So we\u2019ll come out with a revised target on future year C&E as best we can in March at the Analyst Day meeting.\nEd Westlake: Okay. And then one for Jeff. The 20% CAGR if I calculated that right in the Permian is obviously quite impressive for any independent or major, what are the constraints? I mean, the resource is clearly there. What are the constraints on perhaps even going faster, perhaps as you get out into the second half of the decade in the Permian?\nJeff Shellebarger: Okay. Well, I think the basin itself if you look back the last three years, it\u2019s certainly capable of demonstrating that growth potential. I think we are up 0.5 million, we are almost 3 million barrels a day as an industry in that basin. The constraints are what everybody talks about, it\u2019s just basic stuff like the labor force out there. That\u2019s been challenged. It\u2019s a boom time out there. Water is a area of concern for some people. We work hard on that in terms of moving from fresh water to brackish non-potable drinking water securing those supplies and the infrastructure around that. Sand has been an issue, but I think the service companies and others are starting to address that supply chain issue. I think the real uncertainty for me is just how high that activity could go and what would be the knock-on effects of that, but you got to look at, there is a lot of companies in there and the current price environment maybe some of that stabilizes out. I don\u2019t see the activity levels that we see being at risk from takeaway capacity or really the contractor\u2019s ability to deliver, and that\u2019s one thing that we take into consideration when we look at our pace of investment.\nEd Westlake: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Asit Sen from Cowen and Company. Your question please.\nAsit Sen: Thanks. Good morning. Two quick ones here. First, could you update us on Kitimat? The potential timing of FID looks like at least one competing project is getting delayed. And secondly, could you update us on any labor productivity items on the West Coast of Australia in light of recent union agreement on Curtis Island? In other words, are things getting better?\nJeff Shellebarger: I could give a quick update on Kitimat. I will let Pat talk about Australia. So Apache has announced their intent to fully exit the project. We are still committed to this project. We think that the low cost potentially prolific reserves up in the Liard and Horn River are going to make an attractive LNG project in time. We have been very clear that we will not take FID at this project until we have gas contract signed and we know that we have got a value adding economic project. With respect to FID, we haven\u2019t given a data on that and we continue to do the feed work on the plant, the plant site. We continue to work with the government of British Columbia. We are encouraged by the recent news that\u2019s come out of there with respect to how they want to treat LNG in taxes, but our primary focus up there is really the appraisal and the delineation work that we\u2019ve got going on in the Liard Basin.\nPat Yarrington: Okay. And with regard to the union contract issue in Australia, at this point in time we know that there has been a Downstream agreement reached in-principal with certain construction unions and that it still needs to be put to a vote to the -- by the union membership. So we have agreement at the leadership level, but we still need to vote at the union member level. Frankly there is more dialogue in the press about challenges, union-related challenges for us on this project than there have been reality on the ground. So the project continues to make a good progress here. And I guess one of the exciting things that I would just mention, we didn\u2019t put it in the formal remarks, but we have secured, I guess I will call it a float-tel, I am not sure what the right hoteling accommodation nomenclature is, but we\u2019ve got the capacity over the next several weeks to bring overtime about 1200 additional workers to the island to work on the MEI work, that\u2019s underway that needs to be done in the next year. So that\u2019s a good boost we think in productivity for that.\nAsit Sen: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid from BMO. Your question please.\nIain Reid: Hi, there. Pat, I wonder if you could give me an update on the Wheatstone budget. It\u2019s I think about 49% through now in terms of spend. Is it time now that we get a kind of a complete updates in terms of how much that project is going to cost?\nPat Yarrington: Right. I mean at this point. Yes, you\u2019re right. We\u2019re about 49% complete. It is a typical process for us to go through and do a mid project to update. I don\u2019t have a specific calendar date for that but it would be a reasonable thing that we would do anytime between 40% and 60% when the project is done. So I would say, that\u2019s coming but I don\u2019t have a specific date as to when that will be completed.\nIain Reid: Okay. And maybe as a follow-up on another big international asset, Angola LNG. Can you give us a kind of cost to repair and some schedule for re-startup of that project?\nPat Yarrington: Sure. I can talk a little bit about the schedule side of things but there is not a cost estimate that I am available -- that I have available to give to you. Let me just make sure, we are just a 36% partner in a consortium here. We are not a controlling entity to work through the partnership there. But in terms of the progress on the repair work, we continue to make good progress there. We do at this point anticipate an initial restart somewhere around the middle of 2015. And after initial performance testing as it is typical that plant will go down. For a couple of month period of time where we clean out and remove the strainer, clean out the filter et cetera, then it will be brought back online. And we anticipate restarting and working towards sustained production levels late in 2015.\nJeff Shellebarger: Did that answer your question?\nIain Reid: Yeah. No, it did. Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Okay. Thank you. All right. I\u2019ll guess, we\u2019ll take the next caller.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allen Good from Morningstar. Your question please.\nAllen Good: Good morning, everyone. A couple on the Permian. First of all, when you look around you benchmark yourself against maybe some of your smaller peers there on operating costs and other efficiency metrics. How do you see yourself backing up? And then secondly, on the new projections for growth, would it be -- does it imply a commensurate step-up in spending as well or have you been able to achieve some capital efficiency improvements from your initial projections that suggest that spending won't quite increase as much as the production is?\nJeff Shellebarger: Yeah. Good questions. We benchmark ourselves all the time. We benchmark ourselves with respect to cost efficiency, or finding the development cost et cetera, et cetera. A year and a half ago, we were probably down at the lower end of our competition, part of that was because we were new in the basin and part of that was because we were focused on the appraisal in some of the other work to really understand what's going on in the basin and these new areas. And we made a concentrated effort in that area over the last 14 to 16 months. We\u2019ve made significant improvement in our execution efficiency, our cost-efficiency. Today, I would say, we\u2019re probably in the mid-upper part of the second quartile. Our performance targets here to be the top of the heat there and we\u2019re making very, very good progress on getting there. With respect to how we\u2019re improving and what's going on there, I mean, it\u2019s really a host of thing. Certainly, we are seeing capital efficiency in what we\u2019re doing. So we\u2019ve been able to drill more wells with the same amount of money. We\u2019re seeing efficiencies in our completion. But I think, even more important to that moving to horizontal wells, moving to longer lateral length, moving to more stages, our acreage position allows us to do that and we\u2019re going to see more of an impact on that in our production forecast than probably anything else.\nAllen Good: Hey, great. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up. Was the Duvernay sell down, was that included in the original $10 billion estimate of asset sales and then is there any potential upside for that figure over the next couple years?\nPat Yarrington: Yes. So we wouldn\u2019t really talk to what included or excluded in our overall target. Obviously, it\u2019s a significant component there. And in terms of future, I think your second question was is there future effort in that regard? I think that\u2019s \u2026.\nAllen Good: I mean, do you think there is -- I'm sorry. Is there upside to that $10 billion figure? Now that you've gone through it a little bit and progressed through do you see upside from your initial estimate?\nPat Yarrington: So I think, that\u2019s going to be a function of what the market is going to allow. We have certain assets which we\u2019ve tried to describe that are either early in life or late in life. We know what those assets are and we\u2019ll as I said only go for the sales when we can get good value. So it will be a function of what the market will look forward at that point in time. But we\u2019re on track for the $10 billion. We can see our way to that almost at this point in time. Certainly this year 2014 or maybe there will be some slippage into first quarter 2015 of some of the transactions that I\u2019ve line of sight on. But I feel very good about what we fit at this point in time.\nAllen Good: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones on LNG. First in relation to Kitimat. With the tax announcement from the BC government earlier this month, is that still a hurdle or are you pretty satisfied with how that went?\nJeff Shellebarger: Well, that\u2019s just one element of our investment decision. I think that what we\u2019re satisfied with is that the British Colombia Government is very attentive to the realities of the industry. They\u2019ve listened to what we\u2019ve said. They listened to what the buyers have said. And I think they\u2019ve made some very good moves in terms of what reality is out there and what it takes to make these projects economic. I mean, there are -- we\u2019ve got to work a whole lot of other issues between now and FID. And I think they'll remain. Our view is that they will continue to remain flexible in those discussions.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay. And then you mentioned you want to sign offtakes for Kitimat before FID, but you also have some remaining capacity at Gorgon, which as I understand is still not covered by offtake. Are you prioritizing one versus the other if a particular customer is open to either option?\nPat Yarrington: Well, I think the fundamental driver there is that the volumes would be available under different time frame. I mean Gorgon production starts in a year from now and ramps up with three trains over the subsequent years. Kitimat was going to be in a much longer term horizon there. Just speaking to the Gorgon unallocated volumes or uncontracted volume at this point time, yes, we are sitting at about 65%. We did have notionally some of that volume earmarked for as a backstop behind IDD from a customer arrangement standpoint. Now that the Indonesian deepwater is no longer going forward on that same development time plan, we are available to take some of those volumes that we had earmarked there and market them. And that\u2019s exactly what we're doing now.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay. That\u2019s useful. I appreciate it.\nPat Yarrington: Okay. So I think that ends our queue at this particular point in time. So I'd like to thank everybody on the call for your interest in Chevron and your participation with questions. We wish you a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-08-01 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPat Yarrington: Hey good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President, and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide two. Turning to Slide three, the company\u2019s second quarter earnings were $5.7 billion or $2.98 per diluted share. On a year-to-day basis, earnings were $10.2 million or $5.34 per diluted share. Included in this quarter's earnings were gains on asset sales of approximately $750 million and foreign exchange losses of $232 million, which together equate to a positive $0.27 per share. Year-to-day earnings after netting gains, impairments and foreign exchange impacts was $10.1 million or $5.29 per share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was approximately 12%. This reflects both the strength of our underlying producing assets and the fact that we are in the midst of a heavy construction period for a few key capital projects. Our debt ratio at the end of June was approximately 13% similar to last quarter. Our financial priorities are unchanged and we continue to reward shareholders with competitive distribution. We repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares during the second quarter and in the third quarter we expect to repurchase the same amount. Finally, Chevron\u2019s five-year total shareholder return at the end of the quarter was 18.4%, which continued to lead the peer group and also was in line with the S&P500 over the same time period. Turning to Slide four cash generated from operations was $7.9 billion during the second quarter and $16.3 billion year-to-date. Cash, capital expenditures were $8.9 billion during the quarter and $17.5 billion year-to-date. At the quarter end, our cash balances exceeded $14 billion giving us a net debt position of $9 billion. Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2014 earnings were $300 million higher than second quarter 2013 results. Foreign exchange negative affected earnings by $232 million during the quarter representing a negative swing of over a $0.5 million between periods. As a reminder foreign exchange movements for us are largely book translation effect with minimal cash flow impact. Upstream earnings increased by $315 million. Gains on assets transaction of approximately $610 million in absolute terms and higher realization were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact and higher exploration, DD&A and operating expenses. Downstream results decreased by $45 million. Higher U.S. refining, marketing and chemical earnings were offset by lower international refined product margins along with adverse foreign exchange effects. Movement in the other segment reflects an absence of a 2013 second quarter impairment and lower corporate expenses largely offset by higher corporate tax charges. Turning to Slide six, I\u2019ll now compare results for the second quarter of 2014 with the first quarter of 2014. Second quarter earnings were approximately $1.2 million higher than first quarter results. Upstream earnings were up $957 million reflecting gains on asset transactions, higher lifting, modestly strong realization and favorable tax effects. Partially offsetting were higher exploration and operating expenses in addition to an unfavorable foreign exchange movement between quarters. Downstream results were essentially flat. The variants in the other bar largely reflects the absence of the impairment and related charges for our mining asset from the prior quarter, partially offset by higher corporate expenses. Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment.\nJeff Gustavson: Thanks Pat. Turning to Slide seven, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $142 million higher than first quarter's results. Higher production volumes at the Perdido and Caesar Tonga Fields in the Gulf of Mexico in the Midland and Delaware Basin and the Permian and in San Joaquin Valley increased earnings by $115 million.` Higher exploration expenses mainly associated with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, decreased earnings by $95 million. The second quarter included gains on several separate assets transactions worth approximately $180 million in total. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including lower natural gas realization and higher operating expenses. Turning to Slide eight, international upstream earnings were $815 million higher than last quarter's results. Higher realizations and higher liftings increased earnings by $280 million. Our under-lifted position in the first quarter was essentially neutralized. Gains on the sale of our interest in Chad and Cameroon increased earnings by $430 million. Lower impairments compared to the prior quarter resulted in an earnings increase of $140 million. An unfavorable movement in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $95 million. The second quarter had a loss of about $150 million compared to a loss of about $55 million in the first quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including favorable tax effects, offset by higher operating and exploration expenses. Slide 9 summarizes the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2014 and the first quarter 2014. Production decreased by 43,000 barrels per day between quarters. Shale and tight resources growth contributed 6,000 barrels per day driven primarily by production increases from the Midland and Delaware Basin in the Permian. We are also seeing continued growth from the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina. Major capital projects decreased volumes by 13,000 barrels per day due to the shutdown of the LNG plant in Angola partially offset by the ramp up at Papa-Terra in Brazil and Caesar Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico. Plan turnarounds in Kazakhstan, Australia and in Denmark among others reduced production by 57,000 barrels per day. Absence of first quarter external constrains largely weather related disruptions in Kazakhstan as well as lower demand in Thailand, increased volumes by 27,000 barrels per day. The base business in other bar reflects normal field declines. Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2014 and the second quarter 2013. Production was 37,000 barrels per day lower than the same period a year ago. Growing volumes from our Shale and tight resources primarily driven by the Permian in the U.S. and Vaca Muerta in Argentina increased production by 33,000 barrels per day. Major capital projects contributed 13,000 barrels per day driven by Usan in Nigeria and Papa-Terra in Brazil partially offset by the shutdown of the LNG plant in Angola. Higher turnaround activity mainly in Kazakhstan reduced production by 21,000 barrels per day. Lower production in titanium effects due to lower cost recovery, higher prices and higher royalties reduced production by 37,000 barrels per day. The base business and other bar principally reflects normal field declines. Turning to Slide 11, U.S. downstream results increased $95 million between quarters. Stronger margins increased earnings by $140 million driven by tighter product supply due in part to industry refinery maintenance combined with higher seasonal demand, higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $130 million. About half of this was due to higher cost related to shutdown and maintenance activities at the El Segundo Refinery during the quarter. The turnaround was completed at the end of June and refinery operations have returned to normal. The remainder reflects higher maintenance and repair expenses at our other refineries and incremental costs from the startup of the Pascagoula base oil plant. Gains on midstream asset sales improved earnings by $40 million between quarters. The other bar reflects a number of items including stronger chemicals results. Turning to Slide 12, international downstream earnings decreased $84 million between quarters. Increased volumes improved earnings by $75 million following the completion of turnarounds at our Thailand and South Africa Refineries last quarter. Lower refinery margins decreased earnings by $15 million reflecting higher crude cost that could not be fully recovered in the marketplace. Foreign exchange losses were approximately $55 million higher compared to prior quarter. The second quarter had a loss of about $85 million compared to a loss of about $30 million in the first quarter. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $30 million. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items including minor asset transactions and lower trading results. George will now provide an update on our upstream operations. George?\nGeorge Kirkland: Thank you, Jeff. First I would like to highlight the progress on our Gorgon project. This photo shows the LNG plant in the foreground with the jetty in the distance. We continue to make excellent progress in the module fabrication yards and on Barrow Island. Module delivers are continuing on schedule and we are achieving our key milestones. Gorgon remains on track for a startup next year and will be a key contributor to our production grown in 2015 and beyond. I\u2019ll share a bit more on Gorgon later. Consistent with prior quarters we have posted additional progress photos for both Gorgon and Wheatstone, which can be found on our Investor page at Chevron.com. Now let's take a look at our Upstream financial performance on Slide 14. Our 2014 year-to-date Upstream earnings margins was $20.32 per barrel. The suggested margin does not include gains from any of our recent asset sales in this quarter. Based on the results for our peer group through the first half of the year we lead all our competitors by an average of over $3.50 per barrel. Relative to the first half of 2013, our earnings margins have softened. Foreign exchange swings reduced our margin by a $1.42 per barrel. This combined with higher exploration expansions and DDNA have been the primary contributors to this decline. We are cognizant of the current microenvironment, increasing cost of goods and services coupled with relatively flat commodity prices and we remain focused on managing controllable cost. Looking forward, we are expecting strong contributions from our new MCPs as they come online. Now I\u2019ll discuss our 2014 production results and outlook on Slide 15. Production in the first half of the year averaged 2.57 million barrels a day at an average year-to-date Brent price of just under $109 per barrel. The first half results are 43,000 barrels per day or 1.7% below our guidance. Relative to our guidance, production entitlement effects reduced production by approximately 20,000 barrels a day and the unplanned outage at Angola LNG reduced production by a further 15,000 barrels per day. Our base business performed well. Over the six months of the year, we have maintained a base decline rate of less than 3%. We also continue to see strong growth from shale and tight assets. During the second half of 2014, we anticipate further production ramp up at Papa-Terra in Brazil and our two Gulf of Mexico developments Tubular Bells and Jack/St. Malo as these are all scheduled to come online. During the second half of the year, we will perform the second of two planned turnarounds at TCO as well as execute large turnarounds in Thailand and in the North Sea. The product entitlement effects are anticipated to continue and we don\u2019t expect any LNG production in the second half of the year. Completed asset sales in the first half will of course affect second half production. We forecast 2014 production will average 98% to 99% of our January guidance. Our 2017 growth to 3.1 million barrels per day remains on track as we bring on our new projects and progress our shale and tight resources. I would like to provide you with a little more detail on the production growth, which we anticipate will occur over the next several years. Turning to Slide 16, our peer-leading growth to 2017 is largely driven the startup of our major capital projects. For the last several years, we\u2019ve been in a period of high investment while our MCPs progress through the construction phase. As these projects now transition to operations, beginning with our deepwater projects Tubular Bells and Jack/St. Malo, we forecast significant volume and earnings growth. We remain focused on executing our industry-leading queue of projects with excellence. We have the right people and processes to deliver these projects and we are excited about the value creation. While many projects contribute to our growth, the majority of our new volume is generated by aid of our largest MCPs. Gorgon and Wheatstone in Australia; Mafumeira Sul and ALNG in Angola, Papa-Terra in Brazil and Jack/St. Malo, Tubular Bells and Bigfoot in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Now I will review progress on six of these projects. Moving to Slide 17. In early April, Angola LNG experienced a failure in the flare blow down piping system. At the time of our first quarter earnings call, the investigation was still underway. Following a thorough analysis, a number of design issues have been identified, which will require modifications. In addition to the piping repairs, the LNG team will utilize this shutdown to perform capacity and reliability enhancements to the plant. Following completion of repairs and testing, the plant will restart and it is expected to achieve sustained production in the second half of 2015. The Gorgon project is now more than 83% complete. All Train 1 and common modules required for LNG operations have been delivered to Barrow Island and installed on foundations. Other down string work of Barrow continues to progress well with the jetty now 97% complete and the commissioning beginning this month on LNG Tank 1. Delivery of Train 2 modules has begun and 5 are now on site. On the Gorgon upstream, hydrotesting has been completed on all 660 km of offshore pipelines. The well flow back and clean up operations on the eight Gorgon wells is ongoing and drilling has been completed on the tenth and final Jansz-Io development well. The next major milestone is the completion of LNG tank 1, which is targeted for the end of this quarter. Wheatstone is now 40% complete. Dredging, build and piling work is progressing on schedule. The shore pool of the main 44-inch trunkline through the microtunnel was completed safely and as planned. Shipments from fabrication yards have commenced with the delivery of the first slug catcher components two side. The Wheatstone platform and topsides are now more than 63% complete and we anticipate the sailway of the platform\u2019s zero gravity structure in August. Wheatstone remains on track for a late 2016 startup. Now I will review progress on our deep water Gulf of Mexico projects. Moving to slide 18. The Tubular Bells project is nearing startup. All key tie-ins have been installed and tested and the wells are ready for production. Production operations are anticipated to come -- to commence in the third quarter. The remaining work on Jack/St. Malo is progressing well and the project remains on track for late fourth quarter startup. Overall hookup in commissioning and startup progress is now 73% complete. Tie-in spools for the Steel Catenary Risers have been installed and gas pipeline pre-commissioning is complete. Jack/St. Malo will be a key contributor to our production growth in 2015 as production ramps up. Bigfoot shipyard related construction is over 90% complete and preparations are being made for a fourth quarter sailway. Fabrication work on the tension leg platform tendons is now complete and whole and topside integration is nearing completion. The project team marked a major milestone with the heavy lifts of the drilling modules this quarter and as you can see in the picture on the slide. Bigfoot remains on track for a 2015 startup. We are pleased with the progress on our key deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. As these three projects ramp up during the next year, we will see a significant uptick in production as we move towards our 2017 goal. At peak capacity, these projects will deliver Chevron approximately 100,000 net barrels per day. Now I will provide an update on our shale and tight activities. Please turn to slide 19. Chevron is the largest producer in the Permian and has an enviable acreage position. We have the largest and developed leasehold and 90% of our acreage is either low or no royalty. We have over 17,000 well prospects identified and the potential to add eight to 10,000 more. Since we are not in a drill or drop situation our approach has been to allow others to derisk acreage surrounding our own. This enables us to focus our capital on development wells rather than exploration and appraisal. In the Midland basin of the Wolfcamp play, industry drilling today has been predominantly via vertical wells. Earlier this summer, we spotted our first horizontal Wolfcamp well. We now have 17 rigs operating in the Midland basin and 10 rigs operating in the Delaware basin where we added two rigs this quarter. We are on schedule to drill more than 500 wells this year in the Permian basin. Turning now to Argentina, Chevron is please with our initial results in the Vaca Muerta. Drilling results have helped us identify two sweet spots where we are focusing our activity. In one of these areas, we have commenced a horizontal program. We have seen a production uptick, which gives us confidence that we will deliver the growth we anticipated when we entered this play. Good progress is being made on our Duvernay program in Canada. Our wells have demonstrated good blow rates and high condensate yields and we are confident of the quality of our acreage. In the third quarter, we anticipate spotting the first of 16 wells as part of our expanded appraisal program. Also in Canada, we are continuing with the appraisal campaign in the Liard Basin. Results continue to indicate very favorable ultimate recoveries and high IPs, which will support our longer term plans for this asset. Moving to Slide 20. I will now highlight a few additional ongoing activities. We continue to have good success on our exploration program in the Carnarvon Basin in Australia. Since our announcement of Elphin 1 in April of last year we have made four additional discoveries. This provides us with additional gas resource and optimization alternatives for our Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG facilities. In March, we stayed at our target to deliver 10 billion in asset sales over the 2014 to 2016 time period and we are on our way to meeting that goal. Our recent divestiture of the Chad assets is one example of our focus on monetizing a mature declining business, which allows us to generate cash for potential reinvestment in other growth areas. We are also progressing the sale of several other mature assets including the Netherlands, our non-operated interest in Draugen in Norway, several leases in Nigeria as well as several smaller assets from our conventional North American portfolio. We recently achieved a major milestone at our Escravos gas-to-liquids plant with the production of GTL diesel in that. We anticipate continued ramp-up in first product lifting later this year. Our exploration and development program in the Utica is yielding good results for both liquids and gas. Industry results in the Utica shale have been encouraging from Ohio into West Virginia and Pennsylvania. We recently achieved a test of more than 32 million standard cubic feet per day on a 22/64\u2019s choke at one of our wells in the emerging southern trend. We anticipate this well will be turned into line this fall. And finally we\u2019re also very encouraged with the initial results in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Exploratory drilling and logging has indicated multiple play zones in a large structure. We have begun initial drillstone test and the formations have demonstrated the ability to deliver high liquid blow rates. On one of the two wells, we plan to test upto nine different zones. We\u2019ll continue with our KRI testing program over the months ahead. Now I will turn it back to Pat.\nPat Yarrington: Okay, thanks George. Turning to Slide 21. I would like to close with just a few thoughts. Global energy demand continues to grow and satisfying demand growth is a great business opportunity for us. We\u2019ve had the same basic strategies for a long time now. We believe they remain relevant and that they will continue drive future value growth for our shareholders. We continue to focus on executions. You just heard from George that our base business in the upstream continues to perform well and that we\u2019re making significant progress on our major capital projects. In the downstream we can also report success. The Pascagoula base oil plant or PBOP as we call it is now online. First commercial production began in June and the plant rampup to full production ended July. We are now the largest producer of premium base oil worldwide. Focus on execution also means operating safely and reliably. Through six months our personal and process safety performance has been strong across all the measures we typically share with you. The days away from work rate Tier-1 loss of containment and spills. Sustained value creation requires reinvestment in our business. This is necessary to meet future energy demand and is vital to sustaining growing rewards for our share holders. We have a broad, balanced and deep queue of investment opportunities and take a highly disciplined approach to capital allocations. We are actively managing our portfolio and are on track to meet our stated target of achieving proceeds from asset sales of $10 billion over the 2014 to 2016 time period. Through six months, asset sell proceeds at total $1.6 billion now are making good progress on a number of other planned transactions. We have the best growth profile amongst the peers between now and 2017. Every quarter as project milestones are checked off, we get one step closer to the inflexion point. Indeed, two of the projects George highlighted are set to startup in the second half of this year and two more in 2015. Along with this sizeable growth in volume, we expect will come significant growth in cash flows. We expect free cash flow to grow as well, thereby enabling higher shareholder distributions over time. I short we are very excited about what lies ahead for the company. So that concludes our prepared remarks. I certainly appreciate you listening in this morning. We are now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and one followup if necessary. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\nEd Westlake: Yes, good morning and thanks, George, for your time on the upstream as well. Maybe just firstly a question on cash flow. Last year about $36 billion, this year sort of $33 billion if you annualize the first half and obviously oil prices have state higher. It looks as if your turnarounds are in high margin areas, but is there any other deterioration in the cash flow relative to your expectations? Obviously you have given us some guidance on the Analyst Day of relatively strong cash flow growth from the 2013 basis as these major projects come on stream.\nPat Yarrington: Ed, we still feel good about our cash flow projections going out 2015, 2016 and 2017 and again it is obviously predicated on the production growth that George went through on major capital projects growth in the Permian and then also of course oil prices will be quite impactful there. If you\u2019re looking at the first half of this year, relative to the second half, I think one of the comments I would make would be downstream. Downstream has not been as cash prolific perhaps as certainly we would like. Many of the turnarounds that have -- we talked about on the slides are in the rear-view mirror so to speak at this point and so the second half of the year, we believe should be a better cash generation from a downstream standpoint.\nEd Westlake: Okay. Then a question on the upstream just generally. I'm looking at Slide 10 and of course you are slightly lower on production this year. But if you add up the turnaround production entitlements and base business you are losing some volumes, but even without major capital projects the volume trajectory is relatively flat. And then as I look at the slide that you put out, helpfully, on MCPs getting up to 900,000 barrels a day from the big projects and the other stuff that you are doing. And then I think about shale, it feels like something has to get worse to miss the 3.1 million barrel a day sort of 2017 guidance, which is a good position to be in. But I am just wondering what is it that gets worse in your assumptions as you look out?\nGeorge Kirkland: Ed I just don\u2019t have any things to get worse on our assumptions. If you remember when we came through at the SAM meeting and gave you our forecast of 3.1 we showed a 50,000 barrel a day buffer, so there is a buffer in there. The only and part of the reason we had that buffer in there was always the forecasting ability but recognize that we\u2019ve talked a lot more about asset sales and we have asset sales in our plan. We don\u2019t always know exactly what assets sales will actually occur. We are very focused always on the value proposition of those and that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve got to focus on, creating the greatest value on those asset sales and it is a reminder, when we look at asset sales, we\u2019re looking at two pieces. We\u2019re looking end of life assets, do they have continuing investment opportunities and then of course we look at some of our assets that are on the front that don\u2019t compete for funds. So we\u2019ve got a little bit of latitude in there to cover some of the assets sale losses that occur when we sell these properties but I can\u2019t give you the details on those because we are very value driven. We\u2019re going to make the best decision on getting the greatest value for anything we sell.\nEd Westlake: And very sneakily at the end, just in terms of three questions, it is not an entitlement change as you go forward. The pace of current entitlement changes stays flat through the forecast, do you think?\nGeorge Kirkland: Let me explain a little bit about the entitlement change in there and this probably heads off a question that we\u2019re likely to get from others. Each year when we give you our production forecast we have modeled and we have all kinds of assumptions on production entitlements. We do our very best job to try to nail those entitlements. We have a 20,000 barrel a day impact in our entitlements that are greater than what we had anticipated. We've shown that in that section, for me -- you have to understand. When we model this we\u2019ve all kinds of assumptions there. I\u2019ll just deal with two of those, the two biggest ones that make up most of this 20,000 barrels a day. The two of them are in TCO and in Bangladesh. The TCO one, we make assumptions of how much crude we\u2019re going to move via rail versus how much crude we\u2019re going to move on the CPC pipeline. We have that assumption. That comes up and tells us what we\u2019re going to -- gives us a really good indication of royalty net back that the well has. That gives us net back that the well heads, which impacts our royalty assumptions. This year we have moved more barrels on the CPC because it was available, actually about 80,000 barrels a day in TCO was moved more than was in the plan. That\u2019s great for us. That\u2019s great for Kazakhstan, great for the partnership because we get higher net backs. We\u2019ve also had higher prices on the sulphur and sulphur sold at a higher price translates to a higher net back for us that the well had also. And that reduces net production. It\u2019s a really good thing for all of us. So that\u2019s really positive. So if the value decision, right value decision. Similarly in Bangladesh, we\u2019ve had an agreement on how we would look at that. That is now going to be reimbursed and the reimbursement will not will in effect reduce our cost barrels. There is a impact on that. It\u2019s good for us to clear up the bad issue. It\u2019s good from a profit gas or profit oil basis going forward that removes that cost out of it. So that\u2019s another value creator for us not nearly as big as the TCO one but it\u2019s a positive for us and those two items made most of the difference on this entitlement. Good things, right way to run the business but we didn\u2019t have it modeled that way in our plan, so -- and I\u2019ll tell you we\u2019re always going to go after the piece that makes the most value sense. Maybe that will help.\nEd Westlake: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, good morning everyone.\nPat Yarrington: Good morning\nPaul Sankey: The first question I had is for George. Relating to the startups in the lower tertiary. George, you said in the past that the key to really good returns there would be increasing recoveries from I think you plan on 10% towards 20% recoveries. What is the path towards us -- and the timeframe I guess, towards us getting a better idea of how those recoveries will play out? Thanks.\nGeorge Kirkland: Paul thanks for the question. Historically what we had actually said is we looked at recoveries initially would be in the 8% to 10% range and then that we saw technologies, either completion technologies, reducing back pressure on the reservoir, items such as those technologies that would increase the recovery towards the 15 and then onto 20%. We do believe we are on track for that. I am going to feel a lot more confident as we get the first Jack/St. Malo wells on and we see our new completion technology, how successful we are there. We\u2019ll be watching production rates. I\u2019ll tell you I am encouraged that we\u2019ve done the cleanup on a number of those wells already. So when the facilities are ready, we\u2019ll be able to turn them on and we\u2019ll initially get a quick look of course at production rates. If our production rates are at the high end of our assumption, that\u2019s going to give us confidence that we\u2019re going to get a little bit more recovery. We should actually have some pretty good confidence in that on the little bit of impact on our recovery view and of course we\u2019ll have a much stronger view on production volumes as we get to the end of the year end March as we get a little bit of runtime on these wells. I feel good about what we\u2019ve seen on the cleanup though and I\u2019ll just leave it there qualitatively.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. Interesting. And then the follow-up I had was on Gorgon start up. When you say mid-2015 is that the first production of gas, the first production of LNG or the first sale of LNG? Thanks.\nGeorge Kirkland: It is the first production of LNG. It\u2019s not gas introduced into the plant. We\u2019ve a target to see gas introduced into the plant this year because we need the gas introduced into the plant to start commissioning activities. So one of our early activities is getting gas introduced in the plan getting the turbine generators running, get the power support for the operations. That utility piece is very critical to the startup and it\u2019s actually a milestone that we\u2019ll be talking about more in the next quarter\u2019s call.\nPaul Sankey: Cool and then the actual sale of LNG. When would that be?\nGeorge Kirkland: I am not going to go that next step. I am going to leave it till we have the first LNG in the tank, which we will announce and once we have first LNG we\u2019ll be announcing our target for first lifting.\nPaul Sankey: Interesting. Thanks. And you are still trying to sell more contracts there, aren't you? Is there any reason why we haven't heard more about that given you have shown modeling of a shortage of LNG long-term? I'm just surprised we haven't heard more about contracts. And I will leave it there. Thank you.\nGeorge Kirkland: Paul. We are still looking at opportunities so to sell more gas. We really don\u2019t have a lot more to sell. Remember on the Wheatstone side, we already stood at 85%. so we are fully sold out there. As a reminder, we have some ability to move gas in our contracts from different assets we own. So we have some flexibility there. We are still once again looking to increase that, but we are value driven so we need to get a price that we think is appropriate. The spot market has been good on a seasonal basis the last year so we feel pretty good about the volumes if we had to move them into the spot side. Preferentially we would move them to a longer term sales contract if we get the right kind of price.\nPat Yarrington: And Paul, I would just add that with the degree of uncertainty that there is about U.S. exports and the size of U.S. exports, I think there -- you can understand why buyers might want to wait a little bit to see how that all lands out before going forward to secure longer term contracts.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. Pat, I wonder if I could follow-up on Ed Westlake's question because this is something we have been kind of wrestling with. It may be overly simplistic, but you gave us cartoon at the Analyst Day that showed how the cash margin improves let's say in a $110 oil environment, so let's call that same-store sales with last year at $36 billion. But when we take the delta on production growth and the delta on the margin, it only adds about $8 billion to the cash flow, so that gets you to $44 billion, you are spending a little under $40 billion, the dividends are $7 billion and your buybacks are $5 billion. So can you help me with what else are you assuming in that inflection in cash flow that you talked about in your prepared remarks because your offstream guidance doesn't really seem to get us there.\nPat Yarrington: Are you talking about 2015 or 2017?\nDoug Leggate: In the cartoon it shows the post 2016 portfolio which I assume is, if we look at 2.1 million barrels a day in 2017 and the current portfolio at 2.7 million barrels a day last year would generate the $36 billion. So I'm trying to understand how big do you think the delta is, because according to your cartoon it is only about $8 billion.\nPat Yarrington: Let me just start. So we -- if you start from a 2013 base and you look out to 2015, let me just be clear on the assumptions that we have in there. So we\u2019re moving from the 2.7 million barrels a day last year to the 3.1 million barrels a day in 2017. The assumption on price in that slide was $110 a barrel Brent and when you get the increase in volume and you also get an accretion on the cash margin and that accretion is coming from significantly the major -- major capital projects that George has just run through, predominantly Gorgon and Wheatstone are huge contributors to that. That is really what gives you an underlying increase in upstream cash flows between what we saw at the base in 2013 and what we\u2019re expecting in 2017. On top of that, there will be we believe higher contributions in cash flows from our downstream sector. Obviously it's not as significant growth element there but there will be contributions on the chemical side and on the lubricant side and some of the R&M side. So when you put those components altogether we feel comfortable about saying under those set of assumptions particularly price and volume we\u2019re going get to $50 million cash generation figure. And I think the point that\u2019s really important here is the margin accretion that George has -- we've talked it for a couple of years here is not just on the incremental barrels, it's on the full portfolio and that\u2019s really what is the compelling point here, is that those projects coming online have the capacity to pull up the entire cash margin over the whole portfolio.\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate the answer. I will take it off-line with Jeff because, like I say, I am using your numbers and the delta looks like $8 billion, but I will talk to Jeff offline. My follow-up is really a Gorgon question, George, and thanks for getting on the call this morning. You talk about start up on Train 1, but can you talk to the ramp up to Train 3? Because obviously -- you are obviously familiar with the charter that has been out there constantly while this project has been moving forward, but start up is one thing but what about the ramp beyond that? Can you give us some comfort level on the pacing of Trains 2 and Trains 3 and I will leave it there?\nGeorge Kirkland: Historically what we\u2019ve said, we said we saw six months between train startups. So I\u2019ll try to give you a little more context to what\u2019s happening on train 2 and train 3 and I think very frankly it\u2019s very good news on the train 2. Modules we expect we\u2019ll have almost -- well, I'll just say most of the modules we\u2019re trying to own Barrow Island by the end of the year and we will even have a few we think of the train 3 modules. So the module piece of the work is going quite well, so it\u2019s moving forward very well. We don\u2019t see any of the module work at this point on the critical path. So all of that puts us in a strong position to say we\u2019re not seeing any slide on time between the startup of train 1 and train 2 and if anything, we may even see that tighten up a little bit but it\u2019s a little early to go there so but it looks good at this point and that\u2019s a real positive. Critical for us to get \u2013 get we'll try to get it offline.\nJeff Gustavson: And then we\u2019ll answer a lot of questions. Okay?\nDoug Leggate: Thanks very much indeed. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nEvan Calio: Hey, good afternoon guys. The position on free cash flow is clear. A question for George. Staying with LNG, one of your partners, Apache, yesterday announced plans to execute on that LNG and Wheatstone for that matter. Any update on that project and does Apache's exit change any as how you think about the risk profile of that potential project?\nGeorge Kirkland: Let me on -- we're -- we need to get our partnership resolved. That means Apache needs to move through the issues and we need to get a new partner in. That needs to happen. That\u2019s I think quite obvious. As long as we keep moving forward in the assessment of the resource in Liard I feel very good about the resource assessment. I think we already can check off our confidence level on the other resource, the Horn River resources is already high. We\u2019ve really done that appraisal so the focus on the resource side is really drilling in Liard, some appraisal work there and getting some production work. We think we\u2019ll have those actually those wells -- those first wells that we need to get some production data. We\u2019re going to be complete with them somewhere near the end of the year. So that\u2019s really important step for us. The other pieces that we\u2019re spending money on only aren\u2019t related to Liard. There\u2019s a little bit of money on how we\u2019re going to actually handle the upstream initial production and then of course we\u2019ve to focus on the pipeline and the pipeline quarter. That\u2019s important for us. We\u2019re putting some money into that to try to finalize a pipeline, rounding it all in clearances and then we\u2019ve got work at this point going on field work. Some field work on the plant itself. We have to understand cost and schedule on that plant. Those are the important things. We\u2019re not spending huge money but it is a lot of money in the sense I am sure for -- in the terms of 100s of millions of dollars. Now it\u2019s critical for us to have all of that where we can deal knowledgably with buyers. We have to understand cost. We have to understand resource where we can deal with the particulars of pricing, but we are not going to do a project unless it\u2019s economic. We\u2019ve always told you we\u2019re not going to go to FID one project till we have 16% of the gas sold. We\u2019ve to understand the project in a good sense to do that. So we\u2019ve got to understand project. We\u2019ve got to understand resource. I think we\u2019re moving quite well on answering the resource issue. I am not concerned with -- if Apache leaves that there I think we could easily step in and be operator of the upstream, quite confident there. Apache has been very good to work with in this early stages of the assessment at Liard. So I think we\u2019re in good shape but we need to get clarity, we need to cope, we need to get the closure on the partnership and this work. I\u2019ve mentioned we need to do all of that where we can deal with buyers and understand cost and understand economics. We are very value driven. We\u2019re not going to go to an FID and do a project until we have gas sales and we understand the economics of that sale.\nEvan Calio: Great, thanks. And my follow-up is if you could discuss Permian production in the quarter, and just how much did that contribute to the sequential 5% increase in U.S. volumes? And then as you think about 2015 and really bridging to the major project volumes in 2016 through 2018, do you see a scope and ability to further ramp Permian more significantly to bridge, like I said, the other major projects? Thanks.\nGeorge Kirkland: Let me start with the last part of that a little bit. Permian for us is an area we can increase investment and increase production. We will rather ramp at a appropriate speed where we are very cost efficient on drilling and on our infrastructure. So from that perspective, it is a little bit of an asset that we can gauge and move to speed. Specifically in the quarter I think we had a 5,000 barrel a day plus in from the Permian area that was good. We\u2019re right now running I said 27 rigs. We\u2019ve 14 verticals and 13 horizontals. So that\u2019s really good. I gave you the numbers on the slide of how many wells that have been drilled this year and I believe that was 265. We had told you in March this year that we were going to drill 500. You can see that we are ahead of schedule on that. I take it\u2019s related to some efficiency we\u2019ve seen in the rig operations. We\u2019ve got a grand focus on reducing cost. This business out there is frankly about two things. It\u2019s drilling cost, getting your drilling cost down and getting your recovery up. We\u2019ve got great focuses on both of those and like we\u2019re seeing the response. We\u2019re getting a few more wells and we\u2019re getting more barrels. We like what we\u2019ve seen. The more we continue to see that of course we are going to be more willing to push more money there.\nEvan Calio: Great. George. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.\nPaul Cheng: Hi guys. George, two questions if I could. On both Wheatstone and Kitimat, can you talk about from Chevron's position whether you have any interest to further increase your existing interest?\nGeorge Kirkland: Paul, I\u2019ll be happy to and maybe I\u2019ll for everyone on the phone I\u2019ll put in perspective a little bit. Wheatstone and our interest is relative but to others and I\u2019ll try to do that on Kitimat. At the Wheatstone asset level, so this is Wheatstone and Iago, the upstream piece of it, we hold 80% of that. Remember you have a partnership that\u2019s between Apache and KUFPEC that is Brunello Julimar online into a common facility offshore and that our investments in the Wheatstone project and the LNG portion of it is unitized if you will after that. The fields are not but we have a joint project from a central platform, a trunkline and into an LNG plant and at that point when you look at the LNG portion of it downstream, that portion of it -- we are investing 64%. We\u2019ve got all the interest we really want. It\u2019s a high end of our interest that we would normally have in any operation. I typically like to be when I operate in this 40% to 60% range. So our working interest is at the high end of that and we\u2019re quite comfortable. We don\u2019t see any reason to have any more working interest in Wheatstone or other assets there. Now speaking on Kitimat and I\u2019ll build off on some of those earlier comments. We hold 50% of the interest in Kitimat, Liard, Horn River assets. That\u2019s right in the middle of the sweet spot where we like to be on working interest where we\u2019re committing to run the projects and run operations. What we\u2019ve told the street in the past and I will reinforce this, we actually hold 50% of it and I don\u2019t want any more than the 50% and we do have available some small amount of working interest that we would provide to an LNG buyer and there\u2019s always been plan for us and Apache to have some volumes that we could -- some interest that could be sold down to buyers where they would be a part of the development and they would be in the full value chain. That has not changed and I am not looking to increase our working interest beyond the 50%.\nPaul Cheng: Second question, if I am looking at page 16 of the presentation, next year the major projects, the current expected increase is 150,000 barrels per day. Your base operation previously assumed is at 3% underlying decline curve, I assume that has not changed. That translated to roughly about an 80,000 barrels per day job year over year. So that means that based on this particular graph it would suggest this seems to imply your expected production growth for next year about 2% to 3%, get to about 2.65. I don't know whether you can give us a number what is your current projection for 2015 or if not can you tell us whether there is any other things that we should take into consideration in this calculation?\nGeorge Kirkland: Paul you are good with numbers. Okay, let me speak qualitative to this. First up, we give you our commitment number guidance in January each year. So in January 2015, we\u2019ll give you our guidance. I\u2019ll only give a few qualitative comments about -- you've done the numbers right relative to the MCPs. Our base decline is running in this 3% or less. That\u2019s true. We haven\u2019t yet given you guidance on two other items and I will tell you we\u2019re working that at this point in time. How many barrels are we going to have on our shale and tight? We have got investments going in shale and tight and the Permian. That\u2019s not in this number. How well is Vaca Muerta going to actually perform? So we\u2019ve got those two that are significant and we\u2019ve got to identify those as we got through our business plan process and of course we\u2019ve got another one that we haven\u2019t told anyone and we haven\u2019t ourselves haven\u2019t decided on which assets we\u2019re going to sell. So we\u2019ve got some sells that are going to occur. We are once again value drive. Actually I don\u2019t know which ones are the ones that we\u2019re going to end up and sell. What\u2019s the whole value open for us versus what will someone else pay on these late life assets. So those are the two aspects that I can\u2019t really answer at this point in time. But we will be able to give an answer in January.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jeffries and Company. Your question please.\nJason Gammel: Thanks, everyone. I wanted to come back to Gorgon if I could. George, if I was interpreting your comments correctly, it seems that critical path on Train 1 would be more delivering first gas on the island and commissioning work on the train itself and also the utilities. Can you confirm that is correct? And when you think about the risks towards meeting that mid-2015 objective, where would you put labor amongst those and what is your labor contract situation? I am just thinking in light of what is happening on Curtis Island right now?\nGeorge Kirkland: Let me start off on the critical path items going for us. ME&I is critical for startup. That is heavily dependent on labor productivity. We\u2019ve got over 5,000 people working on the island. It\u2019s all about for us getting as much of that effort focused on the ME&I piece of it/ And I guess I would add one other thing and we don\u2019t find any unknown problem. As we get closer and closer to startup and this is true for every project that everyone does in the world, it's these unknowns that you just frankly don\u2019t know what's going to come up and is it something that is easily mitigated or is it something not and we don\u2019t ever know that until we get them all done. The good news is that every day you get closer, you eliminate more and more of them and being an 83% we\u2019ve already eliminated a lot of them like logistic we know is not a critical path. We were worried about the jetty. It\u2019s not the critical path. So we\u2019re eliminating those every day. Some big milestones that we\u2019ll report out in the following quarters. An example of big one that we don\u2019t have the tank. We want to make sure we got LNG tank 1 ready. Often on LNG projects the tanks are the critical path. We\u2019re just about to the point to say LNG tank 1, with it being complete, it\u2019s not going to be in the critical path. I mentioned ME&I one of the big next ones for us is the startup of our turbine generators. We\u2019ve got all five of our generators there on the island, the next big step and a big important step for us milestone is of course power. We get the power running. That puts us in a great position on the commissioning and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll talk about on our next call, so we\u2019ll keep giving you this information as we click them off and I do encourage everyone since this being brought up again is -- take a look at some of those photos that we have. They are -- I think they really give you a flavor of what work is being completed.\nJason Gammel: And George, where do you set in terms of labor contracts -- or excuse me, where do some of the contractors set in terms of their labor contracts? And do you have any changes to cost estimate? I think I know the answer to that one. And would you expect to do a Wheatstone cost evaluation at the 50% completion mark like what you did with Gorgon?\nGeorge Kirkland: That\u2019s a yes. We always do that on all our projects Jason. Labor is very important. We never take that for granted. We always have a strong focus on the industry relations piece. We do have some contracts that have to be renegotiated and of course we\u2019re going to focus on making sure we deal with them where they don\u2019t become an issue.\nJason Gammel: Thanks a lot George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John herland from Societe Generale. Your question please.\nJohn Herland: Thank you. I have got a couple of quick ones for you, George. With Jack/St. Malo, are you going to ramp those wells up the way you would a Miocene well since they are different? Just curious.\nGeorge Kirkland: I would actually think that we\u2019re going to probably see a little bit slower ramp up on those. Remember these are very high pressure wells. The last thing we want to do is do any damage to the completion. So we\u2019re going to be very focused and I would say probably a little bit on the cautious side on the ramp of these and make sure we really understand what\u2019s happening at the place of the completion.\nJohn Herland: Great, thanks. Then with the Permian, you are talking about drilling a lot of wells. Any issues with basin evacuation in terms of fluids or gas -- in terms of infrastructure.\nGeorge Kirkland: I think it is becoming a little more challenging for the industry in total. We feel very good about where we are and our position. That\u2019s one of the huge benefits for being a company that\u2019s been a large producer there for the long history of the basin. So we\u2019re in a good position on that. I would tell you the other real positive, the industry in Texas moves darn quick in solving infrastructure problems.\nJohn Herland: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks, everybody. If I could follow-up on an earlier question in terms of the pace of the onshore. If we look at your performance, I think over the past 12 months these biggest bar on the growth side was from your tight and shale assets. You have got extremely high quality positions in the Permian and Argentina and a number of other places. And given the volatility of performance in some international offshore assets on timing and the smoother profile and the returns on the onshore side, is there a case to be made, not just over the next 12 months, but over the next five years to reallocate more capital in that direction and away from some of the other projects?\nGeorge Kirkland: We had to look at it on a portfolio basis and that\u2019s what we do each and every year as we build a new three year business plan and actually a longer strategic plan. We have a portfolio that has lots of options out there. You can move things in and out quite easily but it takes a portfolio that\u2019s got these options available. We do that each and every year. We don\u2019t like to jerk any of our business around. We would like to keep our rig counts if they are growing. We would like to keep them growing in a gradual manner not a big spurt. We\u2019re more efficient when we do that and of course we have to balance all that with our capital programs. We don\u2019t have an infinite amount of capital spend. So we try to get our capital focused on how we can get the best returns. So we\u2019re going to I guess high grade our view going forward of how we want to spend our money in our business plan each year. We told you at our Analyst Meeting that in the next three years, we\u2019re going to be really capital flat, pretty capital flat. That means we\u2019re going to be looking at how we get the most value out of that capital we spend. My anticipation is that we\u2019ll continue to see a little more money continuing to grow, go the Permian Basin but the Permian Basin or these other shale plays cannot offset the impact of these big projects either. We need all of that in our portfolio to grow. We must have all the big projects and frankly what the continuous plays give us. They give us another piece that\u2019s more continuous in growth and a nice part to have in your portfolio and we\u2019re going to grow that a little bit over time. So it\u2019s going to give us a little more flexibility as we go forward.\nRyan Todd: Okay.\nPat Yarrington: Okay I think we\u2019ve got time for just one more question here.\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks. I\u2019ve two quick ones. You\u2019ve highlighted the production uplift from the Vaca Muerta but given the headlines from Argentina this week are you reconsidering or just doing any investment?\nGeorge Kirkland: We believe our contract and the terms we have and have them negotiated provide us appropriate cover and I am just going to leave it there. We feel good about our investments. The way it\u2019s set up. We\u2019re frankly pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making there. We\u2019re making good progress. The next big thing for me is actually continuing to watch the performance of the asset and I am particularly interested in these two new sweet spots where we\u2019re drilling more wells and what I want to see there is I want to see a production kick-up and then I\u2019ll feel better but I feel contractually with what we\u2019ve established.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay, that is helpful. And on Kitimat, given the pending Apache exit, are you still likely to be able to reach FID by the end of this year or are we looking at 2015 at this point?\nGeorge Kirkland: We will reach FID when we -- and we\u2019re running our business there to be able to get to FID shortly after having 60% to 70% of our gas committed to an SPA, a sales and purchase agreement. That is the critical decision maker on both timing and the investment decision.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay. So irrespective of what happens with Apache?\nGeorge Kirkland: Irrespective of what happens with Apache. We\u2019re driven by once again having a sales contracts or sale contracts that give us 60% to 70% of the gas committed and for an economic price.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay. Thanks very much.\nPat Yarrington: Okay thank you. Before we close the call, I would like to mention that going forward we will no longer be issuing an interim update. For those of you who have followed us for some time, you will know that we have modified the format of our update over the past few years in an effort to have it be a clear and effective document. I have to say that that effort has not met with 100% success. Rather many investors have suggested that it has not been all that helpful or insightful and at times has added confusion rather than clarity. That\u2019s not a good place to be and hence our decision to stop the practice. We do remain committed though to full disclosure and transparency and as we have in the past, we\u2019ll strive to be very candid and clear in describing company performance in our earnings releases and our earnings call and our 10-Ks and our 10-Qs and in all of our other investor outreach activities. I would like to thank everybody for your time today. We truly appreciate your interest in Chevron. Jonathan, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-05-02 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPat Yarrington: Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Jeff Gustavson, General Manager for Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company\u2019s first quarter earnings were $4.5 billion or $2.36 per diluted share. Results are consistent with our earlier guidance, where we highlighted specific negative impacts associated with foreign exchange and selected asset impairments and related charges, which totaled approximately $500 million for the quarter or $0.26 per share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 12%. Our debt ratio at the end of March was approximately 13%. Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $8.4 billion during the first quarter. Cash capital expenditures were $8.5 billion. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled $16.2 billon, giving us a net debt position of $6.9 billion. On Slide 5, this week Chevron\u2019s Board of Directors declared a $1.07 per share quarterly common dividend payable in mid-June. This represents an 8% annualized payout increase. Since 2004, we have grown the dividend by a compound annual rate in excess of 10%, which leads the competitor groups. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the second quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount. We are committed to competitive, consistent and growing shareholder distributions. This demonstrates the importance we placed on balancing long-term investor return objectives, achieved through reinvestment in the business, with near-term return objectives achieved through distributions. It also reflects the strength of our balance sheet, our strong portfolio and our confidence in the cash generation potential of our growth projects. Turning to the next slide. We\u2019ve incorporated two new slides into the presentation this quarter, which provide year-over-year comparisons consistent with our earnings press release. The first, shown on Slide 6, compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2014 earnings were $4.5 billion, approximately $1.7 billion lower than first quarter 2013 results. Adverse foreign exchange movements accounted for $325 million or 20% of the overall decline. You\u2019ll recall that foreign exchange movements for us are largely book translation effects with very little cash flow impact. Upstream earnings were down $1.6 billion. In addition to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of about $225 million, the deterioration reflected lower crude oil production and liquids realizations and higher tax effects, DD&A and exploration expenses. Downstream results were essentially flat. And the other segment reflected the impairment of a mining asset, which resulted in an approximately $265 million absolute impact during the quarter, and was offset to a large degree by lower corporate expenses. Turning to Slide 7. I\u2019ll now compare results for the first quarter of 2014 with the fourth quarter of 2013. First quarter earnings were $418 million lower than fourth quarter results. Upstream earnings were down $545 million, with adverse foreign exchange movements accounting for two-thirds of this decline. The timing of listings was the second significant contributor to upstream quarter-on-quarter deterioration. Downstream results increased by $320 million with nearly equal improvements noted in the U.S. and the international segments. The current quarter had favorable impacts from lower operating expenses, stronger chemical results and positive foreign exchange movements, all of which more than offset the adverse volume effects of a heavier turnaround schedule. The variance in the other bar largely reflects the impairment of a mining asset, partially offset by lower corporate expenses. Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment. Jeff?\nJeff Gustavson: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. upstream earnings for the first quarter were $109 million higher than fourth quarter\u2019s results. Higher realizations increased earnings by $130 million, mainly due to the rise in U.S. natural gas prices. Overall, liquids realizations also rose in large part reflecting crude pricing strength on the West Coast. Lower production volumes, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico reduced earnings by $50 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including the absence of year-end LIFO losses and lower exploration expenses, partially offset by higher DD&A. Turning to Slide 9. International upstream earnings were $654 million lower than last quarter\u2019s results. Realizations decreased earnings by $50 million consistent with the decline in Brent prices between quarters. The timing of liftings across multiple countries decreased earnings by $235 million. Year-to-date, we are approximately 4% undirected, which as you know, should reverse in the coming quarters. Lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $190 million, mainly driven by fewer exploration well write-offs and overall lower geological and geophysical expenses across multiple locations. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $355 million. The first quarter had a loss of about $55 million, compared to a gain of $300 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The tax in other bar reflects unfavorable tax effects, many of which were non-income related. This quarter\u2019s results includes several non-operational items mainly impairments which negatively impacted upstream segment earnings by about $150 million. Adjusting for these effects, our unit earnings for the quarter would have been approximately $20 per barrel. The reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP earnings can be found in the appendix of this slide presentation. The upstream segment was also negatively impacted by FX effects in the timing of liftings, both of which are normally transitory in nature. Slide 10 summarizes the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter 2014 and the fourth quarter 2013. Production increased by 12,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects contributed 21,000 barrels per day, related to higher volumes at Angola LNG and the ramp-up associated with the Papa-Terra field offshore, Brazil. Shale and tight resources growth contributed 12,000 barrels per day driven by production increases from the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, as well as continued production ramp up from the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina. The base business in other bar includes the impact of normal field declines and weather-related disruptions, primarily due to extremely low temperatures in Kazakhstan, partially offset by lower production downtime related to several assets. Slide 11 is the second to two new slides incorporated into the presentation this quarter, and compares the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of last year. Production was 57,000 barrels per day lower than the same period a year ago. Growing volumes from our shale and tight resources in the Permian and the Marcellus regions in the U.S. and the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina increased first quarter production by 37,000 barrels per day. Major capital projects contributed 23,000 barrels per day, driven primarily by production growth from Angola LNG and Papa-Terra in Brazil. Production was impacted by external constraints related to the very cold temperatures in Kazakhstan, as well as lower demand in Thailand, due to a lighting strike which damaged a customer\u2019s gas processing plant in the third quarter of 2013. The base business in other bar includes normal field declines along with other unrelated impacts. Our base decline rate averaged less than 3% between quarters. Turning to Slide 12. U.S. downstream results increased $157 million between quarters. Planned turnarounds at our Richmond, California and Pascagoula, Mississippi refineries lowered volumes and decreased earnings by $85 million compared to last quarter. More than offsetting these volume effects were benefits from lower OpEx worth $95 million and stronger chemicals results worth $80 million. Stronger U.S. chemicals results reflected higher margins for benzene, olefins and polyolefins from our Chevron Phillips Chemical joint-venture. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, primarily higher gains on midstream asset sales, partially offset by modestly lower realized margins, particularly on the West Coast, reflecting weak seasonal demand. Moving to Slide 13. International downstream earnings increased $163 million between quarters. Reduced volumes from turnarounds at our Thailand and South Africa refineries decreased earnings by $75 million during the quarter. Stronger Asia R&M margins improved earnings by $70 million. Increased demands drove refining crack spreads higher particularly for low gas and fuel oil. In addition, favorable price lag effects improved marketing margins. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $85 million, about half of which is related to fuel costs. Reduced foreign exchanges losses contributed about $70 million to earnings. The first quarter had a loss of $28 million, compared to a loss of $96 million in the fourth quarter. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items, including higher chemicals results partially offset by the absence of positive year-end LIFO inventory effects recorded in the fourth quarter. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn it back to Pat.\nPat Yarrington: Okay, Jeff. Thanks. Turning to Slide 14. We hosted our security analyst meeting in early March, where we provided a comprehensive update on the company\u2019s performance, projects and future growth prospects. At that time, full information was not available for some of the competitor comparisons. It is available now and the segment return on capital employed updates are shown here. Our upstream return on capital employed for 2013 was just over 17%. We have led the direct peer group for three years. In addition, our returns in 2013 were nearly twice the average returns of the larger E&P group and 3% higher than the very best company in that group. This speaks to the strength of our portfolio and is especially impressive considering our current levels of reinvestment, which we expect will generate peer-leading volume growth going forward. Our downstream return on capital employed turned to lower in 2013, consistent with the rest of the industry. We delivered a 10% return and held the number two rank in the peer group, our sustained position for the last four years. Turning to Slide 15. An updated information on 2013 upstream cash margins. During 2013, with the $38 per barrel cash margins, we were the best in the peer group by over $10 per barrel. We continue to post the highest realizations in the peer group. Our oil weighted portfolio is providing us with a lasting relative advantage. We\u2019re also competitive on operating costs and have made sound investment decisions, both of which support our strong cash margin positions. Over the past four years, the movement in our cash margin relative to the competition has been remarkable, as shown on the chart on the left. While we\u2019ve gained $15 per barrel in cash margin, our peers have gained only $8 on average. Importantly, we expect to maintain or even increase our cash margins going forward. At our analyst meeting, we used a Brent price of $110 per barrel as the basis for our forward cash flow and production projections. We have received a number of questions around the selection of the $110 per barrel price, and I want to be clear that this is not an internal price forecast, but is simply the actual average Brent price over the 2011 to 2013 time period. Using prior year\u2019s actual pricing is the same methodology we have applied for several years now in our analyst presentations. At this historical three-year average Brent price of $110 per barrel, our cash margin is expected to increase to over $40 per barrel later this decade. This is a critical part of our value proposition, as the combination of strong volume growth and an accretive cash margin is expected to drive significant growth in our cash flow from operations over the next several years. Turning to Slide 16. I\u2019d like to provide a brief progress update on some of our major capital projects and other growth opportunities. These are laid out across three growth themes: deepwater, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico; LNG, in particular, our two large Australian projects; and shale and tight resource areas, most notably the Permian Basin in the U.S. and the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina. Starting with the deepwater. As noted last month, the Jack/St. Malo platform was moored in a title location earlier this year. We continued installation and commissioning activities including final testing of flowlines and export lines. The project is on-budget and is on-track for late startup in the fourth quarter of this year. For Tubular Bells, which is operated by Hess, hook-up and commissioning is nearly 40% complete and startup is expected before year-end. We also made significant progress at Big Foot during March. The oil export pipeline has been installed and we are preparing to let the drilling module to the top sides later this month. We expect startup to occur mid-2015. Moving onto our LNG project. We continue to make excellent progress at Gorgon, which is now, through April, 80% complete. The final two gas turbine generators have been installed and additional progress has been made on the LNG tanks, jetty and other related infrastructure on the island. All major 2014 milestones are on track and we expect plant startup and first gas in mid-2015. For Wheatstone, we are now at 33% complete. Progress continues to be made at the plant site on the Wheatstone platform and with the offshore development drilling campaign. Wheatstone remains on track to startup in late 2016. Gorgon and Wheatstone are critical contributors to our future growth plans and we are pleased with the study progress being made on both of these projects. As in prior quarters, we have posted updated photos of both projects on our investor website. I encourage you to take a look. We also continued to make progress on our shale and tight resource developments, which nicely complement our large major capital projects. We have an active drilling and development program in the Permian Basin and we have drilled over 120 wells so far this year. We continue to focus on capital and execution efficiency, as well as the identification of sweet spots throughout our extensive acreage position in both the Midland and Delaware sub basins. We are also making steady progress in the Vaca Muerta Share in Argentina, progressing this year\u2019s development program, and we recently signed additional agreements for incremental explorations acreage in the play. On Slide 17, I also like to touch on additional progress made elsewhere. We reached final investment decision and received approval from the U.K. government to proceed with the development of the Alder Field in the Central North Sea. We achieved first projections in the Chirag Oil Project in Azerbaijan and acquired new exploration acreage in Myanmar. In the downstream, we achieved mechanical completions of our new base oil facility at our Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery. Once fully ramped up, this increases our capacity and premium base oil by over 70%, making Chevron the largest premium base oil producer in the world. In addition, Chevron Phillips Chemical 1-Hexene project as well as Oronite Singapore Expansion project recently achieved mechanical completions. Lastly, CPChem started construction on its new Gulf Coast Petrochemicals project, which capitalizes on advanced feedstock source from shale gas in North America. This project is expected to startup in 2017. Now, that concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. We\u2019re now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and to one follow-up if necessary. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, I\u2019d ask that you open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nEvan Calio: Hi, good morning.\nPat Yarrington: Hi Evan.\nEvan Calio: Pat, thanks for the comments on the impairment, as it clearly affects a clean comparison of your quarterly upstream profitability. I missed it. I know you\u2019ve identified $400 million to $500 million of upstream impairments in your reconciliation. I see $150 million. And I thought I heard you mention $265 million. Can you just talk me through those numbers once again please?\nPat Yarrington: Sure. The interim update we\u2019ve talked about a total of $400 million to $500 million in additional negative charges. And that included foreign exchange and impairments, but we did reference strongly in that total the mining component. That mining component is $265 million.\nEvan Calio: Okay.\nPat Yarrington: And then in the appendix slide that you\u2019ll see, there is also $150 million worth of upstream-related impairments in the international segment.\nEvan Calio: I see, I got you on the total. Thanks. And I guess my second question, just your net debt increased. It was at $3.2 billion in the quarter, smaller capital increase. I mean I know you intent to bridge to 2015 and beyond when productive capital begins to drop and cash flow from new projects commences. Where do you see the debt limit? Is it at AA level, at the mid 20s, and then what type of commodity price cushion do you forecast in crossing that bridge and maintaining current shareholder distributions? Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: Okay. Evan, I think you referenced several questions there and we had a couple of really important words in there. One you talked about bridging. That is an important concept for us. Our free cash flow was essentially neutral in this particular quarter. And you\u2019re right, so net debt did increase and that reference that\u2019s related to distribution to shareholders. We\u2019re very comfortable with that pattern. It\u2019s a pattern that we\u2019ve had for the last few quarters. It\u2019s the pattern that we could see continuing on here in 2014, and then when we get into 2015 and you begin to see these volumes pick-up and the cash flows pick-up, then we get into a different state. We do want to maintain the AA credit rating. We have a lot of room between where our debt level is today at 13% and what would be necessary to even call that into jeopardy. And by a lot, I mean several billion dollars worth of additional borrowing capacity. We do test our own plan against a low priced environment. And I can tell you that against the low price environment, even continuing on with the capital program that we have, we are very comfortable with the distributions that we\u2019re making, even in a low priced environment and maintaining the AA.\nEvan Calio: Can you just share what that low price means?\nPat Yarrington: No, we don\u2019t want to go that far. Don\u2019t want to go that far. So we do look at the overall capital position and financial position of the firm. We test it against the oil prices and we feel comfortable and look where we are. The other thing I would mention is that we do have \u2013 you\u2019ll recall from the March presentation, we are anticipating assets of proceeds of $10 billion over the next three years.\nEvan Calio: Right. I appreciate. Thanks for taking my questions\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\nEd Westlake: Yes, good morning, and thanks for the extra disclosures in the presentation. Just a question on cash flow, I mean I think capital you said that $8 billion. It\u2019s been running higher than that and volume is flattish in the macro environment and you\u2019ve shouted out under-lifts and some extra tax but where there any other things that may have contributed to a slightly lower cash flow this quarter?\nPat Yarrington: Nothing of any substantial nature. It was not \u2013 I mean with the under-lifting circumstance, it is not a particularly strong U.S. downstream quarter. So I think there are some operational factors that really lead to the $8 billion cap generation, $8.4 billion.\nEd Westlake: Good. Thanks very much. And then Gorgon, you\u2019ve said 80% complete. You\u2019ve obviously just had the Analyst Day and said mid-2015, other people \u2013 perhaps even partners are saying perhaps more later in the year, sort of 2016. I don\u2019t want to get into a debate that, he said, she said, but what\u2019s the critical path that you think in terms of getting Gorgon up mid-2015? What are the risks that you\u2019re now worried about as you get further into the final stages here?\nPat Yarrington: I think we have 20 of the 21 critical process modules for Train 1 and the infrastructure, the common facilities infrastructure on the island. The remaining train is due shortly, will arrive shortly. So it really becomes a process of the hook-up and commissioning. And I think that is \u2013 we\u2019ve just come through kind of weather period. So we\u2019re moving into good weather. And so I think weather continues to be a risk. And I think labor productivity continues to be a risk, but both of those, I mean those are aspects of this project that we have been managing now for 4.5, five years. And so those are clearly on everybody\u2019s minds at in terms of managing through this. And I want to reiterate that the project is on track. We\u2019re aiming for and targeting that mid-2015 startup.\nEd Westlake: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, good morning, Jeff and Pat. If I could, kind of a big one and the small one. The big one is, you have an interesting number, Pat, which is on productive capital. Could you update us on that number and talk a little bit about how you calculate the number so that we can perhaps use it to compare with other companies? And the follow-up is on Vaca Muerta and I\u2019ll ask you that due course. Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: Okay. Well, basically we just look at \u2013 it really is just assets under construction, I mean definitionally. It\u2019s assets in our work in progress account as a percentage of our total capital employed. And the information that we provided back in March suggested that we\u2019re at pretty high level, predominantly because of the LNG projects that we have underway, as well as the couple of Gulf of Mexico deepwater projects. And we indicated that we saw that stepping down significantly over the next three year period of time. And I also said verbally that we saw pretty important stair steps going from 2013 to 2014 and again to \u201815 and \u201816. We didn\u2019t give actual numbers, I don\u2019t really want to do that, but that pattern that was on our slide back in March is still one that we hold to. So as you see these projects come online, they move out of that WIP account, that work-in-progress account into a producing asset account.\nPaul Sankey: My other question was that there was an actual numbers on productive capital. And I guess if you could update us on capital employed or at least the last available number?\nPat Yarrington: Well, year-end capital employed was about $171 billion. And what we \u2013 right, so the information we gave in the slide was a three-year average there.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. And what was the unproductive number?\nJeff Gustavson: So Paul, the three-year average \u201811 to \u201813 was in the low 40% range.\nPat Yarrington: Right.\nJeff Gustavson: Moving down to the mid 30s range for \u201814 to \u201816, but that\u2019s the average \u201814 through \u201816, steps down each of those \u2013 in each of those years our historic average here maybe the high 20s.\nPaul Sankey: Yes, that\u2019s right. So it was percentages around corner [ph].\nPat Yarrington: It was percentages. And we use the averages and you should \u2013 I think it\u2019s fair to say that 2011 was the lowest of the three years. 2012 was the middle of the three years and 2013 was the highest of the three years, but the three-year average there was at low 40s. And then what we\u2019re saying is \u201814, \u201815 and \u201816 will reverse that pattern.\nPaul Sankey: Yes, understood. Okay. That\u2019s helpful on that calculation. And then if I can, can you do a little bit more to strip out Argentina. You\u2019ve kind of bundled it with Permian.\nPat Yarrington: Okay.\nPaul Sankey: And you plan to wish that still acquisition growth as opposed to organic growth? Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Yes. Well, so I think that in terms of the Vaca Muerta play itself, we\u2019re continuing to make progress there. Our plan is to drill about 140 wells. This year we\u2019ve got about 17, 18 or 19 rigs drilling at this particular point in time in production there. On a growth basis is about 17,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re encouraged by the well we\u2019ve built, both on cost and productivity, but there is still \u2013 its early days. There is still a long way to go but we\u2019re encouraged so far.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. I think I\u2019ll take it offline on rig count in terms of volumes year-over-year. You\u2019re just obviously saying that on the variance you\u2019d bundled Vaca with Permian.\nPat Yarrington: I see. I misunderstood the question.\nPaul Sankey: No, thanks for the answer. Absolutely, that was just the follow-up really.\nJeff Gustavson: So year-over-year, Paul, we haven\u2019t booked production in the first quarter of last year. We started booking production in the fourth quarter. So there is a contribution fourth quarter to first quarter but over quarters. I mean it is acquisition related, but if you want to talk more specifically about it just talk me offline.\nPaul Sankey: Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, Jeff and Pat. I\u2019ve got also the one big and one small one, if that\u2019s okay. On the impairments part, is that the reason for the high DD&A number, and if so, can you give us an idea of what the run rate should be?\nPat Yarrington: It certainly is a contributor to the high DD&A rate. Absolutely that\u2019s a factor. And in terms of general DD&A, I think that it\u2019s fair to say that overall quarter DD&A is going to go forward, move up. Our expectation would be they would move up in 2014 relative to 2013. And we think opportunities in acre bell [ph] rising for the next couple of years, but then flattening out overtime. The patterns on both the absolute and the per barrel is something that you would absolutely expect because of recent investments and our future investments that obviously is also impacted by reserve ad timing and the mix of our projects etcetera. PPC or pre-productive capital as we talked about is going to come down. So I think the thing you\u2019ve got to keep in mind here too is that for these investments, there is evidencing itself and will evidence itself in our DD&A rate. We are giving the investments audience to the largest growth rate of the peer group. A 20% growth rate in volumes between now and 2017. So a significant investment, so generating significant volume growth.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. But I\u2019ll take the specifics on DD&A offline with Jeff if that\u2019s okay. My follow-up is really your last point, because I think the growth and the cash margins really actually fairly well understood. What simply we\u2019ve observed over the years is that not really gets paid by the market when it\u2019s accompanied by strong debt adjusted tools if you like, so the balance sheet is not expanding at the same time. So I\u2019m just kind of curious, when you look at your \u2013 you say you\u2019re absorbing the best 20% growth, how do you think about the trade-off that\u2019s $10 billion annual run rate on the balance sheet? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: So I mean I guess I think that if you\u2019ve got the project queue, a slowing project queue and you\u2019ve got a balance sheet that allows you to invest for that. And we do have a balance sheet. In fact you could really argue that for years we were under-levered relative to what might be optimal. So if you\u2019ve got this strong project queue and if you\u2019ve got the balance sheet to support it and the projects are value-accreting for the organization, for the firm, then I think that\u2019s exactly the kind of investment profile you ought to be undertaking.\nDoug Leggate: All right. I appreciate your answers. Thanks Pat.\nPat Yarrington: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.\nPaul Cheng: Hi guys. Good morning.\nPat Yarrington: Hi Paul.\nPaul Cheng: I don\u2019t know whether you want to answer that. I think a lot of people are asking that for CPC your joint-venture, strategically is there any particular reason you need to owning that so that you can have synergy with your other operations, if not, if you look it as a financial investment, does it makes sense for you to only minority interest and put it up as a publicly traded entity together with your partner Phillips 66 and putting into the market so that you can recognize a much higher value given right now that you\u2019re trading at higher multiple than say both your partner and yourself?\nPat Yarrington: Yes, so I understand the question there. And I\u2019ll just start back with, when we put the two companies together, we had too I guess I would say sort of the meddling performing chemical companies, if we put them together. And it\u2019s been a wonderful marriage. The partners are very much aligned on how to run this business, where you extract value from this business. And so it\u2019s a joint-venture that has worked very well and has been very successful, so we\u2019re very pleased. So, there no catalysts that\u2019s out there necessarily to say that we need to be doing something different. It is the part of the portfolio that has growth opportunities available to it. And we appreciate that, with this change in the U.S. gas production and advantaged feedstock opportunities here. I think CPChem calls on the technical expertise of both of its parent company and we\u2019re able to and happy to assist them in that capacity. We think it fits nicely in our portfolio. It has \u2013 the chemical business is highly, highly cyclical, more so than our portfolio. And so we\u2019re able to withstand the adjustments that are there, we think that\u2019s an advantage as well. So we are really seeing that there is huge catalyst for us to do something different. And it\u2019s not always clear that the PE multiples in these petrochemical commodity companies are always trading at multiples better than ours. So we like the joint-venture. We think it\u2019s well run. We\u2019re happy to assist and its growth projects and providing expertise and technical capability where we can. We\u2019re very satisfied with it, and I dare to say that our joint-venture partner will be feeling much the same.\nPaul Cheng: Okay, very good. Second question, can you give us a quick update where the Angola LNG going out, I just wondering you had 50% capacity. And also in the Permian with the 25 rigs, do you have a number that how many of them is currently running in the conventional and whether [indiscernible] already? Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Okay, let me start with Angola and then you might to help me again on the second question. So on Angola, we did have recently a technical issue pop-up. We had a piping failure, which did result in an unplanned interruption to production. There was no fire. There were no injuries. It was a pretty localized damage. It was associated with the flare system. We are doing a root cause investigation and in fact that root cause analysis should be completed within a few days here is my understanding. So the plant is currently shutdown and we\u2019ll need to take a look at that root cause analysis to understand what the go-forward operating plan looks like. That failure occurred sort of mid-April, early April, and it therefore was not an impact in the first quarter results.\nPaul Cheng: Permian, the 25 rigs. How many of them is in unconventional drilling and of which how many of them is in the pad drilling already?\nPat Yarrington: Okay. So all of the 25 rigs in the Permian right now are in the unconventional. We have only one rig drilling in the conventional. And I think you\u2019re asking about pad drilling?\nPaul Cheng: Yes, correct.\nPat Yarrington: I don\u2019t have information on that specific at this point, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid from Bank of Montreal. Your question please.\nIain Reid: Yes. Hi guys. Thanks very much. Sorry about this, but can I get back to the impairments and asset divestments you put in the reconciliation back. Because I didn\u2019t understanding some of the stuff you talked about earlier. You got $150 million of E&P impairments. It looks like in the first quarter, and also $100 million gain on dispositions. I think you also got this mining write-down as well. If you just put those together for me again?\nPat Yarrington: Sure. So let\u2019s start with the biggest element, which is the mining element. We have a molybdenum mine in New Mexico. And the impairment charges that we talked about there and other related charges that I talked to at the very beginning, the $265 million relates to that. That asset from a segmented reporting basis is in our other segment. In upstream, we noted a $150 million of impairments. It\u2019s in the international sector for us. So these are assets where we feel there is better opportunity in other portfolios basically. And then the third element that was noted there was a asset sale gain. This was in our \u201cmidstream sector\u201d. It\u2019s really pipeline-related and that showed up in the downstream external segment.\nIain Reid: Okay. Thanks very much. And secondly was, is it possible to update us on when we\u2019re likely to see the Tengiz hit [ph] to FID?\nPat Yarrington: Our targets for this year \u2013 our target is to have that towards the end of the year. I don\u2019t really have any additional information at this point. We were successful in getting the MoU signed back in the later part of last year, which really is a stage setting document to get all the partners aligned on the go-forward process. And so, we\u2019re in the process now of going through and working the cost estimates etcetera, etcetera. So all I can say is towards the end of this year.\nIain Reid: And we should expect a kind of overall CapEx \u2013 growth CapEx for this project, and along the line just some of your major things you\u2019re doing in Australia. Is that correct, or is that kind of ballpark, right sort of number?\nPat Yarrington: Well, I\u2019m sorry. So I\u2019m sorry, TCO is Kazakhstan, right. I guess one last thing there on TCO. The FID is not kind of critical path. What was the question on Atyrau, I didn\u2019t quite understand?\nIain Reid: Sorry, I just want to get an overall ballpark on Atyrau, what the overall cost estimate of the future growth project is going to be? Is it in the same ballpark as what you\u2019re doing in Australia?\nPat Yarrington: I see, Iain. We don\u2019t have an updated \u2013 we don\u2019t have a cost estimate until we go to FID. So that will be later and attached to the FID timings.\nIain Reid: All right. Thanks Pat.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your question please.\nFaisel Khan: Thanks, good morning. First question on Jack/St. Malo. You said that it was moored on location. I just want to understand a little bit, how much sort of wiggle room do you guys have from now to the startup to get that project going, and if there is an active hurricane season, have you built in that sort of weather into the startup and end of the year for that project?\nPat Yarrington: Well, it\u2019s my understanding that when we\u2019re putting these facilities out in the Gulf of Mexico, we do as much weather proofing as we possibly can. Obviously, when you\u2019re investing at the size of these facilities, that\u2019s an important consideration. So clearly having it moored is an important step. And so our expectation is that we would be able to handle any weather complications that might arise.\nFaisel Khan: Okay, fair enough.\nJeff Gustavson: Can I just to add, Faisel too.\nFaisel Khan: Yes.\nJeff Gustavson: If there are hurricanes, you have to demobilize. If the folks that are working on it, that could slow things down a little bit, but we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s hard to estimate what\u2019s going to happen there.\nFaisel Khan: I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand if you guys have sort of incorporated that into your guidance of the startup?\nPat Yarrington: In a general sense from a planning standpoint, we always do factor in Gulf of Mexico weather activities to a degree, right. But each year is a difference degree, you know what I mean.\nFaisel Khan: Sure.\nPat Yarrington: So there is obviously a base load that we include in our plans, yes.\nFaisel Khan: Okay. That\u2019s fair. I understand. And then just on the under-lift, you guys talked about the sequential quarter-over-quarter charge of $235 million. Is that also fair to say that that\u2019s the absolute number too?\nJeff Gustavson: So I\u2019ll give you the absolute for the quarter is about $100 million, about half of that. So the rest of that is swing between the two quarters, Faisel.\nFaisel Khan: Okay, got you. Thanks. I appreciate the detail.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking my questions. You\u2019re obviously talking a lot more proactively about the Permian, presumably you\u2019d like to get more value for that asset. Have you considered any kind of financial engineering solution that might unlock that value, more so than simply as one piece of your U.S. portfolio?\nPat Yarrington: Well, we think we actually try for sitting in, kind of in the catbird seat in terms of the acreage position that we\u2019ve got, the long standing acreage position we\u2019ve got, the royalty advantage that we have there. We have done joint-ventures, of a kind of \u2013 with for example, Cimarex, where we have partnered with similarly situated partners. And those kinds of things you could see us continuing to do on a go-forward basis. If you get commonality of infrastructure and location and you can get efficiencies of drilling where that you\u2019re fracking can really go from our property to their property. So we will continue to look for those opportunities for synergies. We\u2019ve got a very active program scheduled for this year. It\u2019s over 500 wells. And 25 rigs, we\u2019ve done 120 drilling so far. So the activity level is at or perhaps little bit better than planned at this point. So we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities like that, but we\u2019re proceeding had on our own as well.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay. And just quickly, can I get an update on the exploration program in Liberia? I haven\u2019t heard about that in a while.\nPat Yarrington: Yes, we\u2019re not in a position to say anything more at this point.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay. Fair enough, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber from Simmons & Company. Your question please.\nGuy Baber: Thank you all for taking my question. My first one was on the 2014 production guidance, but understanding it\u2019s still very early in the year, just wanted to get a sense of how confident you guys are in the guidance right now, just considering some of the weather influence that you\u2019ve got in 1Q, the unplanned downtime at Angola LNG, and in 2Q and 3Q typically being heavier maintenance course. Just wanted to better understand how you guys are feeling about that internally and any cushion you might built-in into the guidance?\nPat Yarrington: Okay. That\u2019s a good question. I guess I would just start by saying the year is young. We\u2019ve only had four months or three months in here. There have been some positive. Jeff mentioned a figure about base business declines being at the 3% or little bit less than 3% level. So that\u2019s a very good positive. One thing we haven\u2019t mentioned of a positive nature is at Frade, we now have 10 producing wells on and we continue to make progress to bring on additional wells there. We talked about the Permian ramp ups and the Vaca Muerta ramp ups that are occurring. So those are all working in our favor. Clearly weather has been a negative for us in the first quarter. On an absolute basis, we would estimate that that was worth 20,000 barrels a day or so absolutely negative in the quarter. I mentioned the A-LNG operational issues that we have there. So you put those altogether, you got some pluses, you got some minuses. And the back-end of the year, we\u2019ve got Tubular Bells and Jack/St. Malo, both of which are scheduled to come online, so our production ramp ups are kind of back-end loaded. And both of those projects are on track. So the best I can say is, and I\u2019ll go back and say, we built-in weather contingencies in our Gulf of Mexico plan in particular, for a base load amount. I\u2019ll just go back and say the year is young. We\u2019ve got positive and negatives out there. We feel that the guidance that we gave, the $26.10 is the best guidance that we have at this particular point in time. And as we do every year on the second quarter, we\u2019ll update you with how things look at that point in time.\nGuy Baber: Okay, great. Thanks for that. That was very helpful. And then my follow-up was on, one of your three primary growth themes of deepwater. And I\u2019m more focused on your next generation of projects looking beyond the near-term startups that you have lined up, if we start thinking about look at your reserve additions and then longer term growth potential, but you all have a number of potential FID this year, which you have an interest in, I think Stampede and then you\u2019re Indonesia development at Bangka, and then you\u2019re also reevaluating Rosebank. So understanding that every project is unique, how would provide some more commentary on just how conducive the overall environment right now is to pushing forward deepwater FIDs just in line of your view of the cost environment and the evolution of project economics and what you might see as opportunity for cost savings. Just given what\u2019s generally appears to be a more disciplined approach to screening these projects for you all and with some of your peers?\nPat Yarrington: Okay. Well, I think I would say if I step back and look at deepwater, I think for Chevron portfolio you mentioned a number of projects, but I think the most strategic basin continues to be the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. And we\u2019ve got number of wells drilling now and we\u2019ll have additional wells drilling over the next 12 to 18 months, a significant number of them, six wells in the next 12 to eight months. So that continues to be an area of strategic focus. And we think we\u2019re competitive there on facility structure as well as drilling costs, completion costs. So that\u2019s important area for us. If I look at IDD. IDD is a complex project. It\u2019s multiple fields. And right now we\u2019re in a position of waiting for government approvals. And then on Rosebank, we did really with the operator kind of put that \u2013 as the operator put that into a recycle mode, because the cost that had come through we\u2019re really didn\u2019t make it compete for capital within our portfolio. So that\u2019s somewhat in a recycle mode. So I think the overall impression that you have about the industry stepping back and taking a look at the cost run up for some of these resource place relative to the value capture, I think some of that is being reassessed as you indicate, Rosebank is a good example of that.\nGuy Baber: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes, good morning.\nPat Yarrington: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: I guess to come back to the Permian a little bit, if I understood correctly, you were not or have not to this point drilled any horizontal wells in the Midland Basin. Was that accurate?\nPat Yarrington: We are looking to spud the first one later on this year.\nRoger Read: Okay. So thinking about how production from the horizontal wells is typically been a little more, let\u2019s say higher IP rates so that. We should think about the shale and tight production accelerating, I don\u2019t know, call a Q4 certainly into \u201815. Would that be consistent with how you\u2019re looking at things?\nPat Yarrington: So I think it would be fair to say that if you go forward and you look at quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter improvement, we would be looking to see improvements kind of quarter-after-quarter. Our real focus has been on getting capital efficiency, maximize and getting a strong execution of business being well. So it\u2019s really been on optimizing the value creation. And so we\u2019ve been spending time to understand where the best areas are. And what the most efficient rigs had and overall development plan is. Frankly, a lot of the other producers there have been allowing us to de-risk did play by the work that they have done and that\u2019s in a sense advantageous to us. And we think we can get overtime the same kind of synergies and efficiencies that the smaller operators have. And one of the slides that we have put out in the security analyst meeting gave a good indication of what we see as year-on-year net production increases in the Permian Basin. And at the pretty significant growth rate, we also talk to essentially doubling of our rig count over the next several years from where it is currently.\nRoger Read: All right. Well, I guess we now have a couple of quarters here where you\u2019re breaking out shale and tight from everything else, so start to get a feel for what the quarter-over-quarter year-over-year performance is.\nPat Yarrington: Exactly.\nRoger Read: So just want to make sure I was understanding the way it should progress here.\nPat Yarrington: Right. And we\u2019re hopeful for quarter-on-quarter improvement going forward.\nRoger Read: Good. I guess my follow-up question, the Angola LNG obviously going to be offline in terms of volume contribution in the second quarter for some significant period of time, but if you think about \u2013 and I know, sometimes you don\u2019t get too granular, but the impact on it from a cash flow standpoint. I mean was this operation given the troubles it\u2019s had so far actually contributing much or should we think about it as mostly a production impact but not a problem for cash flows as we look in the next couple of quarters?\nPat Yarrington: Yes, I think you will see \u2013 it will be more noticeable clearly in the production side than the cash flow side clearly. And I don\u2019t have \u2013 as I mentioned, we need to have the root cause analysis done before we have an indication of when \u2013 what that repair and maintenance \u2013 repair activity will look like, and how long that will take and then when we might get back to a producing mode.\nRoger Read: Okay. I\u2019ll leave it with that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Pat Yarrington for any further remarks.\nPat Yarrington: All right. Thank you, Jonathan. I guess we got through everybody\u2019s question. So I appreciate your time and interest today. I especially want to thank all the analysts on behalf of all the participants for the questions that they asked in this morning\u2019s session. So Jonathan, I\u2019ll turn it back to you and thank everybody. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. And thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude Chevron\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect. Good day."}], "2016": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2015, "date": "2016-01-29 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Frank Mount, the General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two. Turning to slide three, today we announced a quarterly loss and annual results that were significantly below prior years. Pat will walk you through the financial details, but prior to that, I would like to provide a few thoughts. In 2015 we delivered strong underlying operating results. We had one of our best years in personal safety, process safety and environmental performance. On most measures, we either matched 2014's record low or set new lows in 2015. The downstream business produced strong financial performance underpinned by one of the best years ever in terms of facility utilization and reliability. In upstream, we grew production by 2%, within the guidance we provided a year ago. Additionally, we logged a five-year reserve replacement ratio of 113%. Despite the strong operating results, an oversupplied market led to prices fall to levels not seen since 2014. As expected, our financial results suffered. Across the corporation, we are responding to this low-price environment. Our priorities remain completing projects under construction and reducing spend, both operating expense and capital, to levels consistent with current conditions. We will also continue to divest assets where we can obtain a good value. Our number one financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend. We have a strong balance sheet for precisely transition times like this. Pat will now take you through our financial results.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, thanks John. I will be presenting three slides on our financial results. Additional earnings and production variance slides along with a tabulation of special items are available in the appendix section of the presentation on our website. Turning now to slide four, an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter loss was $588 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange, impairments and other special items, earnings for the quarter totaled $491 million or $0.26 per share. For the year, earnings were $4.6 billion, or $5.6 billion excluding special items and foreign exchange. Return on capital employed was 2.5% and our debt ratio at year end was approximately 20%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends, bringing our total for the year to $8 billion or $4.28 per share. 2015 was the 28th consecutive year of annual per share dividend increases. Turning to slide five, cash generated from operations was $4.6 billion during the fourth quarter and $19.5 billion for the full year. Fourth quarter cash flow declined because of lower commodity prices and lower downstream margins. Proceeds from asset sales for 2015 were $5.7 billion, bringing our two year total to more than $11 billion. Cash capital expenditures were $7.4 billion for the quarter and $29.5 billion for the full year. At year end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled more than $11 billion. During 2015, we borrowed approximately $11 billion and at year end our net debt stood at $27 billion resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 15%. Slide six compares 2015 full year earnings with 2014. Earnings for 2015 were $4.6 billion or approximately $14.7 billion lower than the 2014 results. Special items such as asset impairments, project suspensions and other charges, along with lower gains on asset sales, reduced earnings between periods by $3.1 billion while the change in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by approximately $300 million. Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased $14.6 billion between periods, as lower realizations were only slightly offset by higher liftings, lower operating costs and other items. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $2.2 billion, primarily due to higher margins. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects lower tax items. I'd like to now turn it back to John.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide seven, we are aggressively reducing investment and driving cost out of our business. During 2015, total spend was down approximately $9 billion or more than 12%. Capital outlays alone were down $6 billion. Part of this reduction was long scheduled as in-progress major capital projects were completed and outlays ramped down. In addition, capital expenditure savings were achieved because of deliberate choices being made to reprioritize and repace investments and by challenging supply chain costs. Operating expenses also declined between years. The largest impact occurred in our upstream and corporate segments, reflecting purposeful initiatives to rationalize head count and boost workflow efficiencies. In upstream, declining cost in growing production led to a lower operating cost per barrel, which is expected to exceed 10% when the final results are reported in our 10-K. Looking to 2016, we expect to see additional spend reduction in the range of 13% to 18% as the full year run rate effects of many of the 2015 initiatives come to bear and incremental cost saving projects are implemented. Turn to slide eight. Our investment priorities remain consistent. We will fund investments to ensure safe, reliable operations, complete the projects already under construction, enable investment in high-return short cycle opportunities and preserve options for viable long-cycle projects. In December we announced a 2016 capital program of $26.6 billion, which was within the guidance range provided on our third quarter earnings call. Since then, market conditions have deteriorated and we will be responsive. Flexibility in our capital program allows discretion in our spend with a likely outcome for 2016 being near the bottom of our guidance range. Looking beyond 2016, our flexibility will continue to increase and we expect further reductions in our capital program. Turning to slide nine. Divestitures are a normal part of our portfolio work. We will divest assets that no longer have a strategic fit or do not compete for capital with our other investment alternatives. Our asset sales program has been successful as well-timed transactions have captured good value and generated $11.5 billion in cash through the end of 2015. Over 2016 and 2017 we are targeting another $5 billion to $10 billion in investments. Publicly known in-progress transactions include New Zealand and South Africa downstream businesses, the Hawaii refinery, upstream and pipeline assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and gas storage assets in Canada. Additional opportunities are being pursued and will be disclosed in due course when commercial sensitivities permit. In all cases, we will only sell assets where we can realize fair value. Turning to slide 10. In 2015 we grew annual production by 2%. Ramp-ups at major capital projects including Jack/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Bibiyana expansion in Bangladesh, along with shale and tight production growth of approximately 30% contributed to increased volumes. Additionally, current prices benefited production through PSC and other entitlement effects. Offsetting the increases was the effect of a shut-in of the Partitioned Zone production, the impact of asset sales and a base decline of less than 2%. For 2016, our production guidance is a range of flat to 4% growth. The uncertainty is a reflection of market conditions, current activities and divestments. To clarify, production from the Partitioned Zone remains shut in. The exact timing of production restart is unknown and dependent on dispute resolutions between sovereign states. Contributions from major capitals project startups and ramp ups will be significant in 2016 and small movements in timing or the pace of ramp-ups can make a significant difference in annual production. Uncertainty in exact timing and precise composition of asset divestments will be another variable because we are value-driven on all sales. Finally, current market conditions will create impacts related to PSC and other pricing-related entitlement effects. Additionally, low prices will restrict our overall spend levels, which in turn will result in somewhat higher base decline rates. Turning to slide 11, our reserve replacement in 2015 was 107%. We saw significant adds in our shale and tight assets, which reflects strong well performance results and new geologic data in these plays. Additional volumes were booked based upon development drilling results at Wheatstone. Strong base business performance resulted in positive reserve revisions including Tengiz, Thailand, Nigeria and the Gulf of Mexico. Commodity price impact benefited entitlement volumes for profit sharing and variable royalty contracts. Our five-year reserve replacement ratio is 113%. Now let's talk about progress on our major capital projects starting with Gorgon. Turning to slide 12, at Gorgon system commissioning from train 1 is in the final stages with key process units starting up, a cooldown cargo delivered and system cooling under way. The first LNG production is expected within the next few weeks with first cargo anticipated soon after that. We'll be ramping up train 1 in the months ahead. Gas for a train 1 startup will come from Io-Jansz wells. These wells have been successfully flow tested, and initial performance indications look good. On trains 2 and 3, all modules have been delivered to site and construction is progressing. Lessons learned from train 1 are being applied and key milestones are being achieved on schedule, with startups expected at approximately six-month intervals after train 1. Turning to Wheatstone on slide 13. On the upstream portion of the project, hookup and commissioning of the offshore platform is progressing. The trunkline is ready for service, and final tie-in work is ongoing. Six of nine wells are drilled and completed offering sufficient well capacity for the first train. At the plant site, the operations center and LNG loading jetty are complete, and tank hydro testing is ongoing. As previously communicated, initial module fabrication in Malaysia was delayed. We were successful in mitigating further delays, and all modules required for train 1 are now on site. Piping and cabling work is ongoing. The pace of this work will determine critical path towards first LNG, which is expected to be mid-year 2017. Train 2 module deliveries are underway and on track. Turning to slide 15. I've just run through the steps we've already taken to improve our financial results and to be responsive to current market conditions. On the elements we control, operating expenses, capital outlays and project execution, you can expect even more improvements in 2016. However, price remains a significant uncertainty. I'll come back to that in just a minute. What I would like to talk about is other projects that we have that are also contributing to our performance. If you look at the chart on page 14, you'll see that we have significant progress on new projects. We have the Lianzi and Moho Nord, which came on in the fourth quarter. Chuandongbei, the first train on Chuandongbei, has come online. And here in January of 2016, we're seeing progress on Angola LNG as recommissioning is under way. We expect to introduce gas to the plant later this quarter and have first LNG cargo in the second quarter. Mafumeira Sul in Angola, Bangka in Indonesia, and Alder in the North Sea are also progressing towards expected startup later in the year. I mentioned that price is a very significant uncertainty to us going forward. If you look at slide 15, you'll see a chart that was put together by WoodMac. This obviously represents a significant source of uncertainty in cash flows going forward. Consistent with many of you, we believe demand will continue to grow. The larger wild card, or uncertainty if you will, is supply. Non-OPEC liquids production, which is shown on this chart, remained much more resilient in 2015 than most predicted. With the significant contraction in global investment caused by low prices, the world would see supplies drop off. WoodMac shows that occurring this year, thereby pushing the oil market into better balance. Until that balance occurs, prices will continue to be constrained and the financial damage to the energy sector seen in 2015 will continue. Relative to balance sheet strength and growing flexibility in our spend, Chevron will be advantaged relative to the others in this industry as prices rebound. We are well positioned to benefit when the market does balance and prices begin to rise because of the leverage that we have and our growing production profile. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\nPhil M. Gresh: Hey, good morning.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nJohn S. Watson: Good morning, Phil.\nPhil M. Gresh: Thanks for all the color today. The dividend coverage priority is obviously key and very clear. On the third quarter call, you built us a bridge to cover the dividend with free cash flow by 2017, which looked fairly reasonable in the $50 or so environment and you highlight the flexibility for 2016 in the slide. So I guess what I was wondering is looking out to 2017, if we're sub $50, how low can you realistically go with additional CapEx and OpEx cuts before you feel like you might need asset sales or the balance sheet to bridge the gap? Is there a level of CapEx you really don't want to go below?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, our flexibility continues to grow, and Phil, we're obviously working that number very closely. The level of spend, if we continue to see the kinds of prices that we're seeing now, the cost of goods and services will continue to decline. We've got the impact of foreign exchange rates, et cetera. The biggest change between what we'll spend this year and next year is really the ramp down from major capital projects. So for example, this year we'll be spending about $6 billion on LNG projects around the world. Obviously finishing Angola LNG, and then as we wind down Gorgon and have a little more to spend on Wheatstone, we expect next year that spend will be under $2 billion. So you gain $4 billion right there, and then our flexibility grows as time goes by. We obviously have to invest to keep our operations reliable. We will still have some projects that are under construction and being completed and additional commitments in drilling off of platforms and things of that sort. But I think our flexibility is significant. We gave you a range of $20 billion to $24 billion, but we're going to continue to drive that number down. I guess my overall message is that we're going to continue to live within our means that we have. And it obviously makes sense to finish the projects under construction. We have a strong balance sheet. And maybe I'll offer a couple of comments in that area, because a lot of people ask. I've given the priority is to pay and grow the dividend, and in order to do that, obviously you do have to invest in the business because we are a depleting resource business. So those are always the first two priorities that we have consistent with good economics on the spending. We've indicated that we're in a long-cycle business. And in such a long-cycle business where you can have ups and downs in the commodity markets and you get started on long-cycle projects, you need a strong balance sheet. And so we have always advertised that and indicated that a AA rating was what we were looking for. And that's really indicative of needing to have a strong balance sheet. But the reason you keep a strong balance sheet is so you can withstand the ups and downs in the business, and right now we're in the downs with prices low. And so we'll use our balance sheet this year, almost regardless of where prices are during the year, and we're going to cut costs. We're going to reduce spend where we can, and that flexibility grows in time. We work very closely with the rating agencies. We've talked to the rating agencies. They see our internal forecasts around our business. They see more than you do, in other words. And so we'll be very clear where our priorities are and where the flexibility is. And then they have to do their job. But we think that we'll retain a very strong balance sheet and the ability to withstand these ups and downs.\nPhil M. Gresh: Okay, that's very helpful, thanks. And then just on the projects, I appreciate all the updates there. Maybe you could just let us know where you stand on the FID for Tengiz, and given what you've been saying about the macro environment and how long it's going to last, where does that stand today?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, well as you know Phil, it's a good question. Tengiz as you know has been a very good business for us in Kazakhstan. We and our partners have had very good relationships there, and we've had a lot of success, financial and otherwise. And the next phase of opportunity there is the wellhead pressure management project and the future growth project. And we've been working this for some time. And we consciously delayed FID when prices came down. We consciously delayed FID so that we could get additional definition around the project, get greater certainty around what the costs would be. And frankly to drive costs down, given the opportunity that is present given conditions in the industry, and we've had some success with that. But we're not at the point where we're ready to take FID today. With low prices that we're seeing, we're working closely with our partners to ensure that we have adequate funding for the project and to further take costs down. We have been pacing investment. We've been doing critical infrastructure work, but we're still working this project to get it in condition for FID. So I think you'll see us continue to pace investments and we'll keep you updated when we can. We do think these projects are good. We do think that they will go forward. But we're continuing to work it to drive costs down and get alignment on financing.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Phil, appreciate it.\nPhil M. Gresh: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question, please.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Hey guys, good morning.\nJohn S. Watson: Good morning, Paul.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Y. Cheng: John, two questions if I may. For 2016 you give a range of $25 billion at the low end and you indicate that given the market condition, you'll most likely to go down to $25 billion. If you really have to, are there are any additional area that you would be willing to cut and drive it down further? And what that area and by how much, or that this is really the minimum that you can go, given the major project spending? The second question if I could is a quick one: We understand that you have one of the strongest balance sheets, but the credit agencies are also becoming increasingly hostile to the energy sector and looks like they may have a sector downgrade anyway. So what may be the minimum credit rating that is acceptable by the company?\nJohn S. Watson: Okay. Well in terms of flexibility, when it comes to capital program, we've given you that range for a good reason. As I indicated, we've got some committed spend that's likely to go forward regardless of the price environment, and really it pertains to the big LNG projects and the projects that are under construction. So we're going to continue to work spend down. And there's always a little bit more flexibility. There's the uncertainty of exchange rates and things of that sort. But I don't want to flag a significant reduction below the range, below the $26.6 billion that's in our budget and below the range that we've talked about, because I don't want to shut in all rigs around the world, for example. There are obviously are things you could do that I don't think are the proper things to do, given our expectations going forward. For example, we've done terrific work in the Permian Basin to get our costs down and we want to keep that momentum going. So we have six operated rigs. There are 14 non-operated rigs. We want to continue that activity. Our group has done a terrific job of getting costs down. And obviously at $30, every business is stressed, but we think that supplies are going to be needed and we want to continue the activity that we have there. Need to continue to drive down costs, but want to continue that activity. So there's a little bit more room, but I don't want to flag something outside the range. Maybe I'll let \u2013 I offered some comments on sort of the philosophy, but maybe I'll let Pat talk a little bit about interaction with the rating agencies and her view on what sort of minimum requirements might be.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so as John said, the rating agencies need to do what the rating agencies need to do and they have conservative oil price scenarios out there and I think that's understandable. If you were in their position, you would be doing the same thing. And I think it's perfectly reasonable to think Chevron, along with everybody in the industry in this particular price environment, would be up for review. They've indicated that many of the companies are up for a review. I'm certain that Chevron will be in that queue right after the first tiering goes through. So if a downgrade does occur, and I think they're moving in that direction, but if that were to occur, we would not be the only one that that would happen to. I don't see it materially impacting our cost of funds or materially impacting our ability to secure financing. And in terms of a minimum, I guess I don't think of it that way. We have a strong balance sheet, even if there were to be a downgrade. We have a very strong balance sheet, amongst the strongest in the industry. And we've already committed and said multiple times that we are going to get balanced. We will live within our cash flows. And I think that is the profile that we put forward to the rating agencies.\nJohn S. Watson: I'll just say, you asked about flexibility on CapEx for 2016. I don't want to suggest there isn't additional flexibility for 2017 and 2018 because there is, particularly if lower prices persist. But we've given you a range that reflects what we think today, based on the forward look. Obviously if conditions remain where they are today, we'll review those numbers just as we would all our other operating statistics.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Thank you.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Paul.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nJason D. Gammel: Thank you, and hi everyone. I just wanted to ask about, as you're reviewing potential capital expenditure reductions, how the deepwater program actually fits into this discussion. Because I note a string of successes in both exploration and appraisal that's occurring in the deepwater right now. So how do you think about that drilling program? And then secondly within the deepwater, how do you see that competing over the medium term? Do you still see that as being within the cost curve based upon your own projections of where oil prices could go?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, Jason, it's a great question and it's one of the areas that I think we and others in the industry are looking at very closely. And I guess if I can take just a second to sort of to back up a little bit. If you look at the macro environment on where supplies are going to come from to meet any demand estimate that might be out there, the world's going to need deepwater oil. It is a significant resource, and over time those barrels are going to be needed. Now, right now the costs in the deepwater haven't come down quite as fast as they have onshore. We obviously have seen some rig rate reductions, but in general as we get to deeper and deeper water, some projects are challenged. We have mentioned last year in our analyst meeting that we felt it would take larger accumulations to make some of these deepwater projects successful, so the precise numbers are being worked. But you're going to need bigger accumulations and larger hubs in order to justify the infrastructure. And then tiebacks similarly will need somewhat higher prices. We have some special charges in the fourth quarter, and $0.5 billion was writing off Buckskin and Moccasin. And that's a project that we thought would go forward. First, we thought it might have the potential to be a hub, and then we thought it had the potential to be a tieback. And I won't say that that project couldn't have gone forward and that it wouldn't meet minimum thresholds depending upon your forward view of prices. But relative to our alternatives, we felt that for the foreseeable future, we've got better places to put our money. And so we made the very difficult decision to not go forward with that project. And so the clock was ticking where it was going to require a couple billion dollars of investments over the next few years. And we just felt over the next few years, we're going to have better places to put our money, notably the Permian. So there are tough choices being made. Now, we have a good position in the deepwater. We've been as successful as anyone there. And we have been successful in driving costs down. We've seen I mean really unbelievable progress last year. We had a 30% reduction in days per 10,000 feet in 2015 versus 2014. So our experience in the lower tertiary, in particular, we're getting better and better at understanding it and driving costs down. We're encouraged by what we've got at Anchor. We've got some appraisal work that's undergoing there. We've got another potential hub development with a group of fields that we had put together with a couple of partners in the industry to try to create a hub class development. But this is a work in progress for us to make sure we can have a resource cost balance to make these projects attractive to meet our thresholds. I'm confident we'll be able to do that. It's just we were pushed with Buckskin and Moccasin, and you're seeing others make similar choices if it doesn't quite fit relative to their alternatives.\nJason D. Gammel: Appreciate those thoughts, John. If I could ask a real quick follow-up. The $1.1 billion write-down that you had in the upstream, are you able to provide any split between exploration and depreciation on that?\nJohn S. Watson: Why don't I let Pat give you a little bit of color on some of those. Because you're right, it's important to know which. It does hit multiple lines on the income statement, and you saw that those numbers were up a little bit.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so I would just say for the full year, if you look at the income statement, the X, the special items that are categorized under exploration expense would be about $1.1 billion. And if you look at the full year for DD&A off the income statement, the special items amount to about $3.5 billion.\nJason D. Gammel: That's great. Thanks very much, folks.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Good morning. I think you're going to get 17 different questions on the same theme, but just you talked about $20 billion, $24 billion of CapEx in 2017 and 2018, and I think on the last call you mentioned sort of a slower rate of growth, 1% to 1.5%. Obviously that rate of growth would also help project execution and hopefully costs will come down. If you were to go down to a lower number of terminal sort of CapEx for a period, maybe just talk a bit about the growth implications beyond 2017. How would it affect the growth rate? And then I have a follow-on.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, I'm not sure I'll be answer to that fully here. I think we'll probably give you, we will give you a more complete answer when we get to March where we have a chance to run through it. But I would just say, if you look at growth not just through 2017, but through 2018, we feel pretty good about it. And that's largely a function of the projects we have in flight. In 2018, you'll have a full year of production obviously from our big LNG projects, which you won't have in 2017. We also have other projects that remain under construction now that will come on during that period, projects like Hebron in Canada and Big Foot and others that will come on in that window. So we'll have continuing momentum from those projects, and we'll be ramping up our shale activity during that period, notably in the Permian. So I think the profile will be attractive beyond 2017. Now ultimately the cumulative effect of the reductions in capital, if they persist at a low level, will be felt. But I think we'll have a little more resilience than people think. Now, that's other things being equal, depending upon where prices are, depending upon asset sales and things of that sort. But in terms of what sort of spend do you need to sustain production indefinitely, that would be a function of a lot of things, notably the cost environment that we see. I do think that our position in the Permian gives us a little bit of an advantage over others during this period because you've seen some of the numbers we've given you previously. We have the capability to ramp that up and mitigate some of the declines. So even if we see a slight increase in our base decline, which has been tracking at under 2%, even if that goes up a little bit, we should be able to substantially mitigate a lot of that through the activity that we have in the shale. But we'll try to give you a little longer-term outlook in our upcoming meeting in March if that's okay. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) And then the follow-on is on the OpEx and SG&A part of that reduction of 13% to 18% from $61 billion down to a lower number. I mean, obviously the market helps give you some OpEx and then there's some structural changes that you've made, some difficult decisions. I mean, should we think that there's another big structural shift that you can make to maybe even outpace the market in terms of OpEx and SG&A reductions, say into 2017?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, we're working really hard and we're pulling all levers. Obviously, though, the cost in goods and services in our procurement group is having a fair degree of success. I will say we've had more success in the US than internationally, number one. And so we'll continue to drive that hard. That's just a function of contracts and the competitive environment overseas. So one, we'll be working that very hard. We'll be working additional efficiencies. Just as an example, we still have reorganizations in flight. So our employee count was down about 3,200 between the end of 2014 to the end of 2015. There are another 4,000 coming this year and a lot of that work is ongoing right now. So we're being careful. We're pretty thoughtful about the way we do this sort of work to make sure that we keep the right people in our organization for the longer term. But the reality is activity is likely to be lower and we do have a number of projects that we'll be ramping down. Now, we're going to work to be fair about how we do that so that we keep a lot of the great talent that we have that's been working around the world. But there's no question we're looking at organizations and have a number of reorganizations in flight. So our desire is to keep moving that. Now, I will say on a dollar basis, when you're growing production and bringing on new assets, you have operating expense that you will incur. That's why we gave you the unit OpEx number. But we drove that one down. There's still some final allocations for what goes in the 10-K in the oil and gas disclosure, but it's down over $2 per barrel and I think that general trend, we're going to continue to drive that number down. Remember in our OpEx, 40% of our OpEx is downstream. And our downstream had record performance this year, and as you know they've had restructuring under way for some time. And it's not that they're immune from some of the efforts we have to reduce costs, but I don't think you'll see a structural shift in our downstream costs. The corporate center we've obviously looked at and made some significant changes. A lot of people left the payroll in December, and so those benefits will be felt and the ongoing work that I've described in the upstream. So my message is we're driving it hard, but we're trying to be thoughtful so that we keep the talent we need for the long haul in the organization. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Makes sense, thank you.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Ed.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI Group. Your question, please.\nDoug Terreson: I wanted to get some clarity on the 0% to 4% growth projection and the point that John made a few minutes ago about higher decline rates. And specifically, is it reasonable to assume that we're going to have growth this year from the United States, Africa and Australia and declines elsewhere? Is that the accurate way to think about it?\nJohn S. Watson: Africa, Australia, and the United States.\nDoug Terreson: Yeah.\nJohn S. Watson: I think that is a pretty good way to look at it. We tend to look at it by project. But we do have obviously the shale and tight that's growing and ongoing ramp up in the deepwater. Obviously, the projects in Australia and then Angola, and volume from Angola LNG. So I think that's a pretty good characterization of it, yes.\nDoug Terreson: Okay. Okay. And then also, John, on the neutral zone, there's been some more commentary on progress and so my question is, is the project real to your knowledge? And if it is, if we are seeing progress underway, what period of time could those fields return to full production if in fact there was movement, meaning is this something we should think about in terms of weeks or months or quarters? So just an update there would be appreciated.\nJohn S. Watson: I'm sorry, I missed the first part of it, which location?\nDoug Terreson: Yeah, John, on the neutral zone there's been some commentary.\nJohn S. Watson: Sorry. Yeah, in the Partitioned Zone, look, I gave you guys a long explanation last quarter. The fields, they're still shut in and there have been ongoing dialogue between the Saudis and the Kuwaitis. And as I described before, there's plenty of incentive to bring those fields back online and I probably have to leave it there.\nDoug Terreson: Okay.\nJohn S. Watson: What I'll tell you, implicit in our assumption is about, is a mid-year startup. The middle of that range includes a mid-year startup, but remember 2014 production was about 80,000 barrels a day. When you start up mid year, you don't start up at 80,000, you start out at something lower than that because the facilities have been mothballed and preserved for a period of time. So that's what's reflected. To the extent that agreement is reached, and there have been discussions, to the extent agreement is reached and it's started up sooner, it'll be to the higher end of that range and to the extent that it continues, the bottom of the range is zero if they don't start up at all this year.\nDoug Terreson: Okay, fair enough, John. Thanks a lot.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks, good morning everybody.\nFrank Mount: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: John, I know I've kind of tried this one before, but in light of the further collapse in oil prices, I wanted to ask again about growth versus growth per share. And what's really behind my question is whether investing in a highly uncertain environment in what I'm guessing are potentially sub-economic assets, is it an argument just for outright deferral and outright declines that can be picked up again through share buybacks, if indeed oil prices did recover absent any major capital commitments? I'm just wondering philosophically how you think about that, given the potential risk to your credit rating that we stand right now.\nJohn S. Watson: No Doug, actually I think it's a fair question. I mean the message I've been trying to convey is that we are dramatically cutting investment going forward. We all have to make estimates of what oil and gas prices will be going forward, but in terms of longer-cycle projects, we aren't initiating any. As I've described, we've got some momentum in the system from projects under construction, but we are, you are going to see us preferentially favor short-cycle investments. And if they don't meet our hurdles, we won't invest. Taken to the extreme, we're not just going to invest to hold volume. We're going to invest where we think we can get good returns. And so we've repurchased shares in the past and we'll do that again. We won't fund opportunities that we don't think will be effective for the company. And you and I can both put some hindsight on some of the things that we and others in the industry have put money in right now, but we're tightly scrutinizing what we're spending right now. And I hope I can make that really clear to you. I mean, that's indicative of the kinds of choices we made with Buckskin Moccasin. It's indicative of the kind of changes we've made with a big development in the North Sea. That's the direction that we're going, again trying to balance our expectations for the forward curve.\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate your answer, John. I know it's not fun for anyone right now. My follow-up is really, I don't know who wants to take this, but it's on the asset sales. There seems to be, everybody and their grandmother seems to be looking to sell assets right now. I'm just wondering if you could characterize how you see the depth of the market, and whether or not you think you can still execute on that program. And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, no, that's a real good question. In fact, I think your point is spot-on. I think it's a terrible market to be trying to sell most assets out there, particularly obviously oil-related assets. And that's why I've been pretty circumspect around asset sales. We sold $11 billion over the last two years, but we're giving you a $5 billion to $10 billion for the next two years in the numbers that I've given you. And from a strategic point of view, there's some opportunities out there that I think will be tough to execute. And if we can't execute them, we won't sell them. If you look at the kinds of things we have sold, we've gotten very good value. So for example over the last two years, there was a lot of strength in the infrastructure market selling pipelines, for example. And on strategy grounds and on valuation grounds, we felt that we were going to limit our investments in the pipeline business to those that are critical to our upstream and downstream sector and we can sell those. Things like Caltex Australia, we thought values were very strong and assets had \u2013 we'd been very well aligned with them, but they were heading off potentially in a growth direction. And we felt that from our strategic point of view that it'd be best to exit when we did. So we've been very careful. And I can tell you the assets going forward, we don't advertise them, but if you look at the ones where there's information in the public domain, I think you'll see that those are assets where there are potential buyers out there at good value. So I think your admonition is a very good one, and it's why we haven't put big numbers out there.\nDoug Leggate: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nFrank Mount: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nEvan Calio: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJohn S. Watson: Good morning.\nFrank Mount: Good morning, Evan.\nEvan Calio: Hey, John, you answered the Tengiz question before, yet are there any FIDs that are currently baked into 2016 and your 2017 to 2018 budget ranges? And I guess as it relates to CapEx, I mean how much flexibility is there to open or reprice contracts within projects post-FID? It appears to be there's more flexibility than at least what we had perceived?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously for any project we had in flight, we went back to all the project teams and created an expectation that they will look to try to capture cost reductions. In some cases where you've bid contracts and the terms and conditions are fixed, you are where you are. But on anything where you have not taken FID, you have some flexibility to go back to the providers of those services. And that's why we've delayed our costs. I mean, part of the recycle of the projects is to see if there's a different development scheme and things like that. For example, Rosebank has a different development scheme. But part of it is also to be sure you can capture the cost reductions that are available, that might be available in the marketplace. And sometimes you have to just say we're not going to do this if we don't get better costs, and that tends to focus partners and others. So we expect to see declining breakevens as a result of those initiatives, both to reframe projects in some cases, or to try to drive costs out. In terms of what we've got actually planned, most of the effort, most of the things that we would call FIDs are really things like infill drilling. So for example, the next phase of drilling at Agbami, the next phase of drilling at Jack/St. Malo, which are utilizing existing rigs and drilling off of existing to support existing infrastructure. In terms of big new greenfield projects, it's relatively few. There are some that could be in the budget, but it's going to depend on that price/cost balance I've been talking about. And that's why I say we have significant flexibility going forward as we complete things like Gorgon, Wheatstone, Mafumeira Sul, Angola LNG and others.\nEvan Calio: Great, so it sounds like they're not currently in the budget. Let me just add a follow-up question or a smaller item. Are the startup volumes at Gorgon, are they at spot or contract pricing, and can you give us any color or update on the spot LNG market and whether you see an ability to term up any incremental uncontracted Gorgon volumes? And I'll leave it at that.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, in general the sales will be under contract. In fact, you've probably seen recently we have signed a couple of additional HOAs. We said all along that we thought that it's appropriate to have about 85% under long-term contract for Gorgon and Wheatstone. And with those HOAs, assuming those turn into SBAs, we'll be over 80%. So we feel pretty good about that. And those are medium-term type contracts that we've put in place. So we feel good about it. But during the ramp up, we've got contracts that are available for these volumes. Now as far as the overall LNG market, it's lousy. When you look at spot cargos and prices, and I expect we're going to go through a challenging, as an industry, we're going to go through a challenging period for any volumes that will be sold spot into the marketplace.\nEvan Calio: Appreciate it.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Evan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nRyan Todd: Great, thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Question, maybe you've talked kind of indirectly a bit about your view towards the short cycle on the US onshore in the near term, and I appreciate some of that color. But can you talk about trends and activity levels and volumes, in particularly in the Permian? And I guess just in a broader sense how you look to manage the short cycle spend over the near to medium term. I mean it sounds like it's clearly taking preference over long-cycle spend, but what's dictating the difference between spending $3 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion and so on? How do you manage that over the medium term?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, it's a fair question. I mean the short answer is there's some judgment that we're applying. We have been on a pathway in the Permian of first assessing what we have. So we've been drilling both vertical and horizontal wells. Over the last year, we've really converted our entire program to horizontal wells, and really getting, an overused term, but getting our factory model in place. And we've done that. And our costs are now very competitive with some of the best in the business. So that is taking place and we want to continue that effort. Our view is not that prices are going to stay at the low range they are today. But part of living within your means is limiting just how many rigs you deploy. We've got six operated rigs today. We got 14 in our JV rigs that are operating today, and we think that's about the right balance. We have flexibility to move up. And what I've told our people, if they stay on the cost trajectory that they are, we're going to look to fund them. The economics in some of the best areas at strip type prices work. They're not as good as we'd like at higher prices, but they work. And so that obviously is guiding us, but I would hate to lose the momentum that we have in the Permian with some of the cost reduction efforts we have under way. We've told you, we got 3,000 locations that we think meet economic threshold at $50. So obviously, prices aren't $50 today, but it's indicative of the strength of the portfolio that we have.\nRyan Todd: Great. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one kind of step-back question. We spend a lot of time these days talking about how rough everything is and all the costs that are having to be cut. But maybe if you tick around and just look at the other side, can you address any positives or opportunities that you're seeing? I mean, a resetting of the cost structure is clearly one, but anything that you're seeing emerge as you look towards your position in your business for the next cycle, some of the positive things whether it's resource capture or fiscal terms, or any other opportunities that are kind of a silver lining of what we're seeing right now?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, thank you for a silver lining question. We're looking for those internally too. You're right, it is very tough times. A couple thoughts that I'll give you. One, I think the cost reductions we're going after, most of them will be permanent. For example, the efficiencies that we've gained in our drilling, those are permanent regardless of what happens to rig rates going forward, so whether it's a deepwater that I talked about earlier or onshore. So that's number one. Number two, I think the benefits that we're taking on in some of our organizations and some of our structures, I think a lot of that will be permanent, and I think we've undervalued what simplicity in org structures can provide. So obviously we're taking out some layers. We've got rolling reorganizations that are being implemented around the world, and I think that simplicity and clarity will be a positive for the business. In terms of resource capture, there are better opportunities today than there might have been a year ago. And the balance between what I'll say the expectations and value of resources getting better aligned. So there are opportunities emerging. I mean, our priority is obviously the things I've been talking about this morning. But we are in a resource business and you do want to be attentive to the opportunities that are out there.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Ryan.\nRyan Todd: Good. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nNeil Singhvi Mehta: Hey, good morning.\nJohn S. Watson: Good morning.\nNeil Singhvi Mehta: John, you made the comment that non-OPEC supply has been relatively resilient over the course of the year. You also made the point that the base decline rates was less than 2% in your portfolio over the course of this year. How does that compare relative to history? And as you look at 2016, how do you think your base decline rate looks like towards the midpoint of guidance?\nJohn S. Watson: In general, I mean the two are somewhat related. Our base decline has been good because we've operated very reliably and we've actually gotten quite efficient in our business. So we have been able to mitigate the declines. We've also flagged though, that with the lower level of spending on base business, infill drilling in places like Bakersfield and elsewhere, you are going to see declines slightly higher. And so that's why we've suggested that, and we do expect to see that across the industry. The history has shown during downturns like this, you can see an increase of 1% or 2% industry-wide in that base decline, so that is, I think that's clear. In terms of the resiliency that we've seen in production, it's partly related to that. But to me it's been, if you look at 2015, the impact of projects that were in flight has probably been more than we as an industry anticipated. So we're not the only ones with Jack/St. Malos and Bibiyanas and other projects that are under construction that are coming up. Secondly of course, you've had the impact of hedges in the unconventional business, and the brief uptick that took place in the middle of 2015 in prices did allow some additional hedges. So you've still got a few hedges that are out there in the industry in 2016 that will allow some level of activity. But increasingly, all that's wearing off as all the projects come online, as base business declines start to take over and as hedges are no longer available. And so I think that's why you're seeing those volumes. The other piece that I've consistently said has been underrepresented is the stress around the world, the stress on host governments, the stress on those government partners, national oil companies and others. And you've seen announcements that have been made because while we tend to think of living within our means as a function of forward capital spend, for host governments living within their means is social, the choice between social spending and reinvesting in the business. And you've seen some of those choices play out in the guidance that's been given by host governments to national oil companies in certain countries. So I think the cumulative weight of all this action will tend to bring things into balance. You still have potential sources of supply out there. Obviously Iran is bringing volumes on, but I think the trend is inexorable.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Neil.\nNeil Singhvi Mehta: Thanks, Frank.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, good morning, everybody. John, you've part answered this question. My original question was going back to the volumes. It looks like quite a big percentage range, but in barrels a day it's only about 100,000 barrels a day for 2016, that's to say the 0% to 4% range of uncertainty. You part answered the question because you addressed the partitioned neutral zone. Can you talk a bit about the variances in the other elements, so how much volume potentially variances there in the startups, the divestments, the price effects and the spend levels? Because it feels like that 100,000 variance actually is not that wide. It seems big in percentage but not so much volume. Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, that's a very good observation. The range is wide. And you've got multiple moving parts in the business. Let me see if I can give you a little bit of color.\nPaul Sankey: Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: Just if you look at the difference between $30 and $60 per barrel, just on price effects, it can be over 100,000 barrels a day for that alone. And so you're right, there is a range there. And what happens in a place like Indonesia for example, for a given level of spend and you have cost barrel reimbursement, the lower the price, the more barrels you get. And these curves aren't all linear in different locations around the world, so there is considerable variability from price alone. If you think about ramp-up of production, I'll give you an example on Gorgon. Gorgon, the three trains at Gorgon, our share is a little over 200,000 barrels a day. So if you think about each train is 65,000 to 70,000 barrels a day, and we've said that we expect production to commence within a few weeks. There's an industry curve. There are industry averages around ramp-up schedule that takes place over a period of months. To the extent you're at the high end of that range where you have a smooth startup, we have the well capacity, so you could have a very rapid ramp-up. Our people in Australia don't know what they don't know and so we have taken more of an average approach. And to the extent you encounter something unusual, you can be on the downside of that. Our people in Angola LNG at this point are pretty gun shy because we've had challenges, but that's 60,000 barrels a day. And we've said that we expect to be introducing gas later this quarter and to have cargos in the second quarter, but there's variability around that in the ramp-up. And so all of those \u2013 and by the way, there's a second train at Gorgon as well later this year. So all of those can impact the pace of development. And then there's just the outright spend that's a function of rigs and activity. I think it's fair to say that if we keep seeing prices in the low $30s, we're going to drop rigs as the price moves on. And the last piece, and it's one that I won't provide much in the way of specifics, is really divestments. Because we've indicated for example that our shallow water, our shelf activities that we have packages for sale out there, and those have some volumes attached to them. And then there's some other potential assets in the upstream that are under consideration, but it really depends on getting value and the timing of those. And so that is why you get a range. And you are correct, the range can be broader than indicated there. But I felt if I gave you any broader range, you'd say this wasn't very helpful.\nPaul Sankey: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alistair Syme from Citi. Your question, please.\nAlastair R. Syme: Thanks very much. John, can I just come back to your comment on the divestment market. You said it's a terrible market for selling assets, therefore I guess it must be a great market for buying. Appreciate the balance sheet constraints, but what leads you away from temptation?\nJohn S. Watson: What leads me away from temptation. Well just, I know you've heard me over the years, but if I just to ground everyone that's on the phone, we've said over many years that we're in the resource business. It's declining, and we'll replace resource through a combination of exploration, discovered resource participation and acquisitions. And Chevron has done that over time. Our growth position has been pretty good, and so M&A hasn't been a particular priority for us. But we are mindful of the opportunities that are out there. I wouldn't want you to think our focus is anything other than getting the projects we have under construction, and completing the work we have and ramping up the assets that we have, because I think we've got a pretty nice business profile going forward. But we do need to look at what is out there and we're going to be value driven. But there are opportunities that could present themselves in the current market. So we'll be mindful of that. But remember, we're trying to grow the dividend and invest for the long term here, and so we're not driven, we're not particularly transaction driven in any period of time. I have time for one more question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Asit Sen from CSLA. Your question, please.\nAsit Sen: Thanks, good morning. A quick one on shale, if I may, and tight oil. On slide 23 of the presentation, the year-over-year production bridge, shale and tight oil is shown as an impressive 44,000 barrels a day in 2015. What was the split between Permian and Vaca Muerta? And also can we get a full year 2015 shale and tight oil production for Chevron?\nJohn S. Watson: The increase, of that 44,000, about two-thirds of it was Permian Wolfcamp, and the rest of it was between Argentina and some of our Appalachia activity. And in terms of what's forward looking, I think I'm going to leave that to the security analyst meeting that we've coming up in March, where we'll give you a little deeper insight into our work in the Permian and kind of the range of ramp-up that we can see there. And we've done that every year, and we'll update you this year based on both the cost improvements that we've seen and then realities of the price market that we're in. Okay.\nAsit Sen: Thanks, John, and since we have you, one macro question on Iran. And you already talked an Iran ramp-up. And are you involved in any discussion that's been mentioned by your European peers?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, I'll answer the second question first, no. We're not able to do that, so we don't. I would just say that we've got our hands pretty well full. We always look at opportunities when it's legal for us to do so around the world, but I don't have any particular insight into Iran. You've seen the range of speculation around their ability to ramp up production. Some have speculated that it's going to be a little harder than advertised, but I don't have any particular insight to offer you. And perhaps others can help you with that.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay, I would like to thank all of you for being on the call today. We appreciate your interest in our company and your participation. We look forward to seeing you at our March meeting in New York. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2015, "date": "2015-10-30 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Vice President and CFO, who you know very well, and Frank Mount, our General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on our website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you read that cautionary statement that is on slide 2. I will now turn the call over to Pat, who will take you through our financials, briefly. Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. Thanks, John. I'll be presenting four slides on third quarter results. Our normal earnings and production variance slides are available in the appendix section of the presentation, which is available on our website. Starting now with slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. Third quarter earnings were $2 billion, or $1.09 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and impairments, earnings totaled $1.9 billion, or $1.01 per share. On this basis, third quarter results were modestly better than second quarter, despite a much weaker oil market. This reconciliation is also available in the appendix. Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.4 billion. Our debt ratio at quarter end was just under 19%. During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we declared a $1.07 per share dividend, payable in the fourth quarter. This takes our 2015 annual dividend to $4.28 per share and makes 2015 the 28th consecutive year where we have increased annual per-share dividend payments. Turning to slide 4, cash generated from operations was $5.4 billion during the third quarter and nearly $15 billion year-to-date. Downstream cash generation strength was sustained in the third quarter, while upstream cash flow fell, commensurate with an approximate 20% drop in global oil prices between quarters. As of September 30th, working capital effects reduced 2015 operating cash flow by $2.3 billion. Year-to-date proceeds from asset sales were $5.4 billion, bringing our total over the last seven quarters to more than $11 billion. We are tracking very well against our four-year asset divestment target of $15 billion. Cash capital expenditures were $6.8 billion for the quarter, $800 million lower than second quarter. Year-to-date cash capital expenditures were $22 billion, down $3.6 billion or 14% compared to the same period in 2014. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents were $13.2 billion, and our net debt position was $22.6 billion. Debt issuance through nine months has amounted to $8 billion. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2015 earnings were approximately $3.6 billion lower than third quarter 2014 results. Upstream earnings decreased $4.6 billion between quarters, virtually all of this related to significantly lower realizations between periods. Downstream results increased by $824 million, primarily driven by higher margins and favorable foreign exchange effects, partially offset by the absence of third quarter 2014 gains on asset sales. The variance in the other segment was mainly lower environmental reserve additions, in particular, the absence of a reserve taken last year in the third quarter related to a closed mining operation. I will now compare results for the third quarter 2015 with the second quarter of 2015. Third quarter earnings were $1.5 billion higher than second quarter results. Upstream earnings increased by 2.3 billion, primarily reflecting the absence of second quarter impairments and other related charges worth $2.6 billion. Lower realizations reduced earnings between quarters, but a favorable swing in foreign exchange and lower exploration expenses were largely offsetting. Downstream earnings decreased $745 million, mainly due to the absence of a $1.7 billion in asset sale gains recorded in the second quarter. The current quarter also saw stronger margins and volumes, particularly in the U.S., favorable foreign exchange impacts, as well as lower operating expenses and positive timing effects in the face of declining prices. The variance in the other segment was primarily unfavorable tax items, partially offset by lower corporate charges. John will now provide an update on the current priorities and focus areas.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay. Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide 7, I would like to start by reinforcing that our priorities \u2013 financial priorities are unchanged. Our first priority is to maintain the dividend and grow it as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. As Pat mentioned, we announced our quarterly dividend earlier this week and are very proud of the fact that we've increased the annual per-share payout for 28 consecutive years. Back in March, we committed to delivering free cash flow to cover the dividend in 2017. At that time, the futures market was envisioning $70 prices in 2017. Today, the futures market is lower, but our intent remains the same. Our goal is to balance our cash equation by completing projects under construction and reducing capital spend and operating expenses to levels consistent with the current market conditions. We will also continue to divest assets where we can obtain good value. We will achieve this while operating all businesses safely and reliably. I'll address each topic on this slide on the slides that follow. First, a little bit of an overview on the market. It's clear that low prices have reduced upstream earnings for the sector, and, for Chevron, we're no exception. Prices are low because the market is producing more than consumers want, but the markets are showing signs of rebalancing. Using Wood Mac data, this chart depicts worldwide liquid supply with the black line and demand in red. The blue represents the shortfall from or surplus to inventory. In the early part of the decade, the pattern was clear. Supply could not keep up with demand, in part because of supply disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa. The success of shale in the U.S. and some growing production from Iraq allowed the market to rebalance for first several months of 2014. However, note the spike in production when the Saudis increased production and the shale growth continued its surge in late 2014. The resultant 2 million barrels per day surplus has pushed prices down. Suppliers are adjusting. World production peaked and turned down last month. U.S. production, particularly shales, has peaked and is now in decline. We expect this trend to continue and accelerate at current prices. Demand is strong, as low prices provide stimulus to the consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere, leading to annual growth of 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day. Markets will likely rebalance at some point next year, though seasonal demand patterns are apt to blur the exact timing. With a new equilibrium will come price recovery, which is one of the levers that will help balance our cash equation. While we're confident in a price recovery, the timing, of course, is uncertain. We're taking actions that will allow Chevron to compete effectively in a low price environment while positioning us effectively for value growth over the longer term. Turn to slide 9. A second lever to help us balance cash flow is volume growth. As most are aware, we expect to see a significant inflection point over the next two years as a number of major capital projects move from being cash consumers to cash generators. Gorgon and Wheatstone are obvious contributors, but the list is long, starting with Lianzi in West Africa. Over the next several quarters, we expect a progression of start-ups that will include Angola LNG, Mafumeira Sul, Moho Nord, Sonam \u2013 all these are in West Africa. Chuandongbei in China, the Bangka development in Indonesia, Alder in the North Sea, the Chevron fields chemical project on the U.S. Gulf Coast and, of course, three trains at Gorgon and two trains at Wheatstone. Our strong shale and tight portfolio, particularly in the Permian, gives us low-cost, short-cycle investment opportunities that nicely supplement production growth from the major capital projects. In the shale and tight class, our focus is on high grading our investment opportunities to maximize returns and cash flow. We like our portfolio diversity, which, when market conditions improve, will provide growth opportunities. In slide 10, we're in the final stages of commissioning systems to allow start-up of Train 1 at Gorgon. At the plant, our focus is on starting up the process units ahead of commencing liquefaction. An LNG cool down cargo is planned to arrive mid-December to assist in cooling down the LNG tanks and associated facilities prior to first LNG export. The Jansz-Io Field sub-C infrastructure is fully complete. We've opened the first two wells to the Jansz pipeline confirming the full operability of these sub-C systems. Our current outlook for loading the first LNG cargo is early 2016. We are continuing to make good progress on Trains 2 and 3, with all Train 2 and nine of 13 Train 3 modules installed and hookups under way. At Wheatstone, all sub-C infrastructure and over 100 kilometers of flowlines have been installed. Hookup and commissioning of the offshore platform continues on plan. All nine wells are drilled with the top of the reservoir, with four of nine wells now completed and sub-C trees installed. At the plant, 17 of the 24 modules required for first LNG have been delivered and all refrigeration compressors and gas turbine generators have been installed. Installation of all pipe racks and electrical switchgear buildings on the product loading facility is now complete, as is start-up of the power systems in the plant operations center. We're still targeting the first LNG cargo by year-end 2016, however we continue to work to mitigate Wheatstone schedule pressures from previous delays in module delivery. We've posted some new pictures today, and I encourage you to look at them on our investor website at Chevron.com. Turn to slide 11. Another lever to deliver free cash flow is reduce capital spending. As indicated during our March Analyst Day, we have significant flexibility in our capital program as we complete projects under construction. Given the near-term price outlook, we're exercising more discretion and pacing projects that have not reached final investment decision. We are also negotiating cost reductions from suppliers. Overall, our investment programs are being set at levels that will enable us to complete and ramp-up the projects under construction, fund high-return, short-cycle investments, preserve options for viable, long-cycle projects, and finally ensure safe, reliable operations. We expect capital exploratory spend in 2016 to be in the range of $25 billion to $28 billion, down from $35 billion this year. We expect further reductions in 2017 and 2018 into the $20 billion to $24 billion range depending on business conditions. Of specific note, the plan does include funding for the wellhead pressure management and future growth project at Tengiz in Kazakhstan, which has undergone rigorous engineering and readiness reviews based on learnings from other projects. Turn to slide 12, to another cash flow improvement lever. We're working on reducing cost across the company and are beginning to see the results. Compared to prior-year day periods, enterprise operating costs are 7% lower. In the third quarter to third quarter comparison, they're 12% lower. On another basis, year-to-date upstream unit operating expenses are down 13% versus last year. At this point, we have identified spend reductions of approximately $4 billion on an annual full run rate basis. About half of this is coming through organizational reviews and portfolio rationalization. And about half working through the supply chain. On the organizational side, lower investment activity, portfolio changes and efficiency reviews across the upstream, gas and midstream and the corporate and service company groups are expected to result in employee reductions of between 6,000 to 7,000. A similar number of contractor reductions are anticipated over the same period. Supply chain initiatives including rate reductions, greater equipment standardization, project re-scoping, and timing optimization are expected to contribute approximately$2 billion also on an annual run rate basis. An example, we're leveraging our enterprise spend for drill pipe across the company and we're seeing cost reductions of up to 35%. These supply chain benefits will show up as lower operating expense, lower capital expenditures, and lower cost to goods sold. Finally, we're seeing efficiency improvements throughout the organization, which are driving improved value capture. As an example, in the last year, we have seen the drilling cycle time from spud to rig release reduced by 55% within our Permian horizontal drilling program. Turning to slide 13, a final cash flow lever is asset sales. These are a normal part of portfolio work and contribute proceeds to help manage the balance sheet. We divest assets that no longer have a strategic fit or where we no longer see the cost-effective application of our technology, where future investments do not compete for capital within our portfolio and where we can obtain good value. So there are a number of drivers on asset sales. As you know, we made a commitment to generate $15 billion from the asset sales program from 2014 through 2017, and over the last seven quarters, we made real good progress and achieved $11 billion of this goal. From today out through 2017, we could see another $10 billion in sales proceeds. There's a range around this new expectation because of uncertainties on future market conditions. We're only going to sell assets where we can obtain good value. Turn to slide 14. We expect to end this year within the production guidance range we provided back in January. Over the next couple of years, you will see the growth projects we've talked about for some time come onstream. Gorgon and Wheatstone and Angola LNG are collectively expected to provide the majority of our volume growth. This growth will not be realized at one time as there's a ramp-up over three years and there's variability depending upon start date. We expect offshore projects, the majority coming from West Africa, also to be a significant part of our growth. Our projected shale and tight ramp-up is steady, though the current price environment is expected to lead to a slower pace of growth than we anticipated at our March Analyst Day. Similarly, our future base business spending is influenced by the current environment and its impact on economics and partner funding capabilities. We anticipate lower base business spending and, as a result, expect to see higher decline rates compared to our more recent pattern. Under these assumptions, we're anticipating a 13% to 15% increase in production from year-end 2015 to a range of between 2.9 million and 3 million barrels per day in 2017. In 2018, we expect volume growth momentum to continue, largely because of project ramp-up schedules. Note, this range excludes the impact of divestments. Their specific timing is difficult to predict. Actual production growth is also dependent upon production sharing contract effects and the Partitioned Zone restart timing. We will issue further guidance for 2016 production as we normally would in January. Turning to slide 15, that brings me back where I started. We like the go-forward prospect for energy as we are constructive on the long-term price outlook, but sober about the current realities of lower prices. We have consistent and clear financial priorities. We are taking significant action to balance the cash equations and cover the dividend with free cash flow by 2017. We expect to deliver volume growth and emerge on the other side of this downturn leaner and better. All of our actions are geared toward delivering value through dividend growth and stock price appreciation. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question come from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Hi. Good morning.\nJohn S. Watson: Good morning, Phil.\nPhilip M. Gresh: John, thanks for the full update here. My first question is that one of the criticisms I continue to hear from investors about big oil is that most of the companies in the industry are just trying to manage two dividend coverage at a point in the cycle rather than through the cycle. And I fully appreciate Chevron has a full stable of capital projects over these past few years, so the spending flexibility is very high. But I was hoping you could just help us tie this new capital spending guidance to what kind of underlying capital spending would be required to keep production flat or what kind of long-term growth rate you think Chevron could achieve using this lower capital base?\nJohn S. Watson: It's a fair question. We do try to invest through the cycle. We got into a period at the early part of this decade where we had some good projects that were frankly stacked up on top of one another. We thought it was the right time to take Gorgon forward. We had good contracts in place. And, frankly, it was somewhat countercyclical when we started in 2009, very late in 2009. Wheatstone, very similar. We thought it was a good market and we needed to move that one as well. We also had Gulf of Mexico projects that following the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico, came on \u2013 we started it at the same time. So we went through a period of capital spend that was pretty high. We thought these were very good projects, but there's no doubt that we were going through a period of heavy capital spend. And we kept our balance sheet pretty strong to enable us to withstand the ups and downs that we see in the market. Now, we saw prices rise dramatically, and then we've seen them come back down a little harder than we thought, so we do have to manage through this cycle. But I think we've been able to weather that pretty well. We are completing the projects that we've got. We're working to preserve the options that we have on some of the nice opportunities we have going forward. But we do have to live within our means here, and if you look at the \u2013 as you know very well, when we look at the pattern of dividends, it's a nice, smooth pattern with increases over 28 years. The pattern of earnings is a lot more volatile during that period, depending upon commodity prices. So we do invest through the cycle with some of these long projects, we have to be able to do that. But we have had a period of heavy spend for \u2013 that we've had to go through. So there is an adjustment when prices go from 100 to 50, and we're just having to deal with that. But, certainly, we're investing through the cycle, but making some adjustments to deal with the low prices we've got.\nPhilip M. Gresh: And is there a specific growth rate you think you can achieve with this new spending base?\nJohn S. Watson: Well \u2013 certainly, we're going to see disproportionately strong growth through 2017, frankly, into 2018 that, we think, will be very good. Long-term, overall, hydrocarbons are growing in the 1% to 1.5% range. And so that's probably a more reasonable expectation going forward, but frankly we make our investment decisions based on what we can do that is economic. If you look at the history for companies our size, growing at something significantly greater than where aggregate demand for oil and gas is growing is pretty hard to do. And, frankly, we'll be guided by what we think we can do economically. We'll give you a little bit more information on what we think post-2017 as we finalize our business plan. We're still grinding \u2013 the reason we gave you a range on some of these capital numbers is we're still grinding through that business plan right now to be sure we strike the right balance, and that level of spending will dictate what the growth will be in some of the out years. Just so you have some confidence, though, I made specific comments on the future growth project, the Wellhead Pressure Management project in Tengiz, as one example of investing through the cycle. And that's a significant project, which we're working through final details with government and partner. But we're doing a lot of early work on that project, and that's one that, as we take final investment decision, we won't see the production from that until the next decade. And so that and other investments will provide growth going forward.\nUnknown Speaker: Thanks, Phil.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Sure, Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Thank you. Hey, guys. Good morning.\nUnknown Speaker: Good morning, Paul.\nUnknown Speaker: How are you doing, Paul?\nPaul Y. Cheng: Very good. Thank you. John, two questions. One is really short, and let me go for that first. With the \u2013 the CapEx is saying that the base operation decline rate will be higher. I think, for the last five years you guys have been about 3% to 4%. Do you have a new number for us?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah. Actually, we've been better than that. Our base business has been more like 1%. It's been less than 2%, certainly, during that period, and we see it being more like 3%. And so, frankly, if you take just the difference between about 1% and 3% and apply it to our base level of production, you get a little bit lower production than you might have seen otherwise.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Okay. Excellent. Second one is a little bit more strategic, I think. If we look at hallmark for Chevron, it has always been on the LNG deepwater macro (00:23:47) project development. But I think the market is concerned, this type of development, there's a high-cost curve, has increasingly choose the last several years at the high end of the industry. And that also that the recent cost deflation that they have not seen as much comparing to the short cycle. So the question is that, do you agree with that view, and is concerned that the hallmark of the company what you're good at and of that to be at the high end of the supply cost curve? If you sort of agree with that, what initiative that Chevron is thinking to try to improve your cost curve position so that they will become, say, at the top quartile or top half at least.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah. That is a philosophical question, and I'll give you a few comments. First, I think it's true that onshore costs have come down more than offshore costs. So I think that's just factually true, particularly in the United States, but also around the world. So rig rates and service costs, things of that sort. So that certainly is true. It's also true that some short cycle base business spend traditionally has lowered cost, once you have infrastructure in place, and it, certainly, is true that some of the shales are low cost. I think what's important, though, is if you step back and look at the market overall, it's a 95 million barrel a day market. The shales are about 5 million barrels a day. And there's a decline curve that's very rapid in the shales, of course, in every other producing asset. And it's going to take contributions from all asset classes to meet demand. And so we're going to need all forms of supply, and what we're doing is trying to take on cost reductions and get better everywhere to take costs down. And we've been able to do that. We've shown you some charts periodically, and \u2013 I mean offshore is about 25% of worldwide production and Deepwater production continues to grow and will continue to make contributions to worldwide supply. But if you look at drilling and completions technology, we've talked about things like the single-trip multizone frac pack, which is just a more efficient to get in and out of the hole to do work. If you look at ocean-bottom nodes work that we're doing, that really gives us better seismic imaging on the ocean floor, subsea systems and boosting technology. All these things are bringing cost down. In fact, in our Gulf of Mexico operations, our Deepwater, we've been able to reduce drilling days significantly. Our drilling days for 10,000 feet are down 25% over the last two years. So we've been able to take those costs down. And I think you're also likely to see the work that we did in the Gulf of Mexico to consolidate holdings, to create \u2013 for the industry to collaborate to create hub class developments will also help with economies of scale. So I think you'll see bigger hubs, but I think all classes of assets, at the current low prices, will have some spending that will fall out. So it's \u2013 some of your points are true, but I think costs \u2013 you'll see costs over time come down everywhere, and, of course, these projects are over a long period of time. LNG are 40-year projects, so you have a different lifecycle to these things as well, which can impact \u2013 some long-cycle LNG tend to be \u2013 because they're long-cycle, tend to be a little bit lower than \u2013 in RORs, but they have a very long life and cash flow. So they have a little bit different characteristic to them.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Thank you.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Paul. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for all of the color. Just on the opening remarks, I think you said slower ramp-up on projects. So I presume that's going to be LNG, just looking at the cartoon which you put in the presentation in terms of LNG volumes. Maybe just a bit of a color around Gorgon and Wheatstone. Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: Well, we said that the ramp-up would take place over time. The key is getting them started and getting first LNG and then the ramp-up will take place over time. So, I think, all I was trying to say with the ramp-up is that they will take place over the next three years. My comment wasn't so much about the ramp-up as it was that there will be a start date. Just in terms of what we're expecting, I indicated that Gorgon will see first cargo in the first quarter. I had updates yesterday afternoon on both Gorgon and Wheatstone, and I was pleased with the progress that I heard. I gave you some of the kind of key points that \u2013 the kind of proof points to where we're headed there. ALNG will start up early next year as well. I mean there's no secret that this has been a challenge, as we work through some of the engineering issues, but once that gets started, I think we've addressed some of the engineering issues that we encountered. There were also some technical bulletins that were issued by the technology owner. We took care of those, as well, during this downtime. So ALNG will start up early next year as well, and my update on Wheatstone, the key issue there has been module delivery. We had some modules out of Malaysia that were late. The team is working very hard to mitigate schedule there, and what I mean by that is, with some delay in modules, we're really now looking at both construction timing and some of the start-up and commissioning work that will need to be done. We've taken a close look at all the other projects that have been done in Australia and elsewhere, on the East Coast of Australia and Gorgon, and really looking to see if we can take time \u2013 taking time out of those schedules by really taking all the best practices that were effective in those projects to keep us back on a fourth quarter 2016 start-up schedule. So the work is progressing well. The point in having a range on production is really that a quarter one way or another when you've got projects that go up to 200,000 barrels a day at full capacity makes a difference. And so it's just reflecting that reality. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Yeah, okay. Second question's on cash flow, maybe for Pat or John. So you can see this year you've done $17.2 billion before working capital so you could gross that up and say $23 billion. Obviously, you've got these new projects, so they'll add cash. And your cash CapEx is going down. So your overall group CapEx is going down to $20 billion to $24 billion. So you can see how the dividend is sustainable in sort of this year's condition. So that works fine. It's still a long way away from the cash flow that was presented a few years back at higher oil prices. So I guess my question is, is there anything this year in the cash generation of the company that you feel has underperformed? Because I guess the downstream has been pretty strong. Maybe it's start-up costs in some of these projects.\nJohn S. Watson: No. Actually, I think if you look at our cash flow, and the rule of thumb that we gave you for the effective oil prices was roughly $350 million after tax in earnings and cash flow for every dollar per barrel. And you multiply it by the change in barrel, I'd think you'd find that our cash flow is better than what you might expect by that rule of thumb. Now, we're trying to diminish that or reduce that rule of thumb by taking on costs and other things to get better at what we do, but I think you'd find that between those rules of thumb for oil and gas, I think you'd find that it's pretty consistent with that. And in fact, it's better because our downstream has performed so well. So I mean the grim reality is when you have on oil prices in the $40s, as we saw in the third quarter, as you look across the sector, particularly in the United States, it's tough sledding. And if you've got natural gas prices where they are in the U.S., it's a challenge. But we're taking it on by reducing costs. You saw some of the pretty aggressive actions that we're taking around the world to size the organization at the right level, and we think if we get some recovery in prices, you'll see a nice pop from that. But I can't control prices. I can only control my costs and spend. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) So it's just oil sensitivity. I understand. Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: Great. Thanks, Ed. Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nJason D. Gammel: Yes, thanks very much. Hi, everyone. You've already touched on a lot of drivers here, John. But I was just trying to reconcile the new production range of 2.9 to 3.0 relative to the 3.1 million barrels a day that was presented at the analyst meeting. And I wasn't really clear rather the Partitioned Zone was included in the 2.9 to 3.0 or rather it's out, because that's obviously a big reconciling factor. And then how much of it would essentially just be production being pushed into 2018 versus an actual lower production figure from declines?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, there are lots of effects that are in there. First off, the biggest effect in the change versus what we've talked about previously was my comment on declines. You can't take \u2013 depending on which numbers in the range you want to use, we've taken $15 billion of capital out of the business in the go-forward projections from 2016 and 2017 in total. And that impacts, as I said, base decline. So if you add 2% to the decline, that's 100,000 barrels a day over a couple of years. So that's number one. But to answer your question about the Partitioned Zone, that production a year ago was roughly 80,000 barrels a day. And if you look at where we expect it to be in 2017, it was somewhere under 70,000 barrels a day. And that is included in both estimates. We expect to be back online by that time. I just returned from the Middle East, and I'll tell you, this has been pretty perplexing to me why we remain shut-in. You have two great allies in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait who are having a disagreement over administrative matters in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It's in the Kuwaiti portion of the zone. And so, they administer work visas, equipment permits and things like that, and they stopped issuing them. And so we ended up shutting in May, and so we've lost the better part of 80,000 barrels a day net to our production. The reason I think production will come back is because the Kuwaitis themselves are actually being hurt by shutting in a gross amount of 200,000 barrels a day, half of which is theirs. They are hurt; Chevron is hurt, but Saudi Arabia is able to increase production elsewhere. So I think there's motivation for the Kuwaitis to begin issuing work permits and allowing work to continue while whatever disputes are resolved. And our plan is for that production to come back by 2017. In terms of other factors that are out there, we are high-grading some of the investment that we're doing in the shales, so while the growth profile will be nice, it'll be a little lower. Certainly, in the gas area, we've curtailed spending. We have really gotten our costs down very well in the Marcellus. We can compete with anybody there now. But nobody makes money, that I'm aware of, at $1.50 gas, which is where we are now. And futures prices remain low. So we can compete with anybody, but for the time being, we're scaling back investment there. So these are the kinds of effects that we've rolled in as well as schedule and timing of projects. A notable change from where we had been previously, of course, is Bigfoot, which we show no production in 2017 for.\nJason D. Gammel: Okay. That's obviously a big factor, then. Great. And John, just as a follow up. I think you kind of answered this in your response here, but if I'm looking at the capital spend slide in the analysts meeting, I was looking at $32 billion or so of capital spend in 2016 with some flexibility around that. Is the incremental flexibility that you've identified in the numbers you put forward today mostly coming out of that base investment, which is why you're seeing the higher decline curves?\nJohn S. Watson: It's a little bit of both. At $70, when we presented the information that we did to you earlier, that was with the expectation that we would be able to take costs out and that certain projects would continue. So we had funding in the out years. I mean, again, some of it was ultimately discretionary around certain projects. Some of that has been removed or deferred in some cases. And that's just reflecting the realities that we're seeing lower prices. So there's some in large projects, but there is also a good chunk of it that's coming in the base investment area.\nUnknown Speaker: Thanks, Jason.\nJason D. Gammel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Good morning, John.\nJohn S. Watson: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: John, I'm wondering how the \u2013 first of all, you've given a lot of information this morning. We really appreciate that, so thank you for all the disclosure. But when we get to 2017, let's assume your prognosis on oil prices or at least the supplied line balance is a little bit more optimistic. How does Chevron's sort of strategic go-forward view change in terms of, perhaps, reupping into another round of large scale projects of which you clearly have plenty of options versus being with the short cycle, I guess, flexibility until it sorts itself out? And what was really at the back of mind is I'm curious if you feel that you've got a big enough footprint to offer you that kind of flexibility. And I've got a quick follow-up, please.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, it's a very fair question. I commented a little bit earlier, as you know well, Doug. We went through this period with a number of projects stacked on top of one another. I don't think you'll ever see something like that in our \u2013 it was a series of circumstances that got us in that position. I don't think you're likely to see that. We do have a good queue of projects. I talked about the Anchor discovery which could mature into a project, and we've got others. So we'll take the best of those projects and move them forward. But I think on balance you'll see a higher proportion of shorter cycle spend. Five to seven years ago, we didn't really have a good understanding of our Permian basin position, for example. So you will see, over time, additional monies that will go to the shale developments. I mentioned that I had some reviews in my business units yesterday. I also had reviews with my four shale organizations, which are nicely sharing their successes. And the Permian is doing well. I mentioned the Marcellus is doing very well. The Duvernay in Canada, they've taken the practices and implemented them very quickly to get down the cost curve, and we're working closely with YPF and trying to put those same practice in place. We've delineated, we know where the sweet spots are down there. Now we're starting a horizontal drilling program, and we expect to get better. But I think you'll see a more balanced portfolio, and I think you'll see projects that will have good economics at moderate prices, as we work to standardize and take costs down. So we'll have some optionality in the portfolio. And I just \u2013 I can't envision having two big LNG projects at the same time. The Tengiz project is a significant capital project, but I don't see anything like having two Gorgon and Wheatstones plus several Deepwater developments stacked on top of one another.\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate the answer, John. My follow-up is, really, it's kind of on the head count reduction and the fact that you are now getting to the point where these major developments are coming onstream. Are there any portfolio consequences of having to amortize or rationalize a smaller head count across a much larger portfolio? And, of course, the tail changes when Gorgon and Wheatstone come on. So I'm just wondering if outside of the disposals you've given us so far, is there another round of portfolio restructuring that we should maybe look for at some point in Chevron's future? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, there are some changes that will happen in the portfolio. First, just a general comment on the people reductions. One of the large areas for reductions is in Australia. As we ramp down these projects, obviously, you need fewer people. That was known, and in most cases, we had \u2013 Australia has a provision for fixed-term employees, and so those \u2013 some of those people will be coming down off \u2013 will be coming off the payroll. We've got a significant reorganization that's taking place in Angola. And frankly, as we've gone through our business units and gone through our portfolio, we have found ways to make our organization simpler. I don't know any other way to say it. And so we'll be seeing reductions in a lot of different places. Some of them have already happened, in the Marcellus in the North Sea and in our home offices. So we've season those kinds of reductions. There is some portfolio work that I would \u2013 some of it I would classify as normal as assets mature. You saw the \u2013 for example, we sold our Netherland operations. Our view was that the Chad business was sort of on that \u2013 a lot of the value had already been extracted, so we sold out of that business. So there are assets that get mature where another operator \u2013 as you know well, there are smaller companies or others that want to grind out that last little bit of value that may take on opportunities that won't fit in our portfolio. And so sometimes there's a good match for them, and we'll sell those. Those can result in reduced employees, and I expect it will. But I would classify that as a normal part of our business. These reductions don't include any huge \u2013 the reductions that were forecasted don't include a major portion of the divestitures. The divestiture portion, at this point, is looked at as maybe 10% of that employee reduction, and I would classify it as more routine activity.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you, John.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks very much, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio: Hey. Good morning, everybody. We've covered a lot of ground today, so thank you. John, I know other than matching the cash flows, improving upon project execution is a key focus for you and Chevron. Positive advances in the quarter. Can you discuss the changes you have made here and your confidence that execution will improve as you move through this key execution phase?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, you're right. We are focused on that. You know, Jay Johnson went through some of those in a little bit of detail, and Jay, of course, is really good on projects. And I guess I would say there are a couple of things that I would highlight. I mentioned Angola LNG earlier, and that is symptomatic of something that's hit the industry, I think, overall, and that is engineering and engineering maturity. So we simply have to \u2013 in order to have better \u2013 a better understanding of what we're going to build, we have to advance engineering further. So understanding pipe diameter and things down to a more granular level so that we know what materials we're going to need and we can do better cost estimates is, I would say, number one. You know, the example we've given is the Tengiz project, which is a big one that we'll move forward with here. But that one \u2013 we're over \u2013 we're 35% done with the engineering now, and we'll be somewhere close to 50% by the time we take final investment decisions. So that's number one. But once you complete the engineering, you also have to do more reviews of that engineering, and, I would say, at a higher level, taking a look at constructability of facilities so that you don't \u2013 so that you're sure what you build really is what you want. I'll give you an example. One of the changes we're making in Angola LNG is designing more flexibility in the front end of the plant. It's an associated gas project, and so there's greater variability in feed quality. And I think if we had done more work at the front end, perhaps, we would have designed that with more flexibility in mind. So those are the kinds of things that we're going to need to do. We also have to be very cognizant of the contracting work that is \u2013 the kind of contract that you sign and what incentives are in that contract for the contractor. And that will dictate the level of oversight better. We're likely \u2013 for example, we're likely on the Tengiz project to do more in the way of coordinating the activity of subcontractors on that job, ourselves. So all of these things, I think, are going to make us better, not to mention the usual things around quality assurance that the industry have seen and things of that sort. So the answer is, yes, we're working on improving execution.\nEvan Calio: Great. And my second question Anchor, it looks like great appraisal results. Any comments on reservoir quality, size range or next appraisal steps, and maybe even somewhat related to Doug's question before. I mean, in a down cycle, do you see an advantage in developing these longer cycle assets where you can cement or secure a lower cost structure versus an onshore asset where you benefit faster on cost savings, but you will presumably reflate over time with a higher decline rate? Maybe how do you think about that?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah. We have to \u2013 we just finished the second well, and so we're going to drill \u2013 we're likely to have another appraisal well that we'll drill, but we're sort of assessing those results. It's likely to be a hub scale type development. You recall, we've said previously that hub scale assets are going to be 400 million to 500 million barrel type developments, and so we feel pretty good about this one. We've got more work to do, but we feel good. As far as doing them off-cycle, this one needs more work to do before we can progress it. So there's a cycle time to that. Costs, I don't want to give you the wrong impression, costs have come down. Deepwater rig rates, you can get deepwater rigs a lot less than previously. They have come down. I think the opportunity, if you talk to some of the equipment providers, they would say the industry can do a better job in standardizing to help them drive costs down. I think the tendency is to think we can continue to extract money out of the supply chain just based on working rates down, but we also have to work with them to help them become more efficient in what they do. And finally, some of the big cost reductions are in drilling efficiency, which I noted \u2013 which I noted earlier. So our view \u2013 just to be clear, our view is that hub class developments in that 400 million to 500 million barrel range can be developed at moderate prices that wouldn't be out of line with the kinds of prices you all are thinking about, and that tie-backs in the 100 million to 200 million barrel category can also be economic. But we're going through our plans right now doing exactly what you described in trying to decide which of these to move countercyclically and which are just going have to wait.\nEvan Calio: Makes sense. Thanks.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Evan. Thanks\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, everyone.\nJohn S. Watson: Hey, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: John, a year ago you were guiding to $40 billion of spending in 2017; now you're guiding to $20 billion to $24 billion. Can you break down what compromises that $15 billion? And just a very quick follow-up as well. Can you give us the start date for Tengiz? Thank you.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, but, you're saying a year ago. If you're saying before oil prices dropped, yeah, we were guiding to a higher level of spend because we've got a good queue of projects, and that would be the opportunity set that we would contemplate (50:27).\nPaul Sankey: Yeah, I guess what I wanted to know is what projects, how much of it is cost saving, how much of it is deferred projects? Which projects have been deferred? The specifics of where we got the $15 billion to $20 billion of savings from. Thank you.\nJohn S. Watson: Oh, it's across the board. I mean, there are some specific projects. An example, yeah, we've talked about the Rosebank project. We've talked about the Indonesia Deepwater development project. Both of those are not in these forecasts in terms of significant spend during the planned period. I think both projects will ultimately go. Kitimat was on our list. We're pacing that project as well. Multiple Angola projects were in pre-feed, so there were a lot of projects. Bear in mind, some of these projects we think will go, and it could be that they start in the third year of the plan. But for now, a lot of these have come out, and we're going to pace them.\nPaul Sankey: But I guesstimate that about half of it is cost savings from lower prices, and half is deferred projects. Is that an \u2013 I'm guesstimating. I just wonder.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, Paul. Look, I don't have a precise number for it. Certainly our view of development costs for the shales have come down significantly during that period, but I don't have a good breakdown for you on that. Sorry.\nPaul Sankey: Okay, and just the start-up for Tengiz?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, it's a function of when we take FID, but we'll give you more details on it. But you can think of it as being into the next decade.\nPaul Sankey: But just to be clear, I think that you said that the spending in the 2017 number does include some Tengiz spending?\nJohn S. Watson: It does. It does.\nPaul Sankey: Got it.\nJohn S. Watson: I mean, we've been doing work to get the port ready. We've been doing work on site infrastructure. I mean, one of the lessons learned on these big capital projects is that you need to take care of some of these certainly long leads in certain cases and site infrastructure and preparation work. So we're spending some money as part of the feed work that we're doing to get greater certainty on costs. But this is a five-plus year kind of construction project, so you can think of it as being into the next decade. And we'll give you more detail after we take FID.\nPaul Sankey: Thank you, sir.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure, thank you.\nUnknown Speaker: Thank, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question, please.\nBlake Fernandez: Folks, good morning. Just two quick points of clarity, if I could. For one, I presume that the CapEx numbers you're providing here include equity affiliate spend. I think historically that's trended around $4 billion and has been self-funding. I'm just trying to see if, for one, making sure that, that is in there, and is that a fair estimate in those numbers? And then, secondly, U.S. natural gas has been ramping up pretty healthy as far as production is concerned. John, you mentioned a low breakeven on Marcellus. I just wanted to confirm, is that the main driver of that? Thanks a bunch.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah. The answer is yes. It's $4 billion to $5 billion in equity and affiliate spend. Remember, as we ramp up the Tengiz project, we've got the CPChem project. We've got some significant spending that's taking place in affiliates. And your second question on Marcellus, we're not shutting down activity completely there. Don't get me wrong. But we're not going to be running six to eight rigs or anything like that in these kinds of conditions. Right now we've just a couple of rigs that are running there.\nBlake Fernandez: Okay. And John, if I could confirm this. Equity affiliates, that should remain self-funding, is that correct?\nJohn S. Watson: Not necessarily. I mean, in general the answer is yes. It's depending on where prices are. I mean, it depends on circumstances. Because as the Tengiz project ramps up, there is significant spend. And there are loan provisions that are being worked as a part of that project, some of which will be equity partners' loans.\nBlake Fernandez: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe if I could follow up a little bit on some of your commentary around the longer cycle project spend. The deferrals that we've seen, I mean, I guess it comes from a combination of things, which is either lower levels of operating cash flow as well as kind of an effort to drive down project costs and improve economics. As you think going forward of where you are right now, I mean, your effort to continue to defer at this point, is it driven primarily by this point by your outlook on cash flows, or do you think that there's still a meaningful amount of either cost deflation on the projects, or, I guess, strategic engineering improvements on your end that have to happen? If cash flow is sure to improve, do you feel like you're at a point where the industry will be able to start to re-invest in those, or is there still gains to be made?\nJohn S. Watson: It's a fair question. I would say a lot of it is cash flow driven right now. We're still in the final throes of our revisions to the Tengiz project cost estimates, but we have a pretty good idea where that's going to land. And we have a pretty good idea of the sort of the glide path on technology and where costs are going to go for deepwater projects. But there is some uncertainty on price, and, look, I know my shareholders value our dividend. I know our shareholders value increases in the dividend. And I know they value us investing in high-return projects, and so there is some uncertainty on price. And we want to be sure that \u2013 we've kept our balance sheet in good condition, and we want to be sure we just strike that right balance to continue to pay and grow the dividend and invest in good projects. So we're just working through the cycle and kind of living within our means while we take cost down. One of the things that happens if you're taking on fewer projects is the organization will focus harder on getting more efficient at what they do. And we need to do that. We've got a very good U.S. upstream business, but we didn't make any money in this quarter. And so, we need to get more efficient at what we do, we need to look at our structures and we need to get our costs down. And in the meantime, we're going to be ready for some of the projects that I talked about earlier to move them forward. We'll have some countercyclical investment, but we do need to live within our means.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. So then maybe if I could just get your quick thoughts on maybe on global gas demand, Asian gas demand, maybe even more in particular and whether probably less is a relation to Gorgon and Wheatstone, as those are contracted to a large extent. But has there been any shift in your view on global gas demand or Asian gas demand longer term? And how would that affect potentially your longer term view on incremental LNG projects going forward?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah. That's a fair question. I think overall, demand is set to grow very rapidly. And I think the conventional wisdom has been that you're just going to see natural gas displacing coal and gas demand just growing at very rapid rates. Gas has to be competitive with other options in the portfolio for these developing countries. Affordability is very much key, and so while we see literally a doubling of LNG consumption if you go out 10 years versus now, very significant growth in demand, I don't think that's changed. What has changed is the supply picture. We have seen a number of projects take FID and a number of projects are under construction, and the world economy isn't growing quite as fast as we might have thought a few years ago. It's still growing, but it isn't growing quite as rapidly as a few years ago. And so it's a well-supplied market right now. There still are contracting opportunities out there. Customers do value security of supply. They do value having a known source of supply. Not everybody wants to run their economy on spot gas. And so I think there are a number of buyers that want to firm up supply. For example, we signed a medium-term contract earlier this year, and we think there are other opportunities to do that. And as you see slowdown in FIDs on this, I think you'll see consuming countries take stock of that and start to think about additional commitments more toward \u2013 that would be more geared toward supply in the early to middle part of the next decade.\nRyan Todd: Thanks, John. I appreciate it.\nUnknown Speaker: Thanks, Ryan.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.\nRoger D. Read: Yeah, thank you, and good morning.\nUnknown Speaker: Good morning.\nRoger D. Read: I guess I'd like to kind of get a little more into some of the impacts of potential production declines from \u2013 that you've mentioned from the equity spending at Tengiz, but think about spending on non-operated projects that you're on or non-operating legacy production, and how that may impact the sort of revised production guidance we should think about, or even as a challenge in the 18 and beyond world.\nJohn S. Watson: I'm not \u2013 what \u2013 is there a special non-op question or concern?\nRoger D. Read: No, not a specific one, but let's just think about anywhere where you're not necessarily making the decision, right. You're dependent on someone else for that. How do you maybe take that into account in your forecast as a risk factor?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, certainly we're in dialogue with operators. For example, Total is operator in some of the West Africa projects that are potentially in the portfolio. We're an operator of some, and they're an operator of some. And so the dialogue has been pretty good. I would say the biggest area where we can get influenced, frankly, is in the Permian where we've got some smaller companies and they're very good at what they do, but their budgets can move around a little bit. But that's nothing that we can't deal with and accommodate. But I would \u2013 I don't think that's going to determine our flexibility in our capital budget.\nRoger D. Read: Well, I wasn't thinking so much of capital budget as I was just - you mentioned earlier the underlying production decline kind of being close to 1% in your outlook. You're thinking maybe more of the 2% to 3%, and I'm just kind of wondering what would push you to the 3% or potentially beyond the 3% being these things that are not necessarily in your full control.\nJohn S. Watson: Well, it's \u2013 I'm not going to push the 2% to \u2013 I'm not going to say the change of 1% to 3% is a function of non-op decisions, because I think everyone in the industry is doing similar things now. We've been reasonably well aligned on budgets with our partners, whether we're the operator talking to them or they're the operator talking to us.\nUnknown Speaker: Thanks, Roger.\nRoger D. Read: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next -\nJohn S. Watson: We've got time for one more.\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI Group.\nDoug Terreson: Good morning, everybody.\nJohn S. Watson: Good morning.\nUnknown Speaker: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: John, your new capital management plan appears to be one of the more direct steps towards better capital allocation outcomes that we've seen announced thus far in a super major category on these calls. And on this point, I wanted to see if you'd elaborate a little bit on the drivers of the proposed changes. Meaning, a few minutes ago, you talked about how the cyclical element, which is in response to lower oil prices and the need for cash flow to cover the dividend at some point was part it. But also, is there an element of the new plan which relates to the more challenging, competitive condition that appeared to have been a factor for the longer term industry returns in recent years? So the question's really, what's driving the more disciplined approach to investment at Chevron internally when you guys put this together? Meaning, is it cyclical, is it secular, is it both? Could you just spend a minute on that?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah. Truthfully, I would say that there's an element of all the things that you described. I think in general we were heading through a period where we had a disproportionate amount of our spend in big, long cycle projects. So we were going to head to a period where we were going to be digesting those projects and then we would supplement those with a more ratable number of long cycle projects, but then continue to invest in that new base of assets that we've acquired. And so I think that pattern is playing out. I think the issue is what can we do to enhance returns? We've said before, we took down our price deck a little bit from where we were before. And so there is a new reality in that sense, and whether that's due to industry supply conditions or the U.S. dollar or a lot of other factors that have taken commodities down, there is a new reality, if you will, in the commodity price environment for both oil and gas that we're seeing. The industry has been fabulously successful in providing supply. A lot of it is through shale, but also elsewhere. So our focus going forward directionally is consistent with what we would have done anyway. But we've taken spend down, as I commented earlier, to help us really focus on getting the most out of the assets that we have and taking costs down so that we can improve returns. It's unacceptable for us to not be able to make money at whatever commodity price the market is giving us. And that's where we are. Now, I do think commodity prices will improve, and I've said that, but we need to improve our returns. And so, I think that's the focus. And as I commented earlier, if you push the organization in that direction \u2013 I mean, we're already seeing \u2013 I mean, it's hard to put together a business plan right now because the organization is achieving good things in terms of getting our costs down, and it's hard to be forward-looking to know exactly where all the efficiencies might come from as the organization gets more focused on making the best of the assets that they have. So maybe that's the way I can describe it. So it's all of the above including taking costs out of bigger projects going forward.\nDoug Terreson: Thanks, John.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay, so. Well, thank you very much. I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in the company. Jonathan, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2015, "date": "2015-07-31 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President-Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two. Slide three provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $571 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments of $1.96 billion and other charges of approximately $670 million relating to project suspensions and adverse tax effects, all of which were non-cash charges stemming from a downward revision in the company's longer-term crude oil price outlook. Excluding these special items, as well as asset-sale gains and foreign-exchange effects, earnings were $1.8 billion, or $0.97 per diluted share, approximately $400 million higher than first quarter on that same basis. A detailed reconciliation of the special items is included in the appendix to this presentation. Cash from operations was $7.2 billion, an improvement of $4.9 billion from the prior quarter. Our debt ratio at quarter end was 17%. During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to shareholders of record as of August 19. We're currently yielding 4.6%. Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $7.2 billion during the second quarter and $9.5 billion year-to-date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than in the first quarter, the result of higher crude prices. We also benefited from strong cash generation from our downstream and chemicals business. Temporary working capital effects reduced year-to-date cash flow by approximately $2 billion. We expect this impact to reverse in future quarters. Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled approximately $3.9 billion, the vast majority of which related to our sale in the interest in Caltex, Australia. We are well ahead of pace on our four-year asset divestment program. In the past 18 months, we have recognized asset sale proceeds of nearly $11 billion, compared to our stated $15 billion goal over the 2014 to 2017 time period. Cash capital expenditures were $7.6 million for the quarter, essentially flat with the first quarter. Year-to-date cash capital expenditures were $15.2 billion, down $2.2 billion or 13% compared with the same period in 2014. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $12.2 billion and our net debt position was $19.4 billion. Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2015 earnings were $5.1 billion lower than second quarter 2014 results. Upstream earnings decreased to $7.5 billion between quarters. The impairments and other charges I noted previously accounted for $2.6 billion of this decline. Significantly lower crude realizations and the absence of second quarter 2014 asset sale gains make up the remaining variance between periods. Downstream results increased by $2.2 billion, primarily driven by higher worldwide margins and gains from asset sales, principally the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia. Operationally, the second quarter continued a positive quarterly pattern of high reliability, strong margins and good cost management. The variance in the other segment was primarily favorable corporate tax items. Turning now to slide six, I'll compare results for the second quarter 2015 with the first quarter of 2015. Second quarter earnings were $2 billion lower than first quarter results. Upstream earnings decreased by $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting the charges I previously discussed. Unfavorable foreign exchange effects and the absence of first quarter asset sale gains and the positive UK tax adjustment were also large variances between periods. Downstream earnings increased $1.5 billion as gains on asset sales were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange swing between the quarters. Operationally, the quarters were fairly comparable. The variance in the other segment was primarily favorable corporate tax items, partially offset by higher corporate charges, including severance accruals. Frank will now take us through the comparisons by segment.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide seven, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $578 million lower than the first quarter's results. Asset impairments and project suspensions across multiple assets, primarily as Pat indicated, from a reduced price outlook, decreased earnings by $630 million. Higher realizations, consistent with an increase in domestic crude prices, increased earnings by $190 million. Exploration expenses, mainly associated with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, decreased earnings by $70 million. The other bar reflects higher production, which was more than offset by higher DD&A rates. Turning to slide eight, international upstream earnings were $3.2 billion lower than last quarter's results. Asset impairments, primarily at Papa Terra in Brazil, project suspensions and adverse tax effects from price changes previously discussed reduced earnings by about $1.9 billion. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects decreased earnings between periods by approximately $670 million. The absence of last quarter's gains on asset sales and the deferred tax benefit from the UK tax change decreased earnings by $660 million. Increased exploration expenses resulted in lower earnings of $170 million. Higher realizations increased earnings by $395 million, consistent with the increase in Brent prices between the quarters. The other bar primarily consists of an unfavorable ruling on a decade-old tax issue and severance accruals booked in the second quarter. Slide nine summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 85,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital project ramp ups, primarily at Jack/St. Malo in the Gulf of Mexico and from the expansion of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh increased production by 22,000 barrels per day. Growth from our shale and tight assets, primarily in the Permian, contributed 11,000 barrels per day. As we foreshadowed in our first quarter earnings call, production in the Partitioned Zone was shut down at the end of May based on the inability to secure work and equipment permits. The shutdown decreased production in the second quarter by 38,000 barrels per day. We're still not producing in the Partitioned Zone, and we have no updated guidance as to when production is likely to restart. Planned and unplanned downtime reduced production by 34,000 barrels per day between periods, primarily in Canada and in Australia. Price and cost recovery effects decreased production by 23,000 barrels per day between quarters as high crude prices and reduced spending decreased volumes associated with production share and variable royalty contracts. The remaining variance in the base business and other bar primarily reflects natural field declines and weather-related production limitations at Tengiz. Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2014. Net production increased by 51,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 71,000 barrels per day due to production ramp-ups, primarily in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Bangladesh. Shale and tight production increased by 46,000 barrels per day due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, the Marcellus and the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina. Price and cost recovery effects increased production by 61,000 barrels per day due to the roughly 45% drop in crude prices between periods. The shutting of operations in the Partitioned Zone decreased production by 45,000 barrels per day. Asset sales resulted in lost production of 33,000 barrels per day, principally driven by the divestment of our assets in Chad and the Netherlands. The decrease of 49,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects normal field declines and the impact of higher external constraints, partially offset by a favorable variance from less planned turnaround activity. Our base business continues to perform well with a managed decline rate within our existing guidance range. Year-to-date net oil equivalent production was 2.638 million barrels per day and within our 0% to 3% guidance for 2015 growth. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, the third quarter is expected to be a comparatively heavy turnaround period, and we believe the full year production guidance remains appropriate. Turning to slide 11, U.S. downstream results increased $25 million between quarters. Tight product supply, primarily on the West Coast, boosted refining and marketing margins and increased earnings by $165 million between quarters. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $185 million, reflecting planned maintenance and turnaround activities at the El Segundo Refinery and commitments related to the Richmond Refinery modernization project. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects stronger results in our chemicals business. Turning to slide 12, international downstream earnings improved by $1.5 billion between quarters. Gains on asset sales, primarily related to the sale of the company's interest in Caltex Australia, increased earnings by $1.7 billion. Lower refining and marketing margins decreased earnings by $120 million between quarters as product price increases, including the negative price lag effects on naphtha and jet fuel failed to keep pace with rising crude costs. An unfavorable swing in the foreign currency effects lowered earnings by approximately $155 million. The variance in the other bar reflects multiple unrelated items. Jay will now provide an update on our upstream operations. Jay?\nJames William Johnson: Thanks, Frank. Turning to slide 13, I'm going to discuss our Upstream business, where we continue to make good progress in delivering the projects that are driving our growth in volume, in value and in cash. Gorgon is a critical part of that growth, and we continue to work towards the first LNG cargo. As you can see from the photo, plant construction has advanced. We're nearing mechanical completion of the first train with over 60% of critical subsystems handed over to commissioning. We've posted new pictures today and I encourage you to look at them on our investor website and chevron.com. Turning to slide 14, the upstream work scope for initial production from the Jansz field is largely complete with the control systems now active. We've established communications from the central control room on Barrow Island to the subsea wells, which enables us to conduct commissioning activity on the upstream and pipeline systems. Final testing is underway for the subsea infrastructure and controls. At the plant, all LNG and condensate tanks required for first LNG are ready and commissioning of completed process systems is underway. Currently the critical path is through the refrigerant compressors and the hydrate prevention system for the subsea wells. We expect to perform the first commissioning run of the compressors and testing of the hydrate prevention system in late September. Once we're satisfied with the operation of these systems we'll be ready to introduce gas from the Jansz wells into the upstream pipeline and begin the startup of Train 1, which we currently expect late this year. The schedule is dependent on managing commissioning and startup risks, including equipment malfunctions, possible labor and weather disruptions, as well as other unforeseen issues. Our focus is on a safe and incident-free startup that leads to reliable long-term operations. We're working to achieve the first LNG cargo by year-end. However, given these risks, it's likely to occur in early 2016. Now let's talk about Wheatstone, moving to slide 15. Wheatstone is now over 65% complete. On the upstream side of the project, we successfully completed the float-over and installation of the offshore platform in April. Hook up and commissioning is on plan with all subsea structures now installed. The flow line installation is underway and the development drilling program ongoing. All nine wells were previously drilled to the top of the reservoir and we're now drilling the reservoir sections of each well and running the completions. At the plant site, 11 of 24 major process modules for Train 1 have been delivered. All refrigeration compressors and gas turbine generators have been installed and the domestic gas pipeline has been completed. The focus of activity at the plant has shifted from civil works to mechanical, electrical and instrumentation systems. The work on site is going very well. Our biggest challenge has been the delays in module delivery from a fabrication yard, which is putting pressure on the schedule. To address the delays, we've expanded to an additional yard and provided increased oversight in the yards. We've seen positive results from these actions and are not anticipating any further delays in the module delivery schedule. Additionally, we've increased bed capacity at the plant site and are updating our work plans to mitigate the impact to schedule. Our objective remains first LNG by year-end 2016, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress over the next 18 months. Turning to slide 16. Performance at the Jack/St. Malo lower tertiary development continues to exceed our plan. The sixth well was brought online ahead of schedule and total production has ramped up to around 80,000 barrels per day. The development drilling program continues and we're seeing some get improvements in cycle time, costs, and stimulation effectiveness with the most recent completion 20% better on cost and schedule than previous wells. Work to install the Big Foot Tension Leg Platform was suspended in early June when nine of the 16 tendons lost buoyancy. There were no environmental impacts or injuries, and we are investigating the root cause of the incident. We have secured the site, including successful recovery of the seven remaining tendons. The tension leg platform was undamaged and is being moved to a safe harbor location. Site surveys and equipment inspections are in progress to determine whether the installed piles and recovered tendons can be reused and what equipment will require replacement in order to complete the project. At this point, we are not expecting any Big Foot production in 2016 or 2017, which is a reduction from our original plan of 10,000 net barrels per day in 2016 and 22,000 net barrels per day in 2017. As we complete the investigation and update our plan, we will advise you accordingly. Appraisal drilling is ongoing at the Anchor discovery and in the Northwest Keathley Canyon area, now named Tigris. Tigris has the potential to offer a multi-field, hub development of the Guadalupe, Gila and Tiber discoveries with the potential addition of the Gibson exploration prospect, which we plan to drill around the end of this year. Appraisal drilling is underway at Guadalupe and recent results from deepening the Gila discovery well are encouraging with further appraisal planned. We continue to progress our opportunity cue in the deepwater and in the second quarter made another lower tertiary discovery at the Sicily prospect in Keathley Canyon Block 814. We're encouraged by the results of the discovery well and follow-up appraisal work is planned. Turning to slide 17. As we communicated in March, our Permian position is strong. We have a large, high-quality acreage position with advantage royalty, which we are cost-effectively developing. We remain on track to drill 325 wells this year and have expanded to multiple factory mode, horizontal well development programs across the Midland and Delaware basins. We remain committed to our pace development approach, but the short cycle nature of these investments allows us to adjust this pace relatively quickly. In the current market, we've been active in negotiating cost reductions with our suppliers, achieving rate reductions of 20% to 50% across our major drilling and completion spend categories. At the same time, we continue to improve our drilling and completion efficiency. Since last year, we achieved roughly a 15% increase in drilling footage and a 20% increase in frac stages per day. The initial production rates for these wells are also very encouraging with our Bradford Ranch laterals averaging 1,100 barrels a day and comprising around 90% liquids. In addition, current estimated well recoveries have increased by 30%. So in summary, cost reductions, improved efficiency, and increased recoveries have improved our development cost per barrel by around 35% relative to 2014 and make more than 3,000 well prospects economic at $50 per barrel WTI. Let's move to slide 18. The major capital projects driving our growth are nearing completion, and are underpinned by our strong base business. The volumes associated with this growth are accretive to our cash margins and will contribute to long-term cash flow. We've reduced our current year capital spending by $5 billion relative to 2014. In the current environment, we are planning to reduce our 2016 and 2017 capital programs and our flexibility in capital spending significantly increases as our projects already in execution are completed. We are pacing projects not yet in execution to ensure we capture the cost advantages presented by the current environment and are prioritizing them to manage our capital program. We continue to drive cost reduction and efficiency to strengthen our cash flow by systematically reviewing our organizational structures and activity levels in our business units and by working with our suppliers. Pat will now conclude by sharing the enterprise impacts of these efforts.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. Turning to slide 19, I'd like to now provide an update on the self-help efforts that we have underway to lower our costs and improve our efficiency. To-date, we've identified more than $3 billion of spend reductions with about half coming through organizational reviews and half working through the supply chain. On the organizational side, efficiency reviews have recently concluded that covered our corporate gas and midstream and service company group. Similar reviews are occurring on a rolling basis within our upstream business units. Work activities in these identified groups have been prioritized, streamlined, and right-sized to the current environment. Savings totaled approximately $1.4 billion on a full run rate basis and represent both dollar and workforce reductions off the relevant base of about 20%. These benefits to our cost structure should become increasingly evident as we move through the next several quarters. In future periods, we expect to see additional savings identified as our remaining upstream units complete their reviews. We're also aggressively pursuing savings through the supply chain, particularly in the U.S., where our supplier responsiveness has been high. We have negotiated an excess of $1 billion in immediate savings, achieving product category reductions of typically 15% to 30%. We are also changing the way we work through greater standardization, project re-scoping, refinement of fit-for-purpose designs, and timing optimizations. In combination, we estimate negotiated savings and work changes will lower our future supply chain spend $1.6 billion. These savings will appear in multiple ways as we move through 2015 into 2016. Impacts will come in the form of lower operating expenses, lower capital and lower cost of goods sold. And we're not done. We expect more supply chain savings to be identified in future months, particularly as activity continues to flow and as additional spare capacity emerges. We are being aggressive in pursuing these self-help measures in response to a very challenging industry environment. Moving to slide 20, I'd like to close with a few thoughts. We made a commitment to our investors in March. We said we would cover the dividend from free cash flow in 2017. We stand by that commitment. We are taking the steps necessary to ensure we are a resilient competitor regardless of the ensuing price environment. Our focus areas are shown on the slide, get our capital projects currently under construction online, rebase and reprioritize our capital outflows, maintain reliability and drive our cost structure lower, and conclude our planned divestment program. If a lower price environment persists for longer, you'll see even more significant cost savings and even greater cuts in capital. As we showed you in March, we have tremendous flexibility in our 2017 C&E spend. We are confident that we can and are committed to scaling our C&E outflows in a manner that will allow us to continue our 27-year record of annual dividend payment increases. So that concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in. We're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up if necessary. And we'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. And once again, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please?\nJason D. Gammel: Yes. Thanks very much. First of all, if I could just ask on Gorgon. Jay, you mentioned the key risks still to getting to the first commercial cargo included labor risks, and there has been a lot of media attention to the \u2013 one of the unions that is employed by one of your primary contractors. Do you have any update on any industrial actions that could prevent getting that first commercial cargo in early 2016?\nJames William Johnson: Thanks for the question. At this point, the work with the contractors and the unions to agree a new contract is ongoing. The discussions continue. There was a fourth vote that was unsuccessful recently, and so the unions have requested and received permission to seek a strike vote, but there is warning time that has to occur before that happens. At this point in time, any action that would occur would be relatively short in duration, 24 hours or less, and we would have ample warning time before that would occur. But I think it's important to recognize that a strike at this point is really not going to be in anyone's benefit and so the negotiations continue between our contractors and the unions, and I'm optimistic that they will be able to find a solution and a way forward. I think the issues have largely been addressed. The primary one appears to be just around work schedules, and so that's an area that's receiving quite a bit of focus as we move forward.\nJason D. Gammel: Okay. Appreciate that. If I could, just as a follow up, ask a question about the charges that were recorded in the quarter for project suspension. Would you be able to give us any examples of projects that are being deferred and the level of CapEx savings that's being associated with these deferrals?\nJames William Johnson: We really aren't going to go into any specific projects that have been deferred, but as we look at our pre-FID capital, the projects that have not moved to sanction, we're really looking to do either deferments as we slow them down to take advantage of the current market environment, build lower cost structure into this projects. We're also looking to pace those projects as we build our capital programs looking ahead to 2016 and 2017. But some projects that we feel are not going to be competitive rather than keep them moving we've just elected to go ahead and suspend those and those costs reflect some of those projects that we've suspended.\nJason D. Gammel: Okay. Thanks for your thoughts, Jay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please?\nPhil M. Gresh: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nJames William Johnson: Good morning.\nPhil M. Gresh: First question, I appreciate the additional color on the operating cost reduction potential and if we think about the capital cost side, looking at your Analyst Day deck, you had a grey bar with respect to capital costs of about $20 billion in 2016, so I guess I'm just wondering like how much reduction potential is there from a deflation standpoint, a deferral standpoint, and really if you kind of wrap it all together with the operating costs, your guidance at the Analyst Day suggested that you could cover your dividend at $70. So how low do you think that could go given where we are in this current oil price environment?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: So I think there's two elements there. Let me just start with the last component here. Really, we did say we would cover our dividend from free cash flow at the $70 price. What I was trying to indicate in my earlier words is we intend to cover the dividend from free cash flow at whatever the ensuing price is. That is a firm commitment on the part of the company, and we have tremendous flexibility, really, in our 2017 C&E to flex that down. We are being very successful in driving our operating costs lower and working through the supply chain to accomplish not only operating expense but capital reductions as well. And that really is an affordability component for us. It's a cash flow management element for us, and after we get these projects that are currently under construction online, that flexibility in C&E becomes quite significant in 2017. So I'll let Jay talk to his prioritization process in terms of looking at the capital program in 2017.\nJames William Johnson: So as we're building \u2013 we're in the process of building our plan right now for 2016, 2017, and 2018. And as we go through, as we've said before, our primary focus first and foremost is on putting the investment back into our base business around asset integrity and maintaining good, reliable operations. And then we also fund the major capital projects that are in execution and as you have seen in our slides, that will decrease significantly as these projects come online. Just for example, in our LNG projects, this year we expect to spend around $8 billion in LNG, C&E, but by 2017, that's down to $1 billion. So we'll see tremendous flexibility coming in just from that. At the same time, we're looking at our base business, and as I mentioned, we are bringing our costs down, our efficiencies up, so we're seeing very good performance out of our base business and able to compete even in this environment. So we're evaluating how much money to put back into the base to maintain and continue to grow, particularly the short cycle, high value returns. And then finally, we're looking at the projects that are pre-FID, and as I said, we want to build in the lower cost structures, and we want to be able to preserve the option so that as prices recover, we can decide at what pace and how to ratably bring these projects back into the program. Moving engineering forward so that we have better definition, better understanding of these projects is a very low-cost way to build more confidence into our program for the future. And the last area is our exploration. We've been very successful in the last several years, so we've built up a bit of an inventory on the resource side, and so we can pull back on exploration over the next couple of years as we consolidate and wait for prices to recover. So I would see a dramatic and significant reduction in capital as we move forward. We're building that into our plans but the exact amount is yet to be determined.\nPhil M. Gresh: Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question in just in light of the commentary about Big Foot, some of the risks around Gorgon and Wheatstone, maybe you could just discuss your degree of confidence with the 3.1 million barrels a day production target for 2017 at this point, and to what degree you might be able to quantify what you see as the downside risk, because I know there was some cushion in that at one point, but maybe just kind of update us with your latest thoughts on that? Thanks.\nJames William Johnson: We still feel very confident about the growth we're going to deliver, and that's primarily because the growth is captured and driven by these major capital projects that are currently in execution. And as I said, we'll continue to fund those and bring those to completion. So that growth is there, it's real, and it's based on our underlying base business performance, which has been very strong, and we've done a good job of being able to maintain our underlying decline rates. But we're in a different world, and so we're seeing costs change, obviously as the cost \u2013 or prices structures have come down, costs are moving, and so just as we did with North American gas, there's still opportunity to make adjustments in how we continue to invest in some of the shorter cycle opportunities. So I see us as having a very strong base. The growth, we're very confident with that. The level of the divestment, the level of base business, those can be some factors that go into it, but on balance, we are very strong on the growth prospect and the growth story that we presented to you.\nPhil M. Gresh: Okay. Thanks.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please?\nEdward Westlake: Yes. Good morning. So maybe a small question to begin with. Just obviously Big Foot delay and then you're talking about extra fab space for Wheatstone and extra beds, I presume that the CapEx impact that you might be able to speak to or not and then obviously would you be able to offset that with the cost reduction efforts that the industry is going through?\nJames William Johnson: Thanks. That's a good question. With Wheatstone, when you put extra beds in, there are some costs associated with that. At the same time, because the modules were delayed, we didn't build up the manpower initially as we had originally planned, so there were some savings early on. But in general, we're facing cost pressure on the projects just as we are around the world. At the same time, we're seeing very favorable exchange rates in Australia that are a countervailing force to that. So we're still working under the cost forecast that we've already provided to you. We'll continue to monitor that and see how we progress through the next 18 months, and we'll update you if we feel costs have changed significantly.\nEdward Westlake: Right. And then this is a broader question. There was a period where Chevron had very good project execution, and then there have been, obviously, some well publicized setbacks more recently. If there was one change or one message that you were trying to get to investors and to the organization about how to hold on to better project execution, what would that message be, and is there any anecdotes or data to illustrate that that is changing?\nJames William Johnson: That's also a good question. I think what we have seen, some degradation in terms of performance, and it's driven by a couple of things. One, the projects have been very large and complex. In and of itself, that's not just something that should be difficult to manage, but because of the number of projects being simultaneously managed I think both the industry's resources were stretched thin as well as our own resources to manage these projects was stretched thin. As we now consolidate and finish this big wave of projects that drives the growth that we have, roughly 20% from 2014 to 2017, we won't see that kind of sustained effort to maintain that growth going forward. It'll be at a much more moderate pace. So I think we'll have the more ratable queue of projects back into the range that's more straightforward to manage. At the same time, we're also working to lower the cost structures and increase the predictability of these projects by advancing engineering before we move them to FID. So as I mentioned on many of our pre-FID projects such as FGP, we talked in March about advancing the engineering past 50%, that 40% to 50% range by the time we take FID. Just as an example, you're looking for a proof point, when we took Gorgon to FID, we had modeled 12-inch pipe and larger in our 3D CAD models at the time of FID. FGP will have 3-inch and larger pipe in our system and sketches done for everything below that. So there's a great deal more definition in the design before we're moving these projects forward. So I think the combination of having a more ratable program along with better engineering, more advanced, higher-quality engineering will pay dividends for us.\nEdward Westlake: Thanks, Jay.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question, please?\nPaul Y. Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Jay, if I could, two questions. If you're looking at a company the scope and size of Chevron on a going-forward basis \u2013 historically that you spend most of your capital in the long cycle macro development, how is that going to change, and is there \u2013 may be a sweet spot how that's going to shift between the short cycle and long cycle development effort going forward?\nJames William Johnson: Yes. I think as you look at projects like the Wheatstones, the Gorgons, the FGPs and TCO, these are projects that will add very large base and very long term assets to our portfolio. As we execute our small capital projects, which are often infill drilling programs, work-over programs and de-bottlenecking, we typically see rates of return above 50%, and they're built on these assets, we've already made the investments. So I think we're really doing a good job of rejuvenating our base and putting some new life into the base that we can continue to exploit over a long period of time, but at the same time we're building our capability day by day in our ability to go after the shale and tight largely in North America and in Argentina. So as you've seen our performance numbers continue to increase, we're coming down that learning curve and we're becoming more and more competitive, and it's going to give us a very good balance between deepwater projects, large base projects in the LNG and sour gas as well as access to the shorter cycle of shale and tight unconventional projects. So I see a very good balance and a very good diverse portfolio (39:21).\nPaul Y. Cheng: Is there a percentage that you can share that on the going forward basis there was that capital spend between the long and the short cycle going to look like?\nJames William Johnson: At this point in time, I don't have a ratio or a percentage to share with you. Our resource base has increased about 15%. Our portfolio has increased in the unconventional side by about 15% over the last five years in particular. So we're seeing more of our resource base being the unconventionals but the unconventionals have very high, very fast decline rates, and that is always going to be something we balance against the longer-term projects with their stable production. So that's something we'll work through as we react to market conditions, our view of forward pricing and the capital that we want to invest across the portfolio.\nPaul Y. Cheng: The second question is that, Jay, going back to your early comment, not just Chevron, it looked like the whole industry the last maybe 10 years has got openly optimistic about their capability to deliver and execute. And so, it seems like everyone is stretching themselves to the limit and we start seeing all these execution issues. For Chevron, learning from the mistake of the last several years, have you changed the way \u2013 I mean you are talking a little bit about more definition. But at the top how have you changed the investment decision process on the FID? Will you be \u2013 I mean in the future \u2013 in the past the industry tends to just looking at the financial capability and whether that you can afford the project and whether it is a good project. How that is going to change in the future particularly for Chevron ?\nJames William Johnson: For Chevron, we have traditionally looked at individual products and the economic opportunity each project presents in making an investment decision. I would say now in the current environment and looking forward, there'll be two additional lenses that will be added to that decision. First and foremost, the project and the economic proposition it presents, but then we'll be looking at what is the overall level of investment we want to be making and also what is the level of human capacity we have to manage the projects? And those will certainly be factors that we will build into the process, and we are building into the process now so that we can keep that as we move forward. We've also done a lot of work to put in what we call readiness reviews, and these are to make sure that both from a design and a design assurance standpoint before the project moves to execution but also before we start up these projects, we're going to readiness review that are much more rigorous and help us make sure we have the resources and the capabilities in place to execute these projects as expected.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Thank you.\nJames William Johnson: Thanks.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please?\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Maybe if I could do one follow-up on the costs, on the slide you have there, on slide 19, there is the $3 billion and spend reduction targeted. I'm not sure if I miss it when you said it, but is this all, is the CapEx and OpEx, is that all in the OpEx side? Can you estimate how much you've captured to date, how far along you are at this point?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so the combination of the $3 billion is for both operating expense and capital. The $1.4 billion is predominantly going to be operating expense, and the $1.6 billion is going to be a mixture of both and probably leaning a little bit more towards the capital side of things. And from a \u2013 and these are elements that should begin to show in an accelerated basis as we move through the third and the fourth quarter. I would say captured to-date actually has been some but not a high proportion of the $3 billion total.\nRyan Todd: Okay. And is there a timing on when you hope that this \u2013 something you hope to capture over the next year or two years or...?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Oh, I think it will be more immediate than that. I mean think it will be into the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2015 with some carryover into 2016 as well. I mean, a large portion of the supplier engagement element there, a billion dollars of that are negotiated price reductions off of planned 2015 activity. So those negotiations began, as you know, back in the January, February timeframe, we're sort of concluded in the May, June timeframe and so those rate reductions we should begin to see coming forward in the next half of the year.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thank you. Very helpful. And then maybe if, I appreciate the color that you gave earlier on Big Foot and the contribution of Big Foot to the 2016 and 2017 plans. Could you maybe give the same numbers for what \u2013 in the 2017 plan, let's assume for the Partitioned Zone, and Angola LNG and maybe any updates you have on both of those projects?\nJames William Johnson: Sure. And first I'll start with the PZ. The PZ, at this point in time, we have around 60,000 barrels a day to 70,000 barrels a day expected in the 2017 plan but we do not expect that field to still be shut in, in 2017. So my expectation is that we will be able to resume operations. There is an issue that's being discussed between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The impact on us is the difficulty receiving visas and equipment permits. So we were unable to continue operations and we stopped operations there as this issue is addressed. Our goal would be to return to normal operations in the short term as the \u2013 any other issues are continued to be worked out between the two governments. And so we work and we're trying to support the activities in that area accordingly. In terms of the ALNG, progress is moving along quite well there. We are completing the work on all the piping modifications, you recall this is as a result of the acoustic-induced vibration analysis that was done, so that work should be finishing up in the month of August, and then that will allow us to start the recommissioning process at the plant. The other work, in terms of the conditioning equipment on the front end of the plant to handle the diversity of the associated gas feeding the plant will be complete as are the technical bulletins. But we would expect to see restart late the year and then sustain production in 2016 and onward. So that's really the status of those two projects.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thank you very much. I'll leave it.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Ryan.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please?\nNeil S. Mehta: Good morning.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nJames William Johnson: Hi, Neil.\nNeil S. Mehta: So, Pat, I just want to talk philosophically about how you're thinking about the dividend and your strategy there. Didn't raise the dividend in the third quarter, but the way we read the comments was that we'd look for you to raise it here in the fourth quarter even if it's a nominal level, and it's a priority to continue to raise the dividend going forward. I just wanted to confirm that and then get your thoughts on the broader dividend strategy.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: A good question. So our broader dividend strategy hasn't changed. Our financial priorities haven't changed. Maintaining a competitive and growing dividend is our absolutely number one objective. What has changed, though, is obviously our immediate financial environment, and so the board chose not to raise the dividend in this quarter. I think that's a prudent action at this point because we're not running as strongly, certainly, as we would like on both earnings and cash flow because of where commodity prices sit. And it's not \u2013 I would say it's probably we're not in a very stable either revenue or cost environment. We have a lot of fluidity on those two components here. I will say the board is very committed to growing the dividend and seeing our pattern of dividend increases every year materialize, but what's important here is that it's the annual dividend payment that has moved up every year. That doesn't mean you get an increase in the per share every single year, because we typically have moved them in the second quarter. So it's an annual dividend payment history that applies to the 27-year factor. So I think the board is committed to that. We are committed to that. So I would like to be able to say our entire objective is being able to grow the dividend when the time is appropriate. We don't want to get out over our skis. We want to do it in a manner and at a time when we can see that we can hold on to that increase, sort of in perpetuity. We don't want to put ourselves into a position where we're pushing things, where we are having to fund the dividend off the balance sheet for an extended period of time, so we'll do it as soon as the financials really allow us to get there. It is our number one priority, though.\nNeil S. Mehta: Thank you, Pat. And, Jay, a question for you around Latin America. Two regions in particular. Venezuela output generally seems to be very robust across the country. Curious what you're seeing there and if you can comment on your relationship with \u2013 just politically over there, and given some of the potential tensions? And then the outlook for Argentina as well, it looks like a very powerful resource, obviously a dynamic political situation there as well, but comments on both of those plays would be terrific.\nJames William Johnson: The performance in both of those areas has been good, and our relationships with the government in both countries I'd characterize as very strong. We have a long history and we have worked hard to maintain both our performance and our relationships. In terms of the unconventional play in Loma Campana, we are seeing continued progress there. We have linked in that asset team, and they are tied to our North America asset teams, so there's good sharing of the information as we continue to move down the learning curve, as we gain knowledge from the industry and offset partners, we're plowing those back into the business, moving to consistent sets of metrics. So that drive to continue to improve in the unconventional space is being applied in Argentina as well. And so we're quite excited about that potential for that asset.\nNeil S. Mehta: Thank you, Jay. Thank you, Pat.\nFrank Mount: Thanks Neil.\nJames William Johnson: Thank you.\nNeil S. Mehta: Thanks, Frank.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?\nEvan Calio: Good morning, everybody. I think you mentioned earlier the inability to slow offshore exploration spending in this current environment or in your outlook here. But can you quantify exploration spending in 2015 and 2016 from at least from an Analyst Day timeframe and discuss rate commitments that limit your flexibility into that timeframe.\nJames William Johnson: Yeah, the Deepwater drilling that's going on in the Gulf of Mexico, of course, we have six rigs there, and it moves back and forth between exploration and appraisal. So as we have exploration success, than rigs get taken out of exploration and moved into more appraisal and development work. So for example, right now, we have, of the six rigs, four are working on production and development wells and two are working on appraisal wells, and we'll move some of those back into the exploration area. We currently expect to drill about 12, what we consider to be high-impact exploration wells around the world this year. We continue to see activity in West Africa, Deepwater West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico are two of our primary areas but we also have some other work in the unconventional going on as well.\nEvan Calio: Right. So it's more of a shifting then maybe a reduction on the rig side.\nJames William Johnson: I think as we move forward, we're going to, on the rig side, we shift those back and forth. Of course, they're under long-term contracts, the large Deepwater rigs. But in terms of some of the unconventional work, those rigs are on shorter cycle, and we can move accordingly with our capital allocation.\nEvan Calio: Great.\nJames William Johnson: Going forward, my comment was really around how much additional work we're going to put in outside of those committed Deepwater rigs.\nEvan Calio: Great, Jay. And since I have you while you're on the call, maybe a question on the Permian. Your EUR's are up 30% on the slides. Any color on the driver there, whether it's completion, lateral lengths, different zones? And maybe just generally within your portfolio, given the returns, I mean is this region a net receiver of more capital versus other areas where there may be more capital pressure in this environment?\nJames William Johnson: Yeah, on the first question, I would say it's all of the above. As we're getting more effective in our drilling, we're learning a lot from our offset operators and we're moving, as you know, from vertical wells to horizontal wells, and our preference is to really be able to drill those 7,500 foot laterals. The IP rates are consistent with what we were hoping for. We're seeing high liquids content in Bradford Ranch. So everything's looking pretty positive there and when you combine that with the reductions we're getting from our cost of suppliers and the efficiencies, that's what's driving that 35% reduction and our development costs per barrel. I would say that as we look forward, we certainly see the Permian as a very lucrative area for us to continue to grow, but because so much of that acreage is held by fee, we have the luxury of being able to moderate and decide just how much we want to put in there and really can use that as a flywheel. As we put more infrastructure into the area, it really gives us increasing flexibility and profitability as we move forward.\nEvan Calio: Great. Thanks for your answers.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Evan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.\nDoug Terreson: Good morning, everybody.\nJames William Johnson: Good morning.\nDoug Terreson: On the industry deflation theme, I wanted to see if Jay could comment on whether \u2013 Jay, whether you think the pace of cost capture that Chevron's experiencing is different between the U.S. and overseas markets, meaning is one of them lagging the other? And also, do you think it's reasonable to believe that the pace of cost productivity captured for larger companies like Chevron might lag that of smaller companies during this part of the cycle?\nJames William Johnson: Good questions. I'll talk first about the U.S. versus International.\nDoug Terreson: Okay.\nJames William Johnson: We have seen a faster response in cost reductions in the U.S. than in the international side. A lot of that's driven by the competitiveness of the U.S. market. There are more contractors out there, there are more service providers, and you can work and make transition from one to another faster if needed. As you get into the international environment, it varies country by country, but the barriers to entry can be much higher. There's often local content issues. Many of these companies may be in joint venture with local companies. So it just makes it more difficult sometimes to drive those costs lower in the short term. But what is happening is we're seeing the activity levels come off substantially, and as activity levels come off, we're seeing that drive the cost structure lower. So I think we will see, and particularly as low prices persist, we will see the international continue to come down. It just hasn't been at the rate that we've seen in North America. I'm sorry, the second part of the question?\nDoug Terreson: Yeah. And also, Jay, do think it's reasonable that larger \u2013 that the cost productivity capture for big companies like Chevron might lag that of the smaller companies during this part of the cycle?\nJames William Johnson: Yeah. I think in North America the small companies can also drive costs down just as we do, because as I said, there's enough competition for provision of goods and services that they can make those switches just as we can. And so they can drive very, very rapid reductions in price. In the international area, what we're trying to do is really work as an enterprise so that we are working with our major suppliers and coordinating our efforts to drive those costs down around the globe. That's why I think a big company has some leverage that a small company wouldn't. We can work with these very large companies to drive those efficiencies, to make sure that our global contracts and terms and conditions support a lower cost structure.\nDoug Terreson: Okay.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: And I'd just add that I think because of our spend and our size, that gives us additional leverage that some of the smaller firms don't have.\nDoug Terreson: It seems like it would over some period. And then also, Jay, you talked about the neutral zone a few minutes ago and it's obviously been shut in for a few quarters. And I know it's hard to know whether the Saudis and the Kuwaitis are close to resolving their issues, but my question is if those fields were able to be brought back on stream, over what period of time do you think this could happen? Meaning is this something that could occur over months or is it quarters or is it a longer term period, given the extended nature of the shut in? So how do you think about that?\nJames William Johnson: Well, the fields were shut in \u2013 the Wafra field was shut in, in mid-May. So that kind of gives the beginning of the timeframe. And obviously it depends on how long they remain shut in. If we were able to restart in the next couple of months, I think we'd be looking at probably like about a six-month ramp-up to get back into kind of normal operation. Obviously visas have to be issued, we have to get workers into the country, we have to get the facilities restarted. So we've been doing steadily since the facilities were shut in, preservation work to make sure that the facilities are protected and that we are ready for a restart. There's extensive planning around the restart. So I think as we work to get approval to restart that field it really just depends on how long it's going to take before that restart initiates. But at this point in time, we can restart in a relatively short period of time. Couple of quarters I would say.\nDoug Terreson: Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Doug. Yup.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please?\nPaul B. Sankey: Hi, everyone.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nPaul B. Sankey: Hey. A follow-up just from earlier comments, and then I have a separate question. I wasn't quite clear what you're saying about the dividend. Did you say that the 27-year record is not of increases in per-share dividends but is an absolute payout? I think that's what...?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: It's an annual payment record, yes.\nPaul B. Sankey: So we're looking at the dollars that you pay out as an amount? Is that \u2013 that's the increase...\nPatricia E. Yarrington: That's correct.\nPaul B. Sankey: Okay.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: That's correct.\nPaul B. Sankey: Okay. So what you're saying is it may not increase on a per-share basis?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Each year it may not. But the payment in each year has increased 27 years.\nPaul B. Sankey: Yeah, given all the moving parts here, if we could just \u2013 I'm sorry if I missed it, but are we still reiterating the $3.1 million a day for 2017, and is that changing with the asset sale element here? I'm not clear if you've increased your asset sale target. And I think your net asset sales from the $3.1 million a day, is that correct? And furthermore, is the cash flow neutrality target dependent on asset sales? And I'm again not clear if you've increased the asset sales. And finally, is the cash flow neutrality a number at which you keep volumes flat or you grow? Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so let me just go back and talk about the original objectives that we put out in 2017 and $70 oil and the cash flow neutrality. That \u2013 the assumption that we had in there was independent of asset sales, at the $70 price. Now depending upon where you go on price, I have indicated that we would continue to work our cost structure. We would continue to work our capital outlays. I think we also need to keep asset sales in the portfolio. It is an arrow in the quiver. It is a lever that we would have. And what we showed you back in March, we were cash flow neutral covering the dividend without asset sales in there. Depending upon where prices end, obviously I think that's a lever that we still need to have in the \u2013 available to us.\nJames William Johnson: So when we gave you the SAM information in March, we had about 65,000 decrease from the 2014 to 2017 in asset sales. And that, as Pat said, can certainly change as we determine what the level of asset sales is going to be. But the $3.1 million is really driven by the major capital projects that are under construction that are going to be coming online. I think one of the key points was, as we also said in March, those volumes that are contributed are accretive from a cash margin standpoint. So as those projects come online, we still see that as the main driver of our growth, and then we just have to evaluate both from a divestment standpoint and any moderation in capital into the base, what the impacts of that might be.\nPaul B. Sankey: Okay. So we're sticking with the $3.1 million. It's not necessarily contingent. You're not adjusting for asset sales but neither are you adjusting for the project issues that you talked about in the call. The cash flow neutrality doesn't or does include asset sales and can you grow from there in 2017 if you are cash flow neutral? Thanks.\nJames William Johnson: Yeah, I think from the standpoint that the $3.1 million is an outcome. It was $3.3 million, and as the North America gas pricing came substantially lower and we saw it staying lower, we pulled back some investment from North America gas and brought our target down accordingly. At this point, we're still at $3.1 million, we still have all these projects that are under construction and driving forward, but obviously, we just have to see if this very low price condition persists. It may have some impact. The $3.1 million is good a number as an outcome that I can drive it to at this point in time. In terms of going forward, we'll actually see our capital programs. We've talked about moderate quite a bit because we're not going to be trying to do the \u2013 and accomplish the organic growth that we're underway right now. So as we look forward, we're evaluating that now, we'll see some momentum continue. Projects like Gorgon have two trains that will come on, Trains two and Trains three and then the ramp ups that are associated with those Trains. Wheatstone will have a second Train coming on. We'll have some other projects that are still in the ramp up phase. So I see some momentum carrying past 2017. Those are also going to be strong volumes from a cash margin standpoint. And then as we look out into the next decade, a lot of that is going to depend on the options that we've been able to preserve and the degree to which we've moved to any of the pre-FID projects forward. That's part of the work that's undergoing now in our business plan.\nPaul B. Sankey: Okay. So I don't want to go on too much with it. But just a final specific, one with the cash neutrality does include asset sales.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: So in the $70 case, the answer was no, it did not. Depending upon what case you're going forward with here, a $60 case, a $50 case, whatever your case is, I want to preserve that degree of flexibility for us. Our primary levers are going to be getting our cost structure down and getting our capital program down for whatever price environment prevails out there. But depending upon where prices do go, I don't want to take off our available set of options. I don't want to take asset sales off that available set of options.\nPaul B. Sankey: Okay. I understand. Can I slip in another one? Why was the...?\nFrank Mount: You see, Paul, we're overtime. We got a couple of guys (01:03:43).\nPaul B. Sankey: Yeah. I'll let you go. Thank you.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question, please?\nAlastair R. Syme: Hi, everyone. Can I just ask on the impairment exactly what it was that triggered it? Is it just oil price or is it something about assets going up for sale or some geological review?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so...\nAlastair R. Syme: And can you can say what oil price it is?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I can answer most of those questions here. The trigger really was a lowering of our corporate longer-term price outlook on crude oil. We took that action in May, and as you know, when there's a trigger event like that, we do need to run impairment tests on our assets. Any time there's a significant trigger, whether it be a reduced price outlook or increased costs or some change in the geology in the reserve or production profile, those are elements that when that trigger occurs we need to do the impairment reviews. And we have a process set up where we look at that every quarter. In this particular instance, the vast majority of the impairments related to Papa Terra, and that was a price-induced, crude oil price-induced impairment. We did have a couple of other smaller assets in this category as well where they were assets held for sale where we were writing it down basically to what we felt was the realizable value.\nAlastair R. Syme: And on the oil price? Is it possible to talk around that?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. We're not going to give you our proprietary oil price. I can just say the revised outlook was really based on two factors. One had to do with the rate we were expecting of global GDP growth and in particular around China, so we've seen softening in China, and we've taken our view of that down accordingly. And the second major factor that lowered our overall price outlook had to do with the U.S. tight oil shale produceability. We've seen obviously much stronger production coming out of the U.S. and with the ingenuity and cost efficiency of the U.S. industry we've seen costs continue to fall, and economics of those barrels continue to rise, and so that puts more supply onto the market place. And so it's those two factors that's led us to lowering our longer term price outlook.\nAlastair R. Syme: Right. And finally, is really anything taken on Big Foot other than the impairment or in the suspension, project suspension (01:06:07)?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: No. Nothing of any material size, no.\nAlastair R. Syme: Okay. Thank you very much.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Alastair.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you, and, guys, thanks for letting the call run over. I really appreciate you letting that. I just want to get on with the end here. I guess I wanted to kind of follow up on a couple of things that Paul mentioned. I really had two specifics. But $11 billion out of $15 billion on disposals, what is your thought on raising disposal target at this point given that you've still got two and a half years left in the program? It would seem you've got a lot of upside potentials. So that's my first.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. And we're not in a position to move that target at this point. We just moved that target back in March. We feel very good about the assets that we've been able to move forward and the value that we have captured for that. So we have a number of assets kind of lined up in our own mind about how we could meet that $15 billion target over the next several months, 18 months or so. But it really will depend on whether or not that value is capturable. And we're not going to just sell the asset for the sake of meeting a target. We want to capture value while we do it. So I'm not in a position to raise that target at this point. We feel good about where we sit. When we get to March of next year, if we have a different view, we'll update it at that time.\nDoug Leggate: Appreciate it. My follow up, and I guess last question of the call is on Gorgon, not so much on the timing of the startup, I think Jay's been pretty clear on that, but the timing of getting to full capacity because obviously the cash flow delta that comes from the slowdown in spending versus the cash flow contribution is quite important. And I guess what I am getting at is if everyone is really starting to think lower for longer, what does the cash contribution look like and how long does it take to get to full capacity? So, I don't know how you want to try and answer that, but if you could help us with the contribution from Gorgon when it does come on, that would be \u2013 Gorgon (01:08:18) that would be very helpful.\nJames William Johnson: So our current view on Gorgon is that each Train, the second Train should start up about seven months after the first Train and then followed by four to six months for the third Train. And it should take around eight months on the first Train to get to capacity is our plan, and then six months for Trains 2 and Trains 3. So you can kind of put all that together to get a rough profile of what Gorgon's going to look like coming forward. And even in the lower price environment the cash generation that it has is still substantial, so we're looking forward to getting that cash on stream.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. I think that was our last call. I want to thank everybody for your time and attention here this morning, and I'll turn it back to you, Jonathan.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2015, "date": "2015-05-01 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington, please go ahead.\nPat Yarrington: Okay, thank you Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jeff Gustavson and Frank Mount who are currently transitioning the General Manager of Investor Relations role. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The Company's first quarter earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.37 per diluted share. Excluding gains from asset sales, foreign exchange effects and other special items, earnings were $0.76 per diluted share or $1.4 billion. This is a better outcome than the decline in commodity prices would have implied. This is because operationally, it was a very solid quarter for both upstream and downstream. Production volumes were strong and downstream asset utilization and reliability were high, plus operating cost control was evident throughout the enterprise. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was approximately 10% and our debt ratio at quarter end was 18%. During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividend. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to shareholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield about 3.8%. Turning to slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $2.3 billion for the first quarter. This reflected lower upstream results due to the sharp decline in commodity prices as well as negative working capital effects of approximately $2 billion. The majority of the working capital effects are temporary in nature and we expect these to reserve in future quarters. These impacts were only partially offset by strong cash generation from our downstream and chemicals businesses. In the quarter, proceeds from asset sales totaled approximately $950 million, the majority of which related to the sale of our interest in multiple offshore and onshore leases in Nigeria. In February, the Company successfully executed a $6 billion bond offering. Cash capital expenditures were $7.6 billion for the quarter, a decrease of approximately 11% from first quarter 2014 and over 20% lower than fourth quarter. At quarter-end, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $13 billion and our net debt position was about $21 billion. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2015 earnings were approximately $1.9 billion lower than first quarter 2014 results. Upstream earnings decreased $2.7 billion between quarters; significantly lower crude realizations were partially offset by positive foreign exchange effects, higher gains on asset sales and favorable tax items. Foreign exchange gains in the first quarter were substantial, $580 million in total. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. Downstream results increased by over $700 million, primarily driven by stronger worldwide refining and marketing margins. Operationally, first quarter results were amongst the very best we've had in several years, a perfect combination of margin strength and improved refining reliability. The variance in the other segment was primarily associated with the absence of an impaired recognized in first quarter 2014 following sustation [ph] of certain mining operations, primarily offset by higher tax and other corporate charges. Turning to slide 6, I'll now compare results for the first quarter 2015 with the fourth quarter of 2014. First quarter earnings were approximately $900 million lower than fourth quarter results. Upstream earnings decreased by approximately $1.1 billion between quarters, reflecting lower realizations and assets on gains partially offset by lower impairments and operating costs. Downstream earnings were lower by $95 million, stronger U.S. margins and lower operating expenses across the global systems were more than offset by the absence of gains on asset sales recognized in the fourth quarter and an unfavorable swing and timing effects between quarters. The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges. Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment.\nJeff Gustavson: Thanks Pat. Turning to slide 7. Our U.S. upstream earnings for the first quarter were about $900 million lower than fourth quarter's results. Sharply lower liquids realizations decreased earnings by $735 million, our crude and liquids realizations all dropped by approximately 35% between periods. Gains on asset sales were lower by $330 million. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a gain following the sale of our interests in certain LPG pipeline assets, which are associated with the upstream segment. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items. Lower operating and exploration expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation charges, including impairments for several smaller assets. Turning to slide 8. International upstream earnings were about $200 million lower than last quarter's results. Significantly lower crude prices impacted earnings by $1.3 billion. Our average international crude realizations were down over 30% between quarters, consistent with the decline in Brent prices. Lower operating expenses across multiple countries increased earnings by $335 million. In March, the U.K. government implemented a change in the petroleum tax law retroactive to the beginning of the year, which resulted in a one-time deferred tax benefit of $350 million. The absence of impairments from the prior quarter increased earnings by $570 million, while lower gains on asset sales this quarter decreased earnings by $360 million. The other bar included multiple components. Two notable drivers for this positive variance were stronger liftings and foreign exchange effects. Slide 9 summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014. Net production increased by almost 100,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price effects increased production by 55,000 barrels per day as lower crude prices increased cost recovery and other volumes associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts. Major capital project ramp ups at Jack/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico and from the expansion of the Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh, increased production by 42,000 barrels per day. Plant turnaround activity was heavy in the fourth quarter, particularly at our SGI/SGP facilities in Kazakhstan as well as in Thailand and Australia. First quarter by contrast was much lighter in planned maintenance and this accounted for higher production of 36,000 barrels per day between periods. Growth from shale and tight assets, primarily in the Permian contributed 10,000 barrels per day. External constrains, primarily lower gas demands in Southeast Asia as well as weather-related impacts decreased production by 18,000 barrels per day. The remaining variance in the base business and other bar reflects greater unplanned downtime in other non-related items. Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter 2015 and the first quarter 2014. Net production increased by 93,000 barrels per day between periods. Price effects increased production by 71,000 barrels per day due to the roughly 50% drop in crude prices between periods. Last year, Brent averaged $108 per barrel in the first quarter. This year Brent averaged $54 per barrel in the first quarter. Shale and tight production increased by 43,000 barrels per day due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian as well as in the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina. Major capital projects increased production by 35,000 barrels per day. Production ramp-ups in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Bangladesh, Trinidad and Brazil were all positives. The shutdown of Angola LNG which occurred subsequent to last year's first quarter partially offset these increases. Asset sales resulted in loss production of 34,000 barrels per day, principally driven by divestments of our assets in Chad and in the Netherlands. The decrease of 22,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects normal field declines, partially offset by lower turnaround activity and unplanned downtime. Our base business continues to perform well with the managed decline rate below our existing guidance. First quarter net production rate of 2.681 million barrels per day is a strong start to the year and is above the flat to 3% growth range we indicated in January as our production guidance. While this is above our guidance, it is important to remember that we have maintenance turnarounds and asset sales plans for later in the year. I would also like to comment on an issue we mentioned in our 10-K about our operations in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait where we produced 76,000 barrels per day net in the first quarter. It now appears more likely that our future production levels in the Partitioned Zone could be negatively impacted due to our inability to secure work and equipment permits. The potential for a shutdown of production was not anticipated in our flat to 3% guidance range. We do not know for sure how production impact will occur and if does occur, we cannot estimate its duration. In any case, we estimate that the 2015 financial impact from a potential shutdown would be minimal. Turning to slide 11. US downstream results decreased $183 million between quarters. Importantly, the operational results noted in the green bars were over $500 million stronger between periods. Margins increased earnings by $435 million driven by unplanned industry downtime and tight product supply on the US West Coast. US Gulf Coast margins were also strong reflecting industry refinery maintenance patterns and strong seasonal demand. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $110 million primarily associated with reduced turnaround in maintenance activities. Timing effects represented a $250 million decrease to earnings mainly due to the absence of positive year-end inventory effects recognized in the fourth quarter and unfavorable mark-to-market swings between quarters on derivatives tied to underlying physical assets. The absence of gains on asset transactions from the prior quarter decreased earnings by $460 million. Turning to slide 12. International downstream earnings improved by $88 million between quarters. Lower margins decreased earnings by $70 million. Marketing margins fell, largely the result of product pricing lag effects evident in both Asia and Australia. Reduced operating expenses increased earnings by $120 million. Timing effects represented a $215 million decrease to earnings. As in the US segment, this represented the absence of favorable year-end inventory effects booked in the fourth quarter and adverse swings between the quarters and mark-to-market valuations on derivatives tied to underlying physical assets. The absence of one-time charge in fourth quarter related the economic buyout of a legacy pension liability increased earnings by $160 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items. The largest single component was favorable foreign currency effects. With that, I\u2019d like to now turn it back to Pat.\nPat Yarrington: All right, thanks, Jeff. Turning now to slide 13. In response to the downturn, we are aggressively pursuing cost savings. Excluding fuel, operating cost in the first quarter are down 13% from the average 2014 quarter. To-date, we have completed more than 2,200 supplier engagements with 700 more in progress. We\u2019re working across all spend categories to negotiate supplier reductions and to rebid contracts when sufficient reductions have not been offered. The results have been encouraging with over $900 million of contract savings already negotiated. The pie chart shows upstream spend categories, [00:00:57] our supplier cost reduction effort and the $900 million quoted is enterprise-wide. This represents cash savings we expect to capture in 2015. We\u2019ll see it show up as the year unfolds in multiple ways; lower operating expenses, reduced capital outlays, and decreases in cost of goods sold. Spend categories closer to the Wellhead and activities with the shorter term contracts as well as shorter cycle times from order date to delivery date are seeing the sharpest declines. We\u2019re also seeing more immediate responsiveness from suppliers supporting our US operations. Looking externally for improvements is only part of addressing our cost structure. We\u2019re also reengineering our internal work processes, initiating organization reviews, rightsizing our work teams to better match spend and activity levels and all of this to align with current market conditions. Our objective is a simpler, more efficient, more productive and affordable organization that directly supports our business priorities. Finally, we are pursuing capital and operating efficiencies throughout the organization, getting more for each dollar of spend. In the upstream, we are applying our experience with running manufacturing type operations to our shale and tight developments in the US and elsewhere. This is driving significant efficiency improvements and lowering the costs of our horizontal well programs in both the Midland and Delaware basins. In the downstream, we are using tools like Lean Six Sigma to improve efficiency throughout our operations and one specific example, we\u2019ve shortened the downtime by 30% associated with terminal and tank inspection and maintenance activities, which should lead to sizeable cost savings over time. Turning to slide 14. You recall a key commitment from our March presentation related to covering our dividend in 2017 from free cash flow. We outlined how we intended to do that and I like to put a few of our accomplishments into that context. Cash flow growth is a near-term priority. While absolute prices in the first quarter were not favorable, our production was. Base business performance was strong and our base decline rate was less than 2%. We also continue to ramp up at Jack/St. Malo in the Gulf of Mexico. The fifth well is now online and growth production is up to over 70,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent, exceeding initial expectations. We completed some critical milestones on the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects in Australia. At Gorgon, we started up the first gas turbine generator successfully, an important step in the overall plant commissioning process. At Wheatstone, we successfully installed the topside for the offshore platform -- production platform. We have posted new pictures today and a video of both projects will be posted early next week. I encourage you to look at these on our investor website at chevron.com. And finally, our downstream and chemicals business is performing very well. We do think spend is our second priority. I\u2019ve already talked through the cost structure savings we\u2019re pursuing. In addition to that, we\u2019re on a clear path to reduce capital spending over the next several years as our major capital projects come online and our spending flexibility increases. Budgeted capital spending is planned at $35 billion this year, a 13% reduction from 2014. Cash spending is down -- this quarter is down 11% from first quarter a year ago. By 2017, we expect to have over $8 billion in additional C&E flexibility compared to 2015. And finally, we\u2019re making excellent progress on our asset sales. We realized almost $6 billion in proceeds last year and will be adding nearly $4 billion to that in the first four months of this year with a recently completed lease sales in Nigeria and the divestiture of Caltex Australia. In 16 months, we\u2019ve achieved almost $10 billion in total sales proceeds versus a $15 billion 48-month target. We will continue to sell assets when we can generate good value. Moving to slide 15, I would like to close by reiterating the near-term value proposition that Chevron offers. We expect to deliver industry-leading volume growth between now and 2017. That growth is sourced from Gorgon and Wheatstone in Australia, Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot in the Gulf of Mexico and Mafumeira Sul and Angola LNG in Angola. In addition, we are poised for a significant growth in our shale and tight resources, particularly in the Permian in the US. On top of the pure volume growth, we also offer margin expansion. The cash margins associated with these projects, primarily in the orange portion of the shaded bar, are projected higher than our cash margins today and many significant leasehold. By 2017, we expect our cash margins on our overall portfolio to increase by approximately 35% from where they are today assuming $60 average Brent price this year and $70 average Brent price in 2017, which is consistent with current futures prices. We believe that our outsized volume growth combined with outsized margin should lead to outsized value growth for our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks, and I appreciate you listening in this morning. We are now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we already have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary and we will do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\nEd Westlake: Good morning, Pat and congratulations Jeff on the move, and welcome to Frank. Just I guess the question around cash flow to start with. Thanks for shouting out the working capital, I think the market would have had kittens if it was a $2 billion CFO number. I mean obviously, if you have net income and DD&A, you get a high number, but I presume some of the deltas or things like dividends from associates being less than net income and the timing of tax payments, if there is any color on that? But my general question is, how does this cash flow stack up against your internal expectations for the quarter appreciate, obviously the oil price is very low. And has anything changed in terms of your cash flow projections going forward in what you see as a more normalized oil price?\nPat Yarrington: Okay, yeah, thanks, Ed, appreciate the question and I appreciate everybody\u2019s interest in cash. You\u2019re right. So it was a low cash from operations quarter, but we did have $2 billion of adverse working capital effects, so if you added those back, we would be at about $4.3 billion. What I would say is, if you looked at our sensitivity on oil price relative to prior quarters and look at it this quarter, this very much is in-line and in fact, it\u2019s actually a little bit stronger than just a pure sensitivity would suggest. I\u2019ll just mention the number again for everybody, it\u2019s somewhere between $325 million and $350 million per dollar Brent change. So we\u2019ve had a significant drop in Brent prices, and therefore a significant drop in earnings as well as cash flow. You\u2019re absolutely right, Ed, that there were some decrements relative to normal quarters in terms of the amount of affiliate distributions that we received. This quarter was, I would say, pretty minimal in terms of that. We do expect that to turnaround in the subsequent three quarters, so that\u2019s just a timing issue. In terms of how this looks relative to our plan going forward, if you recall the numbers that we showed you in March, the slides that we showed you with financial projections, all assumed a $60 world for Brent, and I think we\u2019re exactly in that phase. And so I look at our profile this year in terms of how earnings have come in and cash have come in and assuming we end up at a $60 world for Brent, which looks very reasonable given where the futures markets are than I think we are exactly on plan and very consistent with the cash profile that we showed you back in March. And you\u2019ll recall, for everybody, that we did have a significant deficit anticipated in 2015 and then we showed you the pattern of how we would move out of that deficit out to 2017, getting full coverage of our dividend by 2017. I mentioned the asset sales that we have, the first quarter was nearly $1 billion and here in April already, we have the sale as well. So already through four months, we've got a significant contribution of about $4 billion. So asset sales are a key component there as well.\nEd Westlake: Thank you. I think I asked three questions in one. So I will defer to the next in line.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, Pat, Jeff.\nPat Yarrington: Good morning.\nJeff Gustavson: Good morning.\nNeil Mehta: So Pat, I wanted you to talk through the dividend here and just how we're thinking about dividend growth, historically, you\u2019ve raised the dividend in the second quarter earlier this week. You kept it flat, so want to see if this represents the departure from the views on dividend growth or maybe just the change in the timing on when you evaluate it?\nPat Yarrington: It's a good question, Neil and let me just start by saying that maintaining a competitive and growing dividend is our number one priority. That has not changed. Our financial priorities have not changed, but what has changed is our immediate financial environment, the near-term environment has changed and so the board chose not to increase the dividend this quarter. It is similar to what we did back in 2008 and 2009, when prices last fell significantly. We are supporting a 3.8% yield, but clearly, we are not running very strongly on earnings or cash flow at the moment due to commodity prices. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the first quarter was not a very stable financial environment, it was very fluid in terms of both revenues and costs. And so I think our overall decision is going to be based on what we feel is affordable and supportable in perpetuity, because we don't want to get into a position where we are having to cut the dividend or trim the dividend in anyway. And therefore, the timing and the size of an increase will be a function of how cash and earnings and asset sales or major capital projects execution and frankly, future commodity prices, I mean that is a significant factor, how those all play out in the coming quarters. And really how we see commodity prices playing out over a longer sweep of time. All of those factors will influence that decision.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Pat. And then want to come back to your point on the neutral zone. And I think Jeff, you made the point that the financial impact would be limited or immaterial. The number you shadowed out there represents about 3% of your volumes, so curious as to why earnings impact could be immaterial, is that because the margins associated with those barrels could be lower and just a broader status update on the [indiscernible] field would be helpful as well.\nPat Yarrington: Yes. So essentially you are right. The financial impact is minimal because of the relationship to margins essentially. And then on the steamflood status, it was our -- we did have steam breakthroughs, so we did have success in that pilot. It was our expectation, it is our expectation to go into feed later this year, perhaps around the third quarter, but obviously depending upon circumstances and how they unfold over the next few weeks and these discussions between Saudi and the Kuwaitis on the partition zone. It could be \u2013 there could be somewhat of an impact there. I will say that there are discussions that are ongoing underway because this is obviously a very serious circumstance and it's being taken seriously. So we put a lot of could and potential and words like that in our language, because we really don't know and the hope is that this can get solved, we are optimistic that this can get solved.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you, Pat. And Jeff, congratulations.\nJeff Gustavson: Thank you, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.\nPhil Gresh: Hey. Good morning, Pat. Congrats, Jeff and Frank. First question is just on the OpEx. Thank you for the helpful color on that front. I guess what I'm wondering is as we think about how the first quarter progressed on a year-over-year or a quarter-over-quarter basis and what you called out relative to I believe it was John\u2019s commentary last quarter, I think the last cycle you talked about a $4 billion saved number, kind of where do you think you are in those structural sales opportunities and how we should sequentially be thinking about this as we look at 2Q and the second half?\nPat Yarrington: Right. I think that our profile at least what we've seen so far in the first quarter with all of the concerted and systematic effort that we've got underway throughout the entire enterprise, I feel that we should have really good operating expense trends as we move through the remaining three quarters of the year. We are seeing cost reductions over a whole series of cost categories anywhere from 10% to 20% and some of that of course will end up in OpEx spend, some of that will end up in capital expenditures, lower capital outlays, but I would just say from the response on the part of suppliers, the intensity with which we are pursuing this, the fact that if we are not getting the cost reductions that we are anticipating from a given supplier that we are willing to move market share and have done so, all of that I think bodes very well for our bottom line and our cash spend really over the course of subsequent periods here.\nPhil Gresh: So just a clarification. If you were to maybe put it in terms of innings like what you actually realized in the first quarter because I think the OpEx is down $600 million year-over-year, so I am just trying make that for with $4 billion number and think about how far along you are versus are you actually in the early stages?\nPat Yarrington: I think we're in the very early stages in terms of what has been recognized in the first quarter results. So I think there is a lot of potential still to come.\nJeff Gustavson: This is Jeff. Just to be clear, the $4 billion was a 2009 number. What we saw back in 2009, nothing that we put out here recently.\nPhil Gresh: Understood. Just on -- my second question is on CPChem. I think there has been some discussion out there about the potential to maybe officially leverage that balance sheet. So maybe you could just talk about your thoughts on that and whether there's any potential of that in 2015?\nPat Yarrington: Okay, sure. In the past, CPChem has held debt. And then they've gone through a period here where they were generating tremendous amounts of cash and dividending that to their parents. Now they are in a position where they have investment opportunities through that US Gulf Coast cracker project and so it would not be unreasonable to think that they would go into the debt market in order to fund some of their investment opportunities.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nEvan Calio: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nPat Yarrington: Good morning.\nEvan Calio: Yeah, thanks for the comment on the dividend and maybe I will kind of try further there. I know in 2009 you raised the dividend in July of your typical kind of April-May period for the raise after a moderate commodity recovery. I know there are many factors and the board ultimately sets the dividend. What's the key metric that\u2019s your focus when you are looking at that decision and does it differ today at all because you are in a kind of bigger project ramp-up period? Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: So I really think it's important to take a long-term view on the dividend and the outlook on cash and earnings over a longer sweep of time. So I think that is really morphed. Fundamentally the issue then will we happen to sit on our capital program at this particular point time. And I think it is fair to say that with what's happened in oil markets in the last six to nine months, there is a complete reshaping of what's going on, a rebalancing of what's going on. And I think it's reasonable to think that taking sometime to understand where things shake out for the long-term is a very important and prudent step. I don't want to get ahead of what the board's views on this might be, so I can't really comment any further. The dividend is very important to us. We want remain competitive on it. We pay attention to our yield, we pay attention to our payouts on earnings and our payouts on cash flows. We want to be competitive on this, we want to continue to grow it. So all I can say is, it\u2019s got high priority and this is something that gets looked at every single quarter and profiles on out in terms of earnings and cash flows gets looked at every quarter by the board.\nEvan Calio: Great. That's fair. I appreciate that. And then a follow-up on the \u2013 particularly, congratulations on the Caltex sale. On the downstream, can you give us any idea of how you expect that asset sale, those assets sales have affected your returns in the downstream portfolio. So as we roll forward with international, I know it was in non-consolidated, but how they compare relative to the rest of your portfolio and how that portfolio may look absent Caltex? Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: Yeah, so, I think you -- we should commented as it had a positive contribution, obviously, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be noticeable in any meaningful way. Its absence will not be noticeable in any meaningful way.\nEvan Calio: Okay, yes, fair enough, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please?\nPaul Sankey: Hi, good morning everybody, and Jeff, thank you for everything, it\u2019s been a pleasure.\nJeff Gustavson: Thanks.\nPaul Sankey: Can I just ask about the Neutral Zone again, how much did you see in for volumes in your targets for this year and for the 2017 3.1?\nPat Yarrington: So, this year would have been in the neighborhood of what we produced in the first quarter here, which was around 76,000 barrels a day. We would have been anticipating a decline between 2015 and 2017 to something a little around 60, maybe 62,000 barrels a day in 2017.\nPaul Sankey: Good. And so, Pat, you\u2019re saying that basically that margins are so low there that regardless of losing whatever it is, 70 -- 60 -- 70,000 barrels a day, the financial impact will literally be minimal?\nPat Yarrington: Yes.\nPaul Sankey: Well, okay. That was the -- that was the volume question. Is there anything to add on the California downstream market and I\u2019ll leave with that? Thanks a lot.\nPat Yarrington: So, I think in California, we had the fortunate position of having high reliability at a time when the overall industry market was very tight and it was tight for a couple of operational reasons related to other industry -- other industry players. As those get resolved and I think one has been resolved and one is going to take a little bit longer to resolve, but as those get resolved and I think you would anticipate that the margins would move towards a more normal -- a more normal level. Of course, second quarter is typically a reasonable margin period because of gasoline demand pickup. So, there is seasonality factors there, but in general, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the West Coast margin was impacted significantly here in the first quarter because of these industry factors and Chevron ran well, operated well and was able to take advantage of that.\nPaul Sankey: Pat, it\u2019s totally obscure, but I was wondering was that part -- was California part of the working -- why was the working capital movements so enormous in the quarter I guess is what I should have asked. Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: It\u2019s a good question. It was really a function. When you look at our working capital elements here, the biggest drivers really just related to a disproportionate movement in the way our accounts payable and our accounts receivables moved over the quarter\u2019s period of time. Normally, when you are in a more stable price environment, then you expect whatever happens and your receivables and payables to offset. That did that happen in this particular period. And so, we had a net cash consumption of size related to accounts payable, receivables net and this is where I said and I feel very comfortable saying that we expect this to unwind as the quarters progress.\nPaul Sankey: I guess what I\u2019m driving at is, the history of that typically is the California operations have a lot of long distance crude, is that what we\u2019re talking about here or is there dollar effect or something?\nPat Yarrington: No, it\u2019s not what we\u2019re -- it\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about and in the past, when we talked about, we\u2019ve had working capital effects related to the California. In many of those circumstances in the past that has been related to the operations, the specific operations or lack of operations at Richmond. That is not the scenario that we\u2019re talking about this year.\nPaul Sankey: But I\u2019m still not to why it\u2019s so big, I mean, you say it\u2019s payables, receivables type move, but I just wonder, is it the dollar or is it, what is it?\nPat Yarrington: I mean, it\u2019s just the rate of activity change between what\u2019s happened on your revenue side and what\u2019s happened on your cost side.\nPaul Sankey: Okay, I will leave at that. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please?\nPaul Cheng: Hey, guys. First, Jeff just want to say thank you for all the help over the last couple of years and best of luck with your new assignment and Frank, welcome aboard to the IR lane. Pat, on the first quarter, the cost saving realization in the P&L, I think you mention talking about $600 million. How much of [indiscernible] in many of the area that you operate as much weaker than the US dollar, so as a result, in US dollar term, the cost is down?\nPat Yarrington: So, your question is about foreign exchange, the 600 -- roughly $580 million.\nPaul Cheng: No, I am not talking about the $580 million, which is related to currency translation. I am talking about the actual operating cost, because let\u2019s say, you pay your employee in UK with the pound and then get translated into your US dollar, even if the cost base will remain the same in local currency in US dollar is much lower, so that\u2019s the amount that I am just curious, how -- of the 600, how much is related to that?\nPat Yarrington: So the \u2013 it\u2019s really \u2013 they\u2019re not related. I mean, our operating expense, the influence of foreign exchange on our operating expense is really pretty minimal through the quarter. It\u2019s more significant in terms of capital spending, but on an operating expense base it has not \u2013 it is not a significant component that has led to the decline in operating expense between periods.\nPaul Cheng: Interesting. So given that in many of your major operating area, the dollar have strengthened against their local currency, but is not much of an impact in USA?\nPat Yarrington: That\u2019s correct.\nPaul Cheng: I see. Okay. All right, that\u2019s fine. A final one that\u2019s real quick, over-lifting and under-lifting in the quarter?\nPat Yarrington: Yeah, we\u2019re about 1.7% under-lifted for the quarter.\nPaul Cheng: And Pat, at the end of the quarter, do you still under-lift or do you upper-lift or over-lift?\nPat Yarrington: I don\u2019t know, Frank. I just know for the quarter, it was 1.7% and I don\u2019t know \u2013\nFrank Mount: No, at the end of the quarter, Paul, it was \u2013 we were 1.7% under-lifted, that\u2019s at the end of the quarter.\nPat Yarrington: At the end of the quarter, okay.\nPaul Cheng: And how about for the quarter your sales?\nPat Yarrington: Within the quarter?\nPaul Cheng: Yes, means that the quarter sales comparing to the quarter production, are we over-lift or under-lift?\nFrank Mount: I\u2019ll have to follow-up with you that. Paul, I don\u2019t have that number with me, but the 1.7% is the number that you should focus on.\nPaul Cheng: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning everyone. And Jeff, let me also say thanks to all your help. Welcome Frank. I got to say, I am optimistic on a better Q position with Frank. I want to see how it goes. On asset sales, you are two-thirds of the way through the $15 billion number. One can, you help thinking with maybe some upside yet again to that target. Could you frame for us how you\u2019re thinking about that. And if could [indiscernible] this year. One of your competitors in your backyard in California seems pretty keen on asset sales, I am just curious on the other side of the ledger, if you have taken a hard look at bolt-ons to your existing California position? And then I do have a related follow-up.\nPat Yarrington: Yeah, so we did just increase the target back in March moving to the $15 billion over the four years. We are only six weeks later than that approximately now. And even though the CAL sale is a significant transaction and we\u2019re happy to have it behind us, I am not in a position to change the overall target. I feel very comfortable about our ability to conclude the $15 billion over the next year and a half or so that are remaining, actually it\u2019s more than that, more than two and a half years, two and a half years that are remaining. So I don\u2019t want to up that target, but I feel comfortable about our ability to hit that target in the timeframe that we have set. CAL will be booked in the second quarter, it was not a first quarter item. And then in terms of any sort of bolt-on activity, obviously we look at circumstances of assets and opportunities around the globe. We evaluate that all the time. I am not going to speak specifically about anything that\u2019s under consideration or not under consideration. It has a pretty high hurdle is all I would say in order to move into our portfolio at this time. Any sort of additional portfolio move like that would have a pretty high hurdle because it would need to compete post acquisition for capital against the assets that we already have in queue.\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate. And my follow-up is, I am afraid I am going to label the working capital issue, just to leave that more, if I may. My sense is at least when you have such a massive move than the oil price at least, a slow down on activity levels, the payables that you would have as a source of working capital, as you pay those, in other words, as cash goes out the door, the subsequent payables that would replace those would be substantially lower assuming your activity level was reduced. So, what I'm trying to understand is, where is your confidence or can you help us walk through why that after a such move in the oil price that working capital position would reverse out if your activity level is moved to a lower level, just your view on that. [ph]\nPat Yarrington: Well, I think it's really the combination, I mean; I look at these on a net basis, right. I look at the movement in your receivables and the movement in your payables and as I say, as you get into a stable environment, any sort of price impact that you get, typically moves through both of those in a relatively synonymous way or a synchronized way. And so, when you\u2019re in a discontinuous situation like you had in the first quarter, I think, when you get into a stable environment, if prices have come down, and cost structure has come down, then you get into a matching there, and so I think that is what I'm really trying to imply is that, as you move into that matching phase, that's where you will get the reversal and you'll return to a more normal relationship between receivables and payables.\nDoug Leggate: Is that through the course of the year, Pat, or you would expect a more quicker resolution for that or is it going to kind of ramp higher or going to be balanced over time?\nPat Yarrington: Accounts payable receivables, I would expect to begin reversing relatively quickly here. I think it's a trend, a change in the pattern that you will see in the second quarter.\nDoug Leggate: Great, I will leave at that. Thanks very much indeed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil, your question please.\nBlake Fernandez: Folks, good morning and I would also offer congratulations to both Jeff and Frank. I had two questions, one, could you give an update on the recently formed JV you did in the Gulf of Mexico with Keathley Canyon, any status update or game plan as you kind of take over operatorship there?\nPat Yarrington: Well, I think you know, I think I'd like to leave a lot of that for our second quarter here, because our plans are to have Jeff -- Jay Johnson on the line with us in second quarter, and I think we'll let the opportunities go there. But we're pleased with the joint development opportunity that we've got here, this really builds on our Anchor discovery and our Guadalupe discovery and it combines the Tiber and Gila discoveries where BP had success there and so we feel like it's a very good development opportunity potentially for hubs where you can get scale assets, economic assets and going forward, we have a lot of continuing appraisal work to do though. So I don't really want to say much more than that.\nBlake Fernandez: Fair enough, we can follow-up next quarter with Jay. The second question Pat is really kind of on the U.S. in particular, where we saw negative earnings, I guess, I viewed the Gulf and Permian as key growth areas where we would expect fairly high margins, I realized there were some impairments kind of one-off in the quarter, but you highlight DD&A being elevated, is it fair to believe that DD&A kind of remains at an elevated level until we book additional reserves over time? And if I could may be just sneak in a -- finally a follow-up on the Partitioned Zone. You mentioned the financial impact being minimal, I presume that applies to both earnings and cash flow, but if you could please just confirm that, I would appreciate it. Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: Yeah, so just sticking with the upstream loss position, I think we have to look at what the driver was here for the loss position, obviously very poor realizations, only $43 a barrel and liquids realizations, gas overall was $2 in the quarter roughly. So, the significant decline in revenues. I talked about what's happening on our cost structure side of things but we're going to see the cost structure come down with lag effects, you're not going to see that in a first quarter period of time, so the cost structure is continuing to evolve and so first quarter again was not a particularly pretty picture from a margin standpoint. On depreciation, you're right, we are seeing elevated depreciation and you would expect that depreciation to remain elevated and particularly for some of our deepwater assets until we have time to do, we get response time and we can see what the full recoverable, we can document kind of the full recoverable opportunity of that development play is. And back on PZ, it is the same earnings and cash.\nBlake Fernandez: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies, your question please.\nJason Gammel: Thanks very much, hi everyone. Just wanted to come to the milestones that you've achieved in Australia over the course of the quarter. The first question related to the first gas into turbine at Gorgon, that's obviously a huge milestone, is that being accomplished with gas from your hydrogen [ph] offshore or you\u2019re getting that from third-party sources and if it's not hydrogen, you still expect first gas somewhere around mid-year?\nPat Yarrington: It's coming from domestic gas sources and yes, our expectation really is to have, we are on schedule for our Gorgon startup in the third quarter of this year and first gas, before the end of the year.\nJason Gammel: And do you mean, first commercial cargoes, is that \u2013\nPat Yarrington: First commercial cargoes, sorry.\nJason Gammel: Okay, great.\nPat Yarrington: First LNG before the end of the year.\nJason Gammel: Got it. And then obviously another major milestone you achieved at Wheatstone with the top side placement, but I guess from a schedule standpoint, I would expect that the onshore has got the most potential for slippage, just from a risk standpoint, can you talk about where you are at relative to schedule in terms of the onshore at Wheatstone?\nPat Yarrington: Yes. So we are on schedule for Wheatstone. Obviously, the installation of the top sides on the steel gravity structure was a major milestone. But we've got seven of 24 process modules, major process modules that have been delivered on site. The trunk line is installed and hydro tested. The dredging is complete, the piling activities are completed, the roofs are on both of the LNG tanks, so we continue to make good progress both onshore and offshore and I do encourage you to take a look at the pictures that are on the website, because you'll be able to see the progress there.\nJason Gammel: Okay. Very good. Thanks, folks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. As you are getting into 2015, presumably there was a lift of FIDs the company had on deck, are there any of those other than perhaps Kitimat that have been pushed out or suspended since January 1?\nPat Yarrington: So, I would say the most significant, in fact the only really significant FID that\u2019s on plan for this year relates to TCO and the future growth project and we continue to work that through to FID obviously, it's an opportunity for us to take advantage of a lower cost structure, so we continue to do more detailed engineering and work through the cost estimates of this, continue to work with our partners and the government on this, so our expectation is fourth-quarter FID on that one.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay, understood.\nPat Yarrington: And in terms of the other FID projects, I mean part of the reduction that we took in our capital spending from 2014 to 2015 really did relate to the pacing of other major capital projects. Kitimat is a primary one there. We've moved that, I guess, I would say the spending on that out considerably. We are really only limiting ourselves here to appraisal work and continuing to look at the design and the cost structure of that. Indonesia deepwater development would have been another one. That has moved out. So there several other FIDs or pre-FID projects that we have pushed to see any monies into future years.\nPavel Molchanov: And if I can ask a follow-up about the downstream segment, you've been pretty vocal in the past about the frustrations with California policy on carbon emissions in particular, given the decision last week to extend those rules out to 2030, does that change your view about perhaps retaining any of the California refining assets?\nPat Yarrington: Well, I would just say that we are in a very advantaged California position. We've got two very strong world-class -- very competitive assets at Richmond and El Segundo. We've got a very good market position, very good brand strength. So, it\u2019s a quality asset that we have here and our expectation is that we will be able, over time, to work with whatever the regulatory framework is. At the same time, we do still think it's important to alert customers and alert government officials as to what the cost of compliance is for some of these programs. The AB32, the cap and trade portion, fuels under the cap came in to effect in January of this year and there are costs, new costs associated with being a refiner in the state as a result of that. Now, it does get passed on to consumers and so as that continues to move forward, then of course that cost increase could be something that consumers and regulators will be increasingly aware of.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody and let me be one of the last to wish you good luck, Jeff, in the next assignment and welcome Frank. If I could just go maybe with a couple of specific ones, Angola LNG I think at the Analyst Day you updated, you expected it to come on stream during the fourth quarter of this year back on stream. Any update on progress there that was maybe a little bit earlier than some of our expectations and maybe what all did you end up having to do to the project to get it ready for this year?\nPat Yarrington: Okay. So work is still underway, significantly underway and the overall plan is to still have Angola LNG restart with LNG to the tank in the fourth quarter of this year, probably late in the fourth quarter of this year and then begin to ramp-up to about 75% of capacity by the first quarter of 2015. As is common, the plant will run for a period of time and then ALNG will make a decision as to whether or not they need to take the plant down to perform any sort of shut down, drain removal, that kind of cleanup activity. And they all decide at that point in time whether or not they want to do that early in the first part of 2016. In any case, we would expect ALNG to reach maximum capacity in the second quarter of 2016 if they decide to do those drain removals.\nRyan Todd: Great. And I appreciate that. And then maybe just one general one, wondered if you can give couple of comments in your release, but I would appreciate any clarity as we've got varying views from different companies over in recent times. Any view on general product demand globally, both in the US and globally what you are seeing across your system? Any demand sort of weak or strong in different parts of the system as well?\nPat Yarrington: I would say that going forward here and I'm thinking really globally here that product demand -- there are some leading indicators that would suggest the product demand as strengthening, I guess I would say modestly. And overall, probably have an overall demand profile for 2015 that would be somewhat stronger than 2014 from an oil consumption standpoint.\nRyan Todd: And in the US, I think in your release it said that the product sales were, I can\u2019t remember, they were flat year-on-year versus 1Q14. Is that US gasoline, is that kind of same-store sales across your system or what number is that?\nPat Yarrington: I'm not sure, which number are you talking, are you looking in the release itself?\nRyan Todd: Yeah. I think it said branded gasoline sales were essentially flat with 2014, is that \u2013 so I am guessing that's kind of the same-store sales?\nPat Yarrington: Well, it really is networks, it's our total network sales. Total network sales. It's really just a function of our branded distributions, right. I mean, our network hasn't changed significantly between periods of time.\nRyan Todd: That's helpful. Alright. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nRoger Read: Yeah, good morning.\nPat Yarrington: Good morning.\nRoger Read: I guess I would like to follow-up, it hasn't gotten much here this time around. Permian, kind of give us an update maybe what you are doing there, maybe your progression on rig count and then also how the cost deflation is flowing through there?\nPat Yarrington: Okay. So our current outlook really for the Permian is to have about 21 rigs running. Currently in the March meeting we said it was something closer to 25. We expect to have about 325 gross wells this year. And that's down a little bit from what we said just a few week ago. Some of the reduction in the wells is due to a shift to horizontal drilling programs versus vertical drilling programs. And some of it also relates to joint venture arrangements what our joint development partner has reduced their activity levels compared to plans. We are transitioning more and more to horizontal work as opposed to vertical work. Horizontal wells obviously work better in this kind of a price environment. And I would just say that we are seeing very good well by well improvement in costs in each of these wells going forward. I think the cost reduction efforts are finding their way through to our overall drilling and completions cost, and we will be happy to give you a larger update, more in-depth update on our second quarter call.\nRoger Read: Okay. And then the other question I had is we could get back to \u2013 it was chart 14, you talked about flexibility in your spending going forward. I didn\u2019t catch the number, but I was just wondering if we should think about that as kind of \u2013 one, give us the number. Number two, can we think about that as ratable as we work through or is it very much going to be chunky as, for example, Gorgon gets going at the end of this year and obviously the CapEx drops off. And then how that may change the way the future FID process will work its way through as well?\nPat Yarrington: Right. So the number that we provided between 2015 and 2017 is $8 billion cumulatively. And I think it\u2019s reasonable for you to think about that as reasonably ratable. I mean, it does really depend and it is forced heavily by the Gorgon and Wheatstone spend follow-up. But I think for purposes of what you\u2019re most likely doing I think thinking about it as being reasonably ratable make sense.\nRoger Read: Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks, and Jeff and Frank, good luck in new ventures. And Frank, I guess we will be talking together quite a lot more.\nJeff Gustavson: Thank you.\nFrank Mount: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Due to time constraints, our final question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how cost savings that you\u2019ve realized today have aligned with what was contemplated by your original CapEx budget, if you are seeking cost deflation happen more quickly than you would have expected. I'm just looking at the international CapEx number for the first quarter, hence down $2 billion, is that good cost savings or is that just normal inter-quarter [ph] volatility?\nPat Yarrington: All right. So I would say in general, the cost savings that we are seeing and that we anticipate seeing would probably be somewhat stronger than what we had baked into our $35 billion budget. And that's really just a function of when we were doing the budget and what we were anticipating versus what we are -- we believe being able to secure going forward. I don't think you will have seen much of that in the quarter-to-quarter comparisons as of yet, so what you're seeing quarter-to-quarter comparisons really has more to do with the pattern of actual spending from fourth to first.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, understood. And just thinking about that, if you prorate the first quarter for the full year, you are already below the $35 billion number. How should we think about the CapEx trajectory throughout 2015?\nPat Yarrington: Yeah, I think you should think about it as being relatively evenly paced. The $35 billion target is what we expect to hit at the end of the year.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day."}], "2017": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2016, "date": "2017-01-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please, go ahead.\nJohn Watson: Thanks Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Frank Mount, our General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on our website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Okay, let's start with the key messages on Slide 3. I've said we needed to do five things well to adjust the lower prices. First, finish project under construction which reduces spend and brings on new revenue. Gorgon Train 1 and 2, Shandong Bay, Bangka, Alder, Angola LNG are all on production and stable. In 2017 progress will continue with Gorgon Train 3 and Wheatstone coming online. Second, we need to reduce capital expenditures and focus on work that's profitable lower prices. 2016 capital was down 34% or $11.6 billion from 2015. We're further reducing capital spending in 2017 and investing a larger percentage of capital in short cycle high return opportunities presented by our advantage portfolio. Third, we are lowering operating expenses by getting more efficient in all that we do. 2016 operating expense was down 9% or $2.5 billion from 2015 and we expect further reductions in 2017. Fourth, we need to complete planned asset sales. We're on track with $2.8 billion in proceeds in 2016 and we expect 2017 proceeds will likely move us toward the upper end of the 2016, 2017 guidance range of $5 billion to $10 billion we previously communicated. And finally we need to do all of this while operating safely and reliably. The result, free cash flow is improving with momentum building through 2016. We expect to be cash balanced in 2017 and the cash flow improvement continuing to 2018 and beyond. Our actions support our number one financial priority which is maintaining growing the dividend as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. Turn to Slide 4, Chevron's total shareholder return outpaced our major competitors and the S&P 500 in 2016 and is number one relative to our peers for any cumulative holding period going back 20 years. We appreciate the support from our investors but recognize markets are forward-looking and expectations are high. We need to continue to deliver on our commitments and manage our advantage portfolio for growing cash flow and competitive returns. Pat will not take you through the financial results.\nPat Yarrington: Okay. Thank you, John. Turning now to Slide 5 which is an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were $415 million or $0.22 per diluted share while earnings for the full-year 2016 were a loss of $497 million. Excluding special items and foreign exchange, Chevron earned $1.8 billion in 2016. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Fourth quarter results were impacted by non-routine item and timing effects. Downstream results were weak reflecting adverse timing affect because of a rising crude price environment and an extensive turnaround at the Richmond refinery, a once in every five year event. At the same time, fourth quarter corporate charges which are known to be non-ratable were heavier than in average quarter. Our debt ratio at year was 24%. During the fourth quarter we paid $2 billion in dividends bringing our total for the year to $8 billion or $4.29 per share. 2016 was our 29th consecutive year of an annual per share increase. We currently yield 3.7%. Turning to Slide 6, cash generated from operations was $3.9 billion during the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter cash flow benefited from stronger oil prices but had offset the seasonal downstream margin patterns and the Richmond refinery turnaround. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow totaled $12.8 billion, a function of low oil and gas prices and weaker downstream margins than in 2015. 2016 working capital consumption of approximately $600 and lower affiliate dividends relative to earnings reduced operating cash. We had deferred tax items of nearly $4 billion for example those associated with tax loss positions. These will benefit cash in future periods. Proceeds from assets sales for 2016 were $2.8 billion. Cash, capital expenditures were $4 billion for the quarter and about $18 billion for the full year excluding expense expiration. This continues a trend towards lower outlays. At year end our cash and cash equivalents totaled $7 billion. Our net debt stood at $39 billion resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 21%. Turning to Slide 7. Slide seven compares 2016 annual earnings to 2015. Full year 2016 results were a loss of $497 million or approximately $5 billion lower than the 2015 results. The impact of special items primarily due to lower gains on asset sales reduced earnings by $515 million. Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by about $710 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased $798 million between periods as lower realizations were only partly offset by lower operating costs and exploration expense. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by $2.8 billion, primarily due to lower margins. Recall that 2015 downstream margins were among the strongest we\u2019ve seen in a number of years. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects higher cooperate charges and interest expense. Full year 2016 results are in line with our standing guidance of $350 million to $400 million in net charges per quarter for the other segment. Turning to Slide 8. I\u2019ll now compare results for the fourth quarter of 2016 with the third quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter sales were approximately $870 million lower than the third quarter. The absence of third quarter 2016 gains from special items reduced earnings by $290 million between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $50 million between periods. Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased approximately $850 million between quarters, primarily reflecting crude utilization, higher volumes and lower taxes. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange were lower by $765 million. This outcome was primarily driven by decreased volumes and increased operating expense, associated with the Richmond refinery turnaround, lower worldwide margins and an unfavorable swing in inventory timing effect. The variance in the other segment is largely driven by adverse tax effects and corporate charges. These impacts are non-ratable and tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. And now I'll turn it back to John.\nJohn Watson: Okay. Thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 9, 2016 capital spending was $22.4 billion, that's approximately $4 billion less than our original budget and more than $11 billion lower than last year. Cash C&E was $18.7 billion. Productions are mainly from finishing our major projects under construction, pacing and hi-grading future investment and realizing efficiency gains and supplier cost reduction. In December we announced a total capital and exploratory budget for 2017 of $19.8 million which is right in the middle of our $17 billion $22 billion guidance range for the period out to 2020. Cash, capital and exploratory expenditures, which exclude affiliate spend are expected to be $15.1 billion. 70% of our expenditures in 2017 will generate cash flow within two years, reducing cash flow cycle time and financial risk. 2016 operating expense was $25 billion better than we had most recently guided and more than $2.5 billion less than last year. We're sizing the organization to fit the work we anticipate. Our employee workforce is down $9,500 since the end of 2014. We've improved work processes and have negotiated better rates from contractors and vendors. Upstream operating expenses excluding fuel are down nearly $3 per barrel since 2014. Most significant workforce reductions are behind us, but our focus on improving efficiencies in all aspects of the business continue and we expect further progress on OpEx in 2017 and beyond. Slide 10 shows the sources of changes in production between 2015 and '16. 2016 net production was $2.6 million barrels per day. Growth continues from completing and ramping up major capital projects, our short cycle shale and base business work was excellent particularly in light of significant reductions in spending. We limited declines in mature fields by improvements in reliability and drilling work and an effective work-over program. Production was impacted by the ongoing shut in of the partitioned zone, security issues in Nigeria and Gulf of Mexico asset sales. Looking at the fourth quarter bar, you'll see the fourth quarter was strong and production growth is accelerating. As we start the year two trains at Gorgon are running near capacity. Angola LNG is operating well and the successful Agbami and TCL maintenance shutdowns are behind us. We expect production growth this year of 49% at $50 per barrel before asset sales. The uncertainty reflects variables such as the speed of major capital project ramp ups, external events such as the timing of the partitioned zone restart and ultimate base decline rates. Growth comes from a number of areas. First, we expect to see full-year production from project started up in 2016. Gorgon train one and two, Shandong Bay, Angola LNG, Alder, Bangka and we also expect to see partially a contribution for project starting up in 2017, Gorgon Train 3, Wheatstone and Mafumeria Sul for example. Shale and tight production headlined by the Permian will also show growth as we take advantage of our valuable acreage. Base declines along with full year 2017 impacts of sales consummated in 2016 will both reduce production. The impact of 2017 asset sales on the timing -- on the timing of the close of the individual transaction is one variable. Our current estimate is a reduction of 50,000 to 100,000 barrels a day. Turing to Slide 12, the chart on the left side shows our $5 billion to $10 billion guidance range for asset sale proceeds for 2016 and 2017. In 2016 we made good progress with $2.8 billion in proceeds as we sold assets for value that were not essential to delivering on strategy, didn't compete for capital, with our current opportunity set and were worth more to others than to us. Additional opportunities are in progress and many will close in 2017. We expect proceeds close to the top of the guidance range. With new assets coming online in the benefits of portfolio actions, we expect to increase cash margins. The chart on the right shows a doubling of production in the more than $25 per barrel category and a reduction in low margin barrel. Despite a sharp reduction in capital spending we have a strong reserve replacement year exceeding 100% before asset sales for the one and five-year periods. We saw significant adds from the final investment decision on TCO's future growth project. Additionally there are reserves added from improved reservoir characterization in several areas and strong well performance in shale and tight and various other locations. Lower commodity prices benefited entitlement volumes from profit-sharing and variable royalty contracts. This was partially offset by lower economic produce ability in a few assets. Asset sales resulted in a RRR reserve replacement rate slightly below 100% consistent with the expectation of 2017 asset sales impacting production we also expect an impact on 2017 reserves from the sales. Let's talk now about some of the major activity starting with Gorgon. Gorgon currently is stable with growth output of over 200,000 barrels a day and 130 million cubic feet of domestic gas output, a total of 39 cargos have been shipped 10 since the beginning of the year. Train 1 ramp up was below expectations as we work through start-up issues we've discussed previously. All learnings from Train 1 were applied to Train 2 and consequently Train 2 ramped up over 90% of capacity within a week and continues to exceed expectations. Train 3 is also expected to benefit from these learnings. Construction is complete and we're well into startup and commissioning. We expect first LNG early in the second quarter of this year. At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. All modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are on the foundations and the site is under permanent power. Ongoing hook up and commissioning of the offshore platform is the critical path activity. We're leveraging our experience from Gorgon and incorporating learnings into our ongoing activities. We expect Train 2 to start-up six to eight months following Train 1. Turning to Permian, we\u2019re making excellent progress. Last year we lowered unit development costs by 20% and lowered unit operating costs by 35% compared to 2015. We're improving recoveries and our results are validating expectations around improvements in type curves. We're currently running 10 company operated rigs and we're adding a new rig about every eight weeks. The story keeps getting better. We'll update this chart and provide much more information about our Permian operations at our Analyst Day in March. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind we actually have a very full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary and will do our best to get all of your question answered, thanks. Jonathan please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.\nPhil Gresh: Hi, good morning. I just want to start on the 2017 production guidance. If I look at that guidance maybe on an absolute volume basis at the midpoint it would be around 2.75 million barrels a day. And I know it is a little bit stale, but a couple of years ago you had talked about a 2.9 to 3.0 type of range and obviously a lot has changed from then to now. But I was hoping maybe you could help bridge some of those moving pieces between project timing, asset sales, P and Z effects and really just trying to think through ultimately after 2017 how much additional uplift to volumes there would be from projects.\nJohn Watson: Yes, it's a good question. If you go back to that time we did put out an estimate of 2.9 to 3 range and actually the results were shown - now are very consistent with a couple of exceptions. The first and obvious one is the Partitioned Zone. We were producing - we expected we'd be back up and operating and that's about 70,000 barrels a day. So that's a clear delta. The second is the effects of asset sales that we didn't anticipate at that time. If you add up what's already closed, you can get another 70,000 barrels a day pretty quickly. And so you put those two together and that's 150,000 barrels a day and that really explains it. Now as you point out, there are some other ups and downs notably, some delays in capital projects, but the flipside of that is we got benefits the shale and tight volume is growing, Jack St. Malo has performed better than we expected. We have some price, a little bit of benefit from price effects. But those about offset. So the two big items are really the partition zone and asset sales and you get kind of right back into the zone we talked about.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, got it. That is very helpful. And then the second question would just be on the longer-term CapEx budget. Looking at the bars that you gave for 2017, there's still $2 billion in there for Gorgon and Wheatstone and then another $2 billion plus it looks like just looking at the bars for projects that are outside of Tengiz. So I guess I was just wondering how you are thinking about that $17 billion to $22 billion range, especially as we look at 2018 and you potentially have a couple billion still rolling off. Are there a lot of projects in the queue that you think work in the mid-50s or how are you thinking about that now?\nJohn Watson: Yes, first, if I got back a year and you told me we would be able to get our spending, do all the work we did this year and have spending at $22.4 billion, I wouldn't have believed it. So we've made remarkable progress in bringing our cost down. I had my drilling guy in the other day and he gave me an examine, the wells we drilled in 2016 if we had had the productivity we had in 2014, we would have spent $1 billion more. So the drilling efficiencies that we have put in place and I was just in the deep water. So the efficiencies we put in place had allowed us to bring down cost. So the trend of spend is down and as you point out we have some major capital projects that are being completed. If we're still in the $50 to $55 world, you'll see us tracking at the bottom end of that range. Now we have -- we're showing a range out of 2020 that's a four-year period and so when we think out over that time period obviously a lot of things can change. Notably, I would expect that we would see an increase in unconventional spending. We talked about ramping up the Permian and I think that will be the case. We were budgeting about $2 billion this year, but you could easily see another $1 billion there. We have very little activity in the Marsalis now. I would -- we've gotten very efficient there. So we would expect better market conditions and an offtake capability there. We made good progress in the Duvernay, Argentina. So just in the shale and tight area, you could see some increases, but again that's short cycle, high return activity. Now we do have some opportunities in the portfolio that if we continue to make good progress on concepts and delineation drilling, things like Anchor and Tigris and we've highlighted Rosebank and a few others. So we have a good queue of projects, but we need to make sure that those have right economics associated with them, but all of that can comfortably fit in the range that we've talked about, but I'll just say that if where at $50 to $55, you should expect spending to go down next year. Thanks Phil.\nPhil Gresh: Thanks John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Banc of America, Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. You have normally talked about the base business and the tight unconventional business kind of in the same breath as one offsetting the declines in the other. So I guess my first question is, in the context of declining rates and maintenance spending, your budget this year puts that number about $8.5 billion. Is that how we should interpret Chevron's definition of maintenance CapEx on a go forward basis? At least for the portfolio as it stands today?\nJohn Watson: Yes, I think that if I understand the question, we've been trying to isolate the shale from the other base business activity, just because it's such a high profile activity. The fundamental nature of it has a lot of similarities with base business in the sense that it's relatively short cycle activity and it has to compete for capital with for example infill drilling in Bakersfield or Thailand or places like that. So I think that's the right way to look at it and that's why we talked about declines in the 2% to 3% range and despite the big drop in capital, we were able to maintain that sort of a decline rate, but I think that's the right way to look at it and I think we'll generally separate the shale from the base business, so that you have transparency in that way because you're right, when you put them both together you know if you lump them together it will mask what's going on in the underlying sort of conventional business. So if I understand your question right, I think the answer is yes.\nDoug Leggate: Okay, I appreciate that, John. That is what I was trying to get at. I guess my follow up is also in the Permian. I realize you probably want to hold some details for the Analyst Day, but just to kind of frame this. So Exxon has done the [BotCO] [ph] deal, they are talking about going to 15 rigs; my understanding is it's a fraction of that number today. You are talking about adding a rig every eight weeks, stepping up your spending and so on. Can you give us some idea, John, what is the strategic thinking here? Is there a real pivot away from large capital projects at least in the short term to work with Permian? And if that's the case, how big a piece of the portfolio would you like to see the Permian ultimately represent given things like dividend commitments and other portfolio decisions that you have? And I will leave it there. Thanks.\nJohn Watson: As told on Slide 15, we haven't updated since the last time we talked but we will update it, the next time that we see and if you - if my foreshadowing was any good, you know that it's likely to improve. So we have taken a different approach than some on the Permian. We've taken the approach of trying to delineate understand what we have and then put together plans that consider off-take, consider infrastructure and really get lined out so that we can steadily grow over the period consistent with generating good returns in this business. Now we told we've been able to bring our cost down but we will continue to ramp up. We talked about over next couple years getting up to 20 rigs but we're not limited per se, we're only limited by the good planning that we can do, the planning on infrastructure around a rig contracts, the quality of crude, frac spreads and other aspects of this so that we can move forward rapidly and we\u2019ll continue to do that. It's kind of interesting, we hear a lot about how rapidly others done but the facts are we only have five non-operated rigs running at the end of the year and we've been steadily going during the year and so there's a lot of up and down that other operators put in place. We want to do as we add rigs we want those rigs to be in service to us going forward we want to steady ramp up and not whipsawing our organization around. And so you'll see it steadily growing and I've told my group in the Permian that they are not capital limited, they just need to be sure that they are disciplined about their spend, that we get good returns on it, and that we properly evaluate the acreage. Just want to anecdote for you, the kind of getting the efficiency argument that might be of interest. We added to our resource base 500 million barrels this year in the Permian without spending any money. And we did that by watching what offset operators have done. So obviously these are continuous plays we were able - so we have been able to learn by being a little bit behind others we have been able to learn and that's help us to prioritize the stand that we're doing. So we will prosecute our agenda, you'll see the potential on growth profile rise. In an overall sense it wouldn't surprise me to see our unconventional activity be 25% of our production by the middle of the next decade. So this is a really solid asset class but it's one it's going to be driven by our ability to generate good returns and fit the proper role in the portfolio.\nDoug Leggate: Appreciate the answer. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, John, Pat, Frank. There has been some investor questions about Gorgon and Wheatstone timing especially with some of the choppiness around Train 1 in the fourth quarter. But it sounds like your messages, you think everything is tracking well here. Can you give us an up to date on what the confidence level is around construction execution at the assets and what the greatest risk to timing at Gorgon and Wheatstone ramp is?\nFrank Mount: Well Gorgon is done I guess would be the way I would describe the construction is completed on Train 3, Train 1 and 2 are operating near capacity in fact - the only remaining thing to do is to bring on the Gorgon offshore field. We've been running on the Jansz field and so we will fill out those plans 100% when the Gorgon field comes online shortly. So in terms of construction activity at Gorgon all is good. Now we do have - we do have to have an effective startup and commissioning process and we had some bumps on train one. We talked about that before, but I've been really pleased that the organization has taken all that in and addressed anything that might from that those learnings on train two and on train three. It's obviously been very effective on train two and I've got no reason to believe it won't be effective on train three, but a strong startup in commissioning is really key for Gorgon but my subtlety in my comments was we expect LNG early in the second quarter. So I think the story of Gorgon is a good one. At Wheatstone we're making good progress, certainly at the plant and I think the comment I made is the critical path activity is the offshore platform. Now the well worth subsea flowlines, pipelines umbilical, all that is complete. Train one construction is nearing completion and commission is underway and so the critical path activity is in some of the platform piping systems. They\u2019ve taken a little longer to complete and be commissioned. We've supplemented our workforce on the platform, but it hasn\u2019t changed our expectation of a midyear start date. But it's just the ongoing activity and ebb and flow in the construction work, but the plan is still for midyear startup of that plant, but the message I'm trying to give you is it's pretty good and as activity winds down, you can really focus on the work faces that are still open, high grading crews and so I expect you'll continue to see a good story coming out of this but it's obviously a little bit earlier in the process, so there's more work to do on Gorgon, but it's also progressing well.\nNeil Mehta: And shifting to policy, there is obviously a lot of changes under this new administration. One of the things that's caught a lot of investor attention is the border tax adjustment. John, what is your view on whether that is good policy and whether that has a meaningful impact on global oil prices in the refining business if it goes through.\nJohn Watson: Well Neil, I've seen what you published and others and I think you've assessed it reasonably well. Let me make a couple of comments. First, in an overall sense I've been very pleased with the agenda that the Trump administration has. We've seen an avalanche of regulation over the last decade and putting a much, much more balanced cost-benefit framework in place to assess the value of those regulations freeing up infrastructure pipeline, all of that is quite positive for our business for the country job creation and a lot of things. So that is very much a positive and we all know that our tax system is not competitive. We want American companies to be able to compete and so there's a lot of work being done to try to bring down corporate rates so that we can compete both at home and abroad for capital and of course menstruation has a focus on bringing jobs and capital back to the U.S. and lower rate will help that. In my view, they're looking for pay-for, they're looking for ways to make those always happen and so they're looking at a variety of different concepts and the truth is, there are a lot of different ideas being floated right now and I think they're looking for input and we'll continue to provide it. President Trump has indicated that the border adjustment concept is complex and I would agree with that. And so I think we need to take a close look at perhaps the consequences of that both some of them could be positive and the unintended consequences in terms of impact on consumers, exchange rates and knock on effects on the global economy and I have no doubt that the anticipation will do a good job of doing that and will settle on the right kind of tax reform at the end of the day. But I think we need to have a little patience for the different ideas that are being put out there and hopefully we'll get to the right outcome. Thanks Neil.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nPaul Sankey: Good morning, everyone. John, could you talk about OPEC this year and the impacts that you anticipate? My understanding was that Partitioned neutral Zone would be part of the cuts. But also I would be interested if you had observations on some of your other areas of exposure. And a couple of the more obscure ones would be obviously Venezuela and whether or not -- exactly where you are at in Nigeria right now. Thank you.\nJohn Watson: Sure. The short answer is I don't expect a significant impact from any of these things on our operations, certainly in Venezuela and Nigeria indications are they been operating at lower rates and we've had no indication that we're going to be impacted. When I look at the Partitioned Zone, and you look at the public comments that have been made by Kuwait, they have a strong desire to get the onshore Partitioned Zone where we - where that Saudis and Kuwaitis are partners and we represent the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have a strong desire to get that online and they have indicated that it won't have an impact on quarters. So to me the issues are between the two governments and if they can resolve those, we will be able to bring it back up and I think both countries have flexibility in terms of which fields they produce and where that volume will come from. We think those are high margin barrels when they come online. I mean if you look at the work during this time and we've been down there, our people have taken the time to dramatically reduce costs and they have taken a close look at the reservoir and we've got a queue of base business activity that is very high return, it will compete with the best we've got in the world and it's very economic. So I think the Kuwaitis understand that. And I think there's a desire to move it back to get it back on production but look this is - these are issues between governments, I'm not going to give you a forecast of when that might be resolved.\nPaul Sankey: Right, but on balance you are expecting little impact from OPEC. My follow up is on decline rates. John, you have talked in the past a lot about them. Have you been surprised by how little global oil supply has declined post 2014? But do you anticipate an acceleration in declines? Thank you.\nJohn Watson: It\u2019s a really good question Paul. I think the shorter answer is, I have been surprised at how resilient production has been in many locations around the world some of that is we just keep getting better. If you look at for example some of the Deepwater developments that we and others have, we've been on plateau at Agbami for a long time, we\u2019ve been in plateau in some of our Gulf of Mexico projects and I think we and others are getting very good at extending plateaus and technology only goes in one direction. We hear about in the context of the shale but the same thing is true in other conventional activity. So I think the short answer is, I have been little surprised and with the benefit from - for example in Russia from declining exchange rates and things of that sort, it's made some of that base activity more competitive. Ultimately however you do need new major capital projects to fill the gap if you look out a few years and we are not just seeing FID's been taken on significant new Greenfield opportunities and so at some point we do need - we do expect to see at least in the conventional area some declines in production and there is a limit to this and it has surprised us that it's held up as well as it has, but at some point you're going to need new activity.\nPaul Sankey: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.\nJason Gammel: John, I wanted to come back to the comment you made about 70% of capital spend having an effect on production within two years. Now I assume part of that is still spending on major capital projects that start in that time. But, nevertheless, it does illustrate how much you are shifting towards short cycle spend. And really the question is how has this changed how you manage the risk profile of the Company on a move forward basis? Thinking really about how you view uncertainty of earnings from the production profile by not having the big step changes necessarily being as impactful? And how you think about the balance sheet without having those big capital commitments?\nJohn Watson: I think it's true. There are - there are different kinds of risk when you think about it Deepwater development versus some of the base business activity or some of the shale development and so we're cognizant of that and I think that driven some of the comments you heard me and Pat make about how we look at the balance sheet. During the period of time in the early part of this decade, I was very clear going back to five years plus. We were heading into a period where we had significant major capital projects, we were going to keep some capacity on the balance sheet and so we had more cash than debt on the balance sheet. And so because we knew we were going to be drawing on that - drawing on the balance sheet. Now we didn\u2019t expect to see the drop in prices as big as we saw but it proved to be pretty wise to keep that capacity on the balance sheet. Now we're on a different period. We do have the Tengiz project but I don't see the same anything like Gorgon, Wheatstone or Tengiz in our future. We could see a deepwater development but none of these are of that same magnitude and with the drop in interest rates that we've seen during that period, debt is a very effective form of financing. And so we want to keep some capacity on the balance sheet to withstand the ups and downs in and be in a good position to take advantage of opportunities, but you I think you'll see us carrying more debt on the balance sheet than we have in the past. We've talked in the 20% to 25% debt range and we think that balance is keeping some capacity and taken advantage of the low cost of debt. The key for us is having some financial flexibility around our capital spending that really reduces the execution risk and means you don't have to keep that as much capacity on the balance sheet.\nJason Gammel: Can I ask one follow up, please?\nJohn Watson: Sure.\nJason Gammel: Okay. I just wanted to -- I have two quick questions about what is included in the production guidance. If I look at the chart on page 10, if I take the net of the base decline and the base investment, it implies a mitigated decline rate of 1%. Could you tell me what factors into the guidance range and then also how the Partitioned Zone factors into the 4% to 9% guidance range.\nJohn Watson: Sure. I think if I understand the question, the base decline that we show by the red bar are kind of in the 2% to 3% range and we do have a range, the bottom of the production range in our estimate that we put forward, assumes that we get nothing from the Partitioned Zone this year. The top of the range assume it starts up about midyear or so. So those are the two variables and that's why we put the fuzzy bar and some brackets around it because I just can't -- I just can't handicap that perfectly, but the base decline is that 2% to 3% range.\nJason Gammel: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please?\nPaul Cheng: Hey guys. Good morning. John, if we look at the industry it seems like you already bottom and the Company is in good shape, that projects are coming on stream and you should reach cash flow neutral not and it depends on the projects should be cash flow positive. So can we -- using this opportunity that you're already resizing your company also for this -- currently the lower oil prices. So, can we step a step back and maybe that you can tell us that how the next 5, 10 years how you want to position? What are the roadmaps that you have in mind? How do you want to differentiate yourself with the peers and the other international major corporations? Is it that everyone is now saying that oh I mean there is no differentiation, we're in commodity business and the big major IOC is really in a disadvantage on the business model? So, can you help us that to wrap it altogether now that you no longer -- not you necessarily, but for most other people that no longer is in the mode of survival, can we look a little bit further out, now can you afford that business to look at it and saying that give us what is the roadmap?\nJohn Watson: Sure. Well Paul look, it won't surprise you that I don't agree with some of those assessments. I think we're in a terrific position and some of the TSR data that we show even looking at independence over a period of time we look pretty good and I would say that we are differentiated from some of our competitors and let me see if I can describe why. We aren't integrated oil and gas company and we have shown a bias toward the upstream portfolio. We think over time, we can earn very strong returns and that we have competitive technology and assets to do just that. We do have a strong downstream and chemical business. It earns good returns. It has complementary activity that add value to some of our resources around the world as well as a lot of very talented people. So we will have a downstream and chemical business, but certainly we will be predominantly an upstream company and that in and of itself is a bit of a difference from some of our competitors. Within the upstream, I think we also differentiate ourselves by the quality of the assets that we have. There are risks to being a company that's only in one particular asset play regardless of how good that play is. We got a diverse portfolio for example if you look at our position in Australia, the resource base we have there will have five LNG trains plus a position in a six that's or a third project down there in the Northwest shelf. We have a very advantage manufacturing position and a lot of resource that can feed those facilities over time. So Australia is a terrific asset. Tengiz we have talked about. That distinguishes us from many of our competitors and the Permian is of course the emerging asset and we got a terrific position there that I think is the envy of a lot of others and you will see - you are seeing us and you'll see us in the future really get after that business. And I haven't even talked about the talent we have and the asset position we got in the deepwater and elsewhere. So we have a very good portfolio that I wouldn't trade with anybody and I think over time the diversity in that portfolio will show benefits and anyone asset has some risk associated with it from an industry perspective and I think we've got a position that second to none. Now our approach is going forward is to - we know we have to improve returns because in a lower price environment the financial returns haven't been what you and I would want them to be but if you look at the cost trends and efficiency trends we've got and - where we\u2019re putting on capital going forward as capital base roles over I think we've got some very strong assets so that going forward the assets that we got the investments that we\u2019ll able to make will earn good return. So I think all of those things distinguish us in what is - from a topline point of view a difficult time that we're emerging from and one that will not likely be the same $100 environment that that we saw a few years ago, maybe that's a long answer.\nPaul Cheng: Really great. Just a quick second one, Venezuela. Any insight to how bad is the industry - oil industry in the country at this point? And do you think that any systematic risk is likely? Or that if not, then do you think that the current production capacity actually will be able to hold relatively flat or will you going to continue to see this decline for the year?\nFrank Mount: Well for the most part I\u2019m going to comment on our operations and we've been able to navigate pretty well down there have good relationships in Venezuela but we've been able to maintain and we have a structure in place that is enabling us to continue work, enabling us to continue to invest and enabling importantly to enable the contractors, the tax authorities and ourselves to get paid. And so that seems to be working very well. What I point out is despite the - obviously the concerns about what's happening in the country right now and some difficulties there encountering, they have a huge resource base and Chevron is well respected there and I think there's an opportunity for us to play a very constructive role in Venezuela going forward certainly maintaining the existing assets that we have and potentially as time goes forward participating in other opportunities there but it's unquestionably difficult time thus far we've been able to manage it working well with the government.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\nEd Westlake: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the margin improvement chart into 2017, that was very helpful. Obviously as you shift to short cycle and Permian you probably also get, plus with deflation, some benefits on the capital intensity side as well, which should lead, as you pointed out, to returns and free cash flow. You spoke about debt balances, but what about growth say over the next decade versus dividends, buybacks? I mean any philosophical changes there?\nJohn Watson: There aren't changes philosophically, but let me make a couple of comments because I am encouraged - you touched on cash flow, I am very encouraged by what I see going forward on cash flow. If you look at 2016 cash from operations in the 13 billion range but it's easy to see big chunks of improving in cash flow going forward. Capital spending, the cash C&E was 18.7 last year with 15.1 that's 3.5. Oil averaged $44 a barrel if it averages 55 our sensitivity is you know that that's another $3.5 billion. We made a capital contribution to TCO technically alone for $2 billion last year and didn't receive a dividend of consequence last year. So you could see another $3 million swing net out of TCO and that doesn't even count the Gorgon and Wheatstone. The fourth quarter had a once in five years shutdown of Richmond refinery that probably cost us $3 million. We had Agbami down for once in eight years that's a very profitable investment. We had record production at TCO last year despite one of the biggest shutdowns they've ever had that was done successfully. All these things are portending strong cash flow with the \u2013 obviously the underlying risk will have to be considered in price, but certainly the message going forward is good. So the prospect for us to improve earnings, improve free cash flow and increase the dividends are good and the priorities that you referred to really haven't changed. We want to increase the dividend as a pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. We need to continue to invest in the highest return opportunities and we are definitely high grading that, not funding everything that meets minimum hurdle rates and we need to do that and manage the balance sheet at the same time and it's something that Pat works very hard on and dividend policy ultimately is a purview of the Board but in speaking for them we just reviewed what our plans are going forward. I think we have a very good support for the Board from the full Board on this subject. So I think the outlook is good and I'll tell you four years ago I wouldn't have thought that would be the case at moderate prices. So I think it's a good story and we\u2019re going to continue in that direction.\nEd Westlake: And then maybe a follow-up on the question on decline you spoke more globally. But as you think about the Chevron assets and the ability to keep the decline rate, [Atwater] [ph] has been a relatively low level over the past year. I mean, how long do you think that you can keep that up? I mean the Tengiz decline rate when that was announced did surprise a few folks. And so I am just wondering if there is any things that we should be concerned about as we forecast out over the next several years.\nJohn Watson: There's always a requirement to reinvest in the business. In the case of Tengiz, it\u2019s a technically complex field and so those needed pressure management equipment and we have to make those investments. That's very different from say Bakersfield California where there's infill drilling that you need to do but it's a pretty well understood phenomena. If you invest a certain amount of capital you can manage the decline. So I don't have the real \u2013 when we were early last year we were down around $30 a barrel and we weren\u2019t investing in the business and really we were cutting back activity in lots of areas. There was the potential for declines to accelerate because we just weren't drilling wells and we were I think it was very difficult time for everyone in the industry. But if we get back to a more normal level of activity you can see sort to 2% to 4% kind of declines that I think would be normal and the individual asset ultimately matures but -- I don\u2019t think I can give you a lot more general guidance than that.\nFrank Mount: Thanks Ed.\nEd Westlake: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nEvan Calio: Yes, good morning. John, you should tweet your US policy and BAT response later. My question is on, you mentioned the Permian story keeps getting better with an ambitious 25% production potential in the middle of next decade. I mean as much as border tax, I think investors remain focused on service cost inflation here in the US. So any color or outlook there and how much inflation would it trigger -- would it take, sorry -- to trigger a capital reallocation away from the Delaware in your plan? Or how do you offset there as they maybe relate to continuing improvement in well performance and otherwise?\nJohn Watson: Yes, Evan, boy, that\u2019s a topic that gets a lot of attention and my view is I think if you look globally, there isn\u2019t a lot of pressure on the supply chain. I don\u2019t expect continuing reductions necessarily in market conditions. But there isn\u2019t a lot of upside pressure globally. In the Permian, activity has picked up and going forward we would expect to see some pressure but if you look at the dramatic reductions in cost that we've been able to achieve it's been mostly a function of efficiency measures that we think are sustainable. One of the reasons I made the comments I did earlier bouts about steady ramp up of rigs and having sort of a consistent and well thought through plan is it will be important to have consistency in workers for example. Not all rigs are the same so you want to have the best rigs, you want to have the best crews, you want to have consistent relationships with suppliers who want to be with you through thick and thin so that you can have that maintain that productivity that we\u2019ve worked so hard to put in place. Our view is despite some increases, potential for increases, we don't think it's going to make a material difference to us over the next couple of years and I\u2019ll confide it to that period, but we don't think it\u2019s going to make a big difference even if you should see some changes. I should also point out in areas like the deepwater our costs are going to come down because we've got deepwater rigs that are under contract at above market rates. We're going to be releasing a couple of rigs here literally over the next couple of weeks so we\u2019ll be down to four deepwater rigs. But over time all these rigs come off contracts and so when you think about the future of a deepwater development, the costs are coming down not going up. So there's some risk in isolated markets in areas but I think overall we\u2019ll be able to manage it.\nEvan Calio: No, we kind of agree Permian is a winner here. But my follow up is on the Permian and how big is your 2017 program either in rig or well terms? I'm just trying to understand how much of the 2017 CapEx is being spent on infrastructure, pad development or otherwise that is reflected in 2018 and beyond. It affects -- it would affect the model growth path.\nJohn Watson: We ended the year at 15 rigs, 10 operated, 5 non-operated and we\u2019re going to be ramping up over the course of this year, we expect up to 15 rigs operated by the end of the year with more on the non-operated side. We've got - our budget is about $2 billion there and look we expect to ramp up this year in the $50 to $60 range. We're going to continue to ramp up and I just want to say we want to do it efficiently.\nFrank Mount: Thanks Evan.\nEvan Calio: I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please.\nAlastair Syme: John, global LNG demand looked to have picked up a bit last year. Can you comment on the state of the market? And are you seeing any positive signs from your customers towards a willingness to turn new contracts in the market?\nJohn Watson: Yes, it\u2019s been interesting and it's been maybe a little surprising to some. We've had good demand for LNG. We were able to sign a couple of contracts last year. So that now Gorgon and Wheatstone sort of 85% maybe slightly more sold which is right about where we want to be. And if you look at where spot pricing have been it\u2019s clear that there's been incremental cargos going into China and Japan. So it's been somewhat encouraging I think and if you look at some of the environmental objectives they are particularly throughout Asia, it\u2019s actually some encouraging signs. Now I temper that with the understanding that we\u2019ve got projects that are coming online but the long-term trend for LNG demand is good because it's competitive on price in many locations and it certainly has desirable environmental characteristics and the security of that steady supply out of places like Australia it remains in demand. So by 2025 or so people are looking at demand increases that could be 65% or more. So it's a good story. I don't think we\u2019re yet at the place where you're going to see a lot of FID is taken on new projects but it's been encouraging to see a bump up in prices.\nAlastair Syme: As a follow-up John, are you having any sort of indicative marketing discussions around the Gorgon Train 4 or Kitimat or any of these projects?\nJohn Watson: Well we've had discussions over the years. I would say the most likely - you need to underpin a project like Kitimat with some type of contract and off take and I don\u2019t want to represent that we're very far along in those discussions. We\u2019ve been looking at different concepts for an LNG plant to be able to put one in more efficiently. We\u2019re proving up the resource side which is encouraging up in the Liard and Horn River area and of course we've done some work on pipeline. But I don\u2019t want to advertise, that's moving real quickly primarily because of the economic side. When it comes to Gorgon, I think the first thing that you\u2019ll see at Gorgon is first we got the three trains lined down and operating smoothly and I think that will happen then you'll see the potential for debottlenecking and re-rating of those. And I think those are probably in the queue, certainly in the queue ahead of a Train 4 or other trains at Wheatstone for that matter where the same sort of principles will apply. We want to really get the most we can out of the year and hardware that we have and then contingent on market. We have a strong resource base there. We\u2019ll contemplate additional development.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Hello, good morning. I guess a quick question for you, Pat, just to come back to the comment about the -- kind of the other expense in the quarter. You said it wasn't ratable. Was there anything in there that is likely to reverse next year or that you can think of that we should expect next year in terms of higher taxes or unusual payments\nPat Yarrington: Yes. So I think it\u2019s a good question. I wouldn\u2019t say that there is anything necessarily that\u2019s going to reverse. An example that you might not have thought of, when we have as many retirements as we have had for example, out of the U.S. John referenced, over the current year we have 5,200 pure employees this year and over the last couple of years it\u2019s about 9,500. For example, if you look at the U.S. we're slightly under funded on our pension and now those retirements occurs and of course you need to accelerate the recognition of that pension settlement cost. So, that\u2019s an example of what's sitting there in that corporate and other sector. And since we anticipate moderating, certainly we\u2019re not going to have the same kind of employee reduction, that kind of thing will moderate going forward. There is a fair amount of lumpiness just on a tax sense, where we continually every quarter go through and make assessments of our outstanding positions and make the appropriate bookings that are required there and I can\u2019t say that there is any pattern to that necessarily. As you look forward into 2017 though. I would say the one thing that probably is going to continue to grow would be our interest expense. Because our debt balances are higher. So we have had a guidance range of the $350 million to $400 million is probably towards the high end of that range probably you want to think in your mind around $400 million for each quarter for 2017.\nRoger Read: Okay, great, thanks. And then, John, maybe following up on Alastair's question but stepping out a little broader on FIDs. Is there, and I recognized the Analyst Day, that it might be more detailed coming then. But as you think about kind of moving into the offshore, are costs down enough now, are prices high enough and the returns attractive enough we should expect something in 2017? Or is it still maybe more patience and waiting\nJohn Watson: I think most of the money that we'll be spending in fact the four deep water rigs I mentioned will be developing drilling. I think it\u2019s a bit early to think about FID on something on Anchor and Tigris. We\u2019re just completing a couple of appraisal well if you will. We need to evaluate those. We're looking a different concepts for example in the deepwater there is technology that needs to be qualified there to be sure that it move them along we got industry groups that are working with vendors and suppliers to try to take cost out so I would say its work-in-progress, there is plenty of work to do that I would call brownfield activity you know off of existing facilities and so that\u2019s where most of the money will be spend. We talk previously about Rosebank and I would just tell you Rosebank, Anchor, Tigris, all are potential FIDs but we just have to get the cost resource development balance right and so I wouldn\u2019t think any of those big ones where we likely to see and FID in 2017.\nRoger Read: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber from Simmons and Company. Your question please.\nGuy Baber: Good morning everybody. I just wanted to follow up on the cash margin discussion a little bit more and slide 12 where you highlight that improvement. But you introduced a slide I believe around a year ago that highlighted cash margins in 2017 at about $20 a barrel at $60 a barrel oil. But since then over the last year I believe your cost reductions have been more successful than anticipated, some lower margin barrels have come out at the portfolio and the Permian is looking better. So, can you just help us to understand how your view on those 2017 cash margins has maybe evolved over the last year or so? And is it reasonable for us to think that those margins could be higher at the same price.\nJohn Watson: Yes, we put this chart in thereto kind abate you a little bit and to watch your appetite and I think we successfully did that and I think all the things you point to are or what we were trying to get at. I am going to push off a little bit though and tell you that Jay Johnson will talk more about what we see in cash margins in our portfolio. With the cost improvements you are seeing the place of portfolio actions that we're taking, we'll update you little bit more to SAM guys. It's a really good question and I think it's one of our strengths and one of our good stories. But I'll push off to the SAM in five weeks or so.\nGuy Baber: Okay, understood. And then the follow up for me, I thought your reserve additions and the replacement metrics were pretty favorable overall in light of the environment. Could you perhaps share with us the early view on F&D costs this year? And then given F&D can be lumpy in any year and the cost deflation you have seen, your shift to prioritizing short cycle brownfield, do you have a view on maybe the new normal of F&D for your business going forward to 2020?\nJohn Watson: Well I agree with you that the reserve replacement numbers are pretty good, I'll tell you, if I go back to beginning of the year we weren't expecting to be near 100%, so a lot of the work that the people on our business units did, we got them focused on shorter cycle activity and it's an excellent work in terms of characterizing reservoir seismic work and others to enable us to appropriately book reserve. So you're right, we had a good year and particularly given that we understand dramatically relative to plan. So all that is - all that is good. F&D cost if you think the oil and gas disclosure can be really lumpy and you really have to look at and averaging over time. We've tended to give you development cost on a project-by-project basis. It doesn't always line up exactly with - the proved reserves bookings that tend to be how things are viewed in the oil and gas disclosure. So I won't make comments on what will appear on the oil and gas disclosure because that's a very specific set of calculations. But I think as we look forward to the security announcement we are going to have in a few weeks, I think Jay will be able to talk a little bit more about progress in the Permian and what we're seeing in some of our - what we're doing on deepwater and other asset classes to give you better idea of what development cost for any of those might be. So, we'll give you more. It's a real good question, but we need more time to talk about when I got here today.\nGuy Baber: Understood. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Your question please.\nAnish Kapadia: Thank you. My first question is - correct me if I am wrong, but Chevron seems like it will be free cash flow positive in 2017 after dividends around current oil prices. And then if you factor in disposals certainly at the top end of the range, you are going to generate some significant excess cash flow. So I was wondering if you could talk about the priorities for the use of that excess cash flow this year.\nJohn Watson: Well, sure the expectation is to be cash flow positive with between all those things you mentioned, the ongoing improvement, finishing capital projects, lower spending, some assets sale proceeds et cetera. We do expect to be cash-flow positive. The priority on the dividend is that we said we'll increase the dividend as a pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. So we'll take stock of it, the board take stock of it. Every quarter we make a look and we'll increase it as we find appropriate. I guess the one point I'm trying to make is we're very cognizant that we've increased the dividend 29 years in a row and I view that any increase in the dividend would be something I want to be able to sustain in perpetuity. So going in that would be my expectation. So we always want to increase the dividend in a way that we can sustain over a period of time. So we will - we've given you the guidance on capital, I don't expect us to exceed the capital numbers that we have certainly. We are cognizant of the dividend policy and we are going to maintain the strong balance sheet. But I am not going to give you a specific guidance on the dividend at this time other than to say I am acutely aware of how much we all like dividends and so is the board.\nAnish Kapadia: Thank you. And a follow up going back to the Permian again. Just to kind of think of it bigger picture. I was just wondering how important is it for you -- is it to you for the market to recognize the value of your Permian acreage? And if it is important how do you get the market to recognize that? And I am kind of thinking of it in the terms of you can easily bring value forward by running a lot more rigs on the acreage or disposing of some of your acreage that I suppose you -- given the huge inventory you might not be drilling for 20, 30 years. So just how do you balance managing the asset versus kind of showing the value to the market?\nJohn Watson: It\u2019s very important for us to have value realized in a reasonable period of time. And there is no intention to warehouse acreage that we are not to going to get to. In fact, if you look at the asset disposal we have, we've been high grading our portfolio very steadily. What I don't want to do, is dispose a acreage prematurely before we've been able to assess it fully. If we have followed what some wanted us to do, we would have sold things a couple of years ago that are now worth five times what they are. So we continue to assess it. If we find that there is acreage in the portfolio that we\u2019re not going to get to for a long period of time, I am more than happy to monetize it. But that is not the way we think that we can realize most value. And I will just make a minor editorial comment. There are lot of people with ulterior motives out there when it comes to disposal of assets and we are prosecuting our agenda across our competitive and we will utilize our acreage and expose that value to shareholders in a way that will give them confidence that value will be realized from it. That is and we recognize that we do continue to get more information and provide that so that you have that confidence. So, it's a very fair question and it\u2019s on us to do that and you\u2019ll see a lot more in March.\nAnish Kapadia: Okay. Very clear, thank you\nJohn Watson: I think we have one more question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please.\nBlake Fernandez: Thanks for squeezing me in. Back on the deepwater, Roger's question, Mad Dog was noticeably absent and your partner and the operator has announced sanctioning there. Unless I missed it I don't believe we have heard from Chevron. So you can talk about that and whether that's in the 2017 budget.\nJohn Watson: Yes, in a word, it is.\nBlake Fernandez: Okay.\nJohn Watson: We have a relatively small interest. We're not the operator, but yes, we work with the operator. We\u2019ve been able to get cost down. They\u2019ve taken FID. We have not yet taken FID, but I expect that we will.\nBlake Fernandez: Great. Okay. And the second question, Pat, this may be for you. But you mentioned about $4 billion of deferred tax. And I assume that that begins to be a net positive once the US Upstream is net income positive, which it was this quarter. So is it fair to think that that is kind of a cash contributor into next year or this year I should say?\nPat Yarrington: I think it will be a cash contributor a partial cash contributor in 2017, yes. Because we have the ability in the U.S. to take some the tax losses and carry them back to earlier periods where we have taxable income. And depending upon what happens to prices and how we operate U.S. both upstream and downstream, we will get a schedule of repayments over time.\nBlake Fernandez: Thank you very much.\nFrank Mount: Okay. We went a little longer. I wanted to get as many of you in as I could. Thank you for your time today. We appreciate your interest in the company. We look forward to talking you again in March and until then, we\u2019ll continue to prosecute our agenda. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-10-29 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay, thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Bruce Niemeyer, Vice President Mid-Continent Business Unit; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I'll begin with a recap of our third quarter 2016 financial and operational results, and then Bruce will provide an update on our Permian Basin business prior to my concluding remarks. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $1.3 billion or $0.68 per diluted share. Third quarter results included $290 million and special items related to a deferred tax benefit from the U.K. tax rate change and the receipt of an Ecuador arbitration award. Excluding these special items, as well as the positive impact from foreign exchange effects of $72 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $921 million or $0.49 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the Appendix to this presentation. Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.3 billion and our debt ratio at quarter end was 23.7%. Our net debt ratio was approximately 20%. During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividend. Earlier in the week we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.08 per share payable to stockholders of record as of November 18, 2016. Our annual per share payout for 2016 will be $4.29 per share and represents the 29th consecutive year of growth in the annual per share payout. We currently yield 4.3%. Turning to Slide 4, cash generated from operations was $5.3 billion during the third quarter and $9 billion year-to-date. Year-to-date working capital effects of $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion in deferred tax items; for example, those associated with tax loss positions reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are timing effects. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $800 million in the third quarter including the sale of selected Gulf of Mexico assets. These transactions had a minimal impact on earnings in the quarter. Year-to-date asset sale proceeds are $2.2 billion. We continue to pursue a number of potential transactions and we remain confident that we can achieve our $5 billion to $10 billion for total proceeds over this year and next. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.1 billion, a decrease of $2.7 billion from the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date cash investment outlays have totaled approximately $14 billion. During the quarter, we advanced $2 billion to Tengizchevroil or TCO in support of the FGP project. This outflow is reflected in our cash flow statement as a borrowing by equity affiliates. The first co-lending tranche provides sufficient funding as the project commences. Future advances are expected and the timing will be dependent upon oil prices, TCO's internal cash generation, and the project pace of investment. At quarter-end, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled approximately $7.7 billion and our net debt position was $37.9 billion. Turning now to Slide 5; Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2016 results were $754 million, lower than third quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the deferred tax benefit related to the U.K. tax rate change, the award of an Ecuador arbitration claim, and the absence of third quarter 2015 assets impairments increased earnings by $535 million between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by $322 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange were largely flat between quarters as lower crude realizations were offset by lower operating expenses and favorable tax impacts. Downstream results, excluding special items and FX decreased by $1 billion, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins and lower earnings from CP Chem. Turning now to Slide 6; here I'll compare results for the third quarter of 2016 with the second quarter of 2016. Third quarter results were approximately $2.8 billion higher than the second quarter. The absence of second quarter 2016 charges associated with special items, and the inclusion of third quarter gains from special items increased earnings by $2.7 billion between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $200 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange were comparable between quarters, in line with relatively flat rent prices. Lower operational expenses offset essentially by lower listings and adverse tax impacts. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange were higher by $255 million, primarily resulting from the absence of unfavorable second quarter inventory valuation effects. Prices were generally rising during the second quarter but relatively flat during the third quarter. Turning to Slide 7; here we compare the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter of 2016 and third quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 26,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 77,000 barrels a day as ramp ups continued at Gorgon Jack / St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG. About half of this bar is Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, with all shale and tight basins reflecting year-on-year growth. More than half of this bar is Permian production. Our base business decline was 66,000 barrels per day. Production from new wells and other Brownfield investments in the base added 39,000 barrels per day and helped hold the overall basic decline rate to less than 2%. The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 47,000 barrels per day. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 27,000 barrels per day, mainly due to security issues in Nigeria. Our planned turnaround activity was heavier than this time last year resulting in a decrease of 26,000 barrels per day, the most significant of which was the TCO as we completed the turnaround of the second generation plant. Based on nine months of actuals and our forecast for the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year 2016 production will be approximately 2.6 million barrels per day. Turning now to Slide 8; as we indicated on the second quarter call, we expect to exit the year with December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day or growth in the range of 150,000 barrels per day from the third quarter average. A major contributor as previously discussed is TCO's return to production on September 9 following the largest planned turnaround in its history, ahead of schedule, under budget, and without serious incidents or injuries. Over the course of six weeks, maintenance was conducted on more than 500 pieces of equipment. At its peak, over 8,800 employees and contractors were onsite for the turnaround. The team work proactively with over 30 contract companies on all stages of planning, preparation, and execution. This was a large undertaking that was exceptionally well executed. The second contributor to volume growth in December is the ramp up of our LNG projects, notably Gorgon. At Gorgon Train 1 production is stable, and Train 2 is now online. At Angola LNG, the plant reached a rate of approximately 5 million tons per year of LNG. Production has been suspended while minor modifications to reach full capacity are completed. Short duration shutdowns are often experienced as facilities ramped up to their full capacity. ALNG expects to restart the plant within the next couple of weeks and will continue to ramp up and fine tune the system. Since the initial restart earlier this year, they have shipped 8 LNG cargos and 16 LPG cargos. In addition to LNG volume increases, we achieved first production from Bangka in August, and expect first production from Alder before year-end. We also expect continued growth in our unconventional and from our base business investments. Turning now to Slide 9; at Gorgon, total Train 1 LNG production has been stable at an average rate of 110,000 barrels per day which is about 5 million tons per year. We are also producing about 6,700 barrels per day of condensates. As mentioned, Train 2 is running and producing LNG. Production is expected to ramp up over the coming months. We have shipped 17 cargos to-date, and with both Trains now running, we expect to ship an average of two to three cargos per week. Construction on Train 3 is progressing very well, and we expect first LNG in the second quarter of 2017. At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. We are leveraging our experience from Gorgon, and are pleased with our progress. Our modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are now onsite and the installation of piping, electrical, and instrumentation continue as planned. As we have foreshadowed, the delay in module delivery at Wheatstone has impacted project cost relative to the original 2011 estimate. We now forecast the total project cost at completion to be $34 billion. Chevron share of the cost to complete the project is included in the $17 billion to $22 billion capital guidance range that we have previously communicated for the 2017 to 2018 years. Bruce will now provide an update on our activities in the Permian. Bruce?\nBruce Niemeyer: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 10, as we have shared previously, Chevron enjoys a very strong acreage position in the Permian Basin. Our acreage is extensive, covering about 2 million acres. We have major holdings in the best basin locations and enjoy a significant royalty advantage over our competitors. Our strategy in the Permian is centered on building a large-scale asset that delivers strong returns and generates free cash flow. To accomplish this we have implemented a well factory modeled at the most -- modeled after the most efficient short cycle operations in Chevron and in industry. The goal of this factory is to create repeatable high value outcomes at sufficient scale that our material for Chevron. Decisions around many key design elements are consistently implemented, not only the obvious ones such as horizontal lateral length, well spacing and completion parameters, but also hundreds of other decisions that we face on a routine basis for which we want consistent outcomes. As we have identified and verify improvements, they are quickly implemented into our basis of design. Our pace has been intentionally deliberate to allow us to incorporate the learnings and experience from our own work and that of the industry. The result is a high degree of confidence that we will achieve the outcomes we expect, our results are competitive and continue to improve. Turning the Slide 11; you can see Chevrons acreage position in more detail. This slide is a map of the Permian Basin, inclusive of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our 2 million acres are depicted in blue, 1.5 million of which are in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Also depicted on the map are active Chevron operated developments in blue and are non-operated development areas in purple. We believe the quality of our acreage position is exceptional with multiple stacked geologic targets. Today we estimate that almost 600,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 per acre. We have an additional $350,000 acres with a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre. The balance of our acreage is a mix; some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation, some lacks nearby infrastructure and some requires further appraisal. These estimates are snapshot that assumes a simultaneous development, a flat $50 WTI price, and are burdened with all development and production costs as we see them today. We're active in several company operated and non-operated joint venture development areas. We're currently running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage. We're standing up on our ninth rig as we speak, and expect to be at ten by the end of the year. Another ten rigs are currently drilling our non-operated development areas. We prioritize development areas by value which considers expected ultimate recovery, cost of development, oil gas split, availability of surface infrastructure, and our overall certainty of outcome. Turning to Slide 12; to achieve strong returns we focus on all elements necessary to generate cash flow; capital efficiency, operating expense, and product realizations. The graph in the upper right corner shows development cost per barrel which in our view is the ultimate measure of capital performance as it incorporates all sub metrics. We have achieved a 30% development cost reduction from 2015, fully inclusive of drilling, completions, facilities, and associated G&A. We've accomplished this through a focus on improving expected ultimate recovery, driving execution efficiencies and implementing supply chain savings. This is delivering capital performance that is competitive with the operators of our joint ventures. The trend of improvement is mirrored in our overall unit operating expense; the lower right graph reflects both the downward trend and competitive performance of our direct lease operating expense, and illustrates a significant reduction of 45% from 2015. Our lease operating expense includes all costs required to operate a well and its associated facilities during its life. We expect these wells to produce for decades. So attention to operating efficiency unlocks value. Additionally, G&A which is not included in the graph on the lower right, is a component of overall operating expense. Our year-to-date G&A is $3.50 a barrel, declining through the year and more than 20% from 2015. The third critical aspect of cash flow is product realizations. We've leveraged the scale of our core positions to systematically secure cost-effective priority access through the entire crude and gas value chain, rather than simply selling production at the well-head. Because of this we have options available to respond to changing market and industry conditions. Turning to Slide 13; we expect activity and production from the Permian to grow through the end of the decade. As we discussed in our Analyst Day last March, by the end of 2020, Chevron's Permian shale and tight production is expected to reach 250,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. As you can see on the chart, we have initiated this growth. Production continues to track ahead of expectations and is 24% higher than third quarter 2015. We continually monitor our performance and have the option to adjust the pace of our growth as needed, to optimize value from this asset. While growing production is important, we're focused on expanding margins by increasing efficiencies in our operations and on capturing maximum value from the resource base. We believe we're well positioned to make the Permian a legacy asset with strong returns and free cash flow. Now I'll hand it back to Pat to discuss spend reductions. Pat?\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay, thank you, Bruce. Now on Slide 14; we continue to reduce our spend. You can see on the charts the huge progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating expense and capital expenditure outflows to be down more than $12 billion or more than 20% from 2015. We expect to meet, if not exceed the commitment we made earlier in the year to have 2016 operating expenses come in $2 billion lower than 2015. And our C&E is trending below the guidance range, previously provided for this year. We will likely end the year below $25 billion in capital outlays, in fact potentially coming in closer to $24 billion. This is a tremendous amount of progress in a relatively short 24-month period of time to reset these key financial parameters consistent with a lower for longer price environment. Turning to Slide 15, I'd like to close with just a couple of points. First, our financial priorities have not changed, sustaining and growing the dividend is our first priority. The increase this quarter demonstrates that commitment which is underpinned by confidence in our future earnings and cash flow growth. Second, we are beginning to see evidence of that cash flow growth, notably now that Gorgon Train 1 is operating well, and Train 2 is successfully online, and with Gorgon's Train 3 and Wheatstone's Trains 1 and 2 planned to come on in fairly rapid succession over the next five quarters. We have approximately 85% of the production from these five trains sold under long-term contracts, and at today's contractual LNG prices, this represents a significant revenue and cash margin boost. Third, we have successfully transitioned to a lower price environment. Of course we are not resting on these recent accomplishments, we will continue to look for opportunities to improve cost and capital efficiency. We are poised to be a very resilient competitor in a low price world, our Permian assets they speaks directly to this. Here we have an abundance of riches in terms of the physical asset base and we are successfully demonstrating the ability to develop this resource in a highly capital-efficient, returns focused manner. With cost coming down with C&E and capital intensity coming down with our major LNG projects and the Permian production coming online to boost cash margins and production, our overall financial picture is set to improve in a meaningful way as we move into 2017. Our objective is to get cash balance in 2017 assuming $50 Brent prices. All of these improvements I've just noted, as well as targeted asset sales where we can transact for value are key components supporting that objective. So this concludes our prepared remarks and we're now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue and try to limit yourself to one question or perhaps one follow-up if necessary, we'll certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, could you open the lines, please?\nOperator: Certainly, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason gamble from Jefferies. Your question please?\nJason Gammel: Thanks very much everyone. And thanks especially for the incremental disclosure on the Permian, I'd like to direct my question there. Bruce, you mentioned that the finding and development cost was probably one of the most important metrics that you have in the basin. Can you talk about how you are benchmarking yourself against some of the E&P companies in the basin and how you think that might improve as you get your infrastructure into place?\nBruce Niemeyer: Thanks for the question, Jason. On Slide 12, we showed finding and development cost per barrel. The lighter bars are the Chevron operated activity, and the darker bars are those of our and NOJV competitors where we also invest. The -- that is our best direct benchmarking comparison because we invest in the wells and we're able to see the full value chain that is created. We are able to address the issues directly at financial performance that aren't often available from a less complete dataset. I suppose there is a narrative that a company of our size can't be competitive but in the case of Chevron, we are. The NOJV partners that are listed on this chart are some of the best in the basin, and you can see on the chart that our performance today is competitive and improving.\nJason Gammel: That's great. If just as a follow-up, can you maybe address the pace of development that you think you could achieve? I recognize that you've got your projection of volumes through 2020 but with such huge acreage position, what type of rig program do you think you could ultimately apply in the basin? And then I suppose the other question there would be, just given the position you have, would you maybe consider monetizing some of the position through acreage sales or through joint ventures?\nBruce Niemeyer: Let me start with pace first. So we are already growing; as I noted, we've initiated the growth, in fact we've added five rigs over essentially the second half of 2016. That's the pace of rig additions of about one rig a month. Productions grown from the third quarter of last year by 24% further supporting the notion that we're growing. And our pace and rate of indications [ph] are intentional. Again, we're focused on returns -- I don't feel capital limited in the Permian Basin, and our additions are targeted to ensure that we're getting the outcomes we intend and that are supportive of high returns and eventually generate -- generating free cash flow. We do expect to grow, as you noted you can see that on the Slide 13. And as we go forward, we have options; we continually monitor our performance and we adjust.\nPatricia Yarrington: And Jason, let me just add a thought to that. As you know, we have had a practice when we have had pieces of our portfolio where we felt there wasn't a longer term strategic value or it felt others could -- would offer more value for us and it would obtain in our portfolio, we've been willing to make asset sales and we've had a very routine practice of asset sells over a long number of years here. I think the key to getting to that point in the decision process though is having a really good understanding of the value of the asset. And in the Permian Basin, there has been a great deal of fluidity in that valuation over the last couple of years. There's been a great deal of additional appraisal and evaluation work, and there's been a great deal of greater understanding but there still has been significant movement. In some cases pieces of property have moved up by a factor of 10,000 fold. And that's the kind of thing that you would not want to get on the wrong side of -- if in your haste to make a decision about selling an asset. So our process will be to try to do a valuation an appraisal work -- get a really good understanding of what this asset valuation is, and to the extent that we don't find it fitting into our longer term development plan, than -- that of course we would look to other monetization options.\nBruce Niemeyer: Thanks, Jason.\nJason Gammel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please?\nPaul Sankey: Good morning, everyone. Thanks. A follow-up for Bruce on the Permian. How much do you guys spending there annually? Could you give us an idea of the level of CapEx and the outlook for CapEx?\nBruce Niemeyer: Yes, Paul. We're spending presently in the area of about $1.5 billion annually, across both the company-operated and our non-operative joint venture programs.\nPaul Sankey: So the outlook for that is flat is it or is that going to go up?\nBruce Niemeyer: I would expect it to go up. The -- at our current pace we're delivering a growth profile, you can see on Slide 13 what we shared at the Analyst Day last March in terms of production growth and there will be some growing activity that would support that. We are continually getting more efficient and so the -- the capital invested that we expect going forward will be more efficient as kind of reflected by the finding and development cost trend that we showed on Slide 12.\nPaul Sankey: Understood. So if I look at the Tengiz expansion, you are spending -- previously in September you had said $18 per BOE of development cost for I think a $36 billion investment. Why would you be spending so much less in the Permian at what I think looks like a $10 F&D cost per barrel? Maybe that one is for Pat.\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes, it is. So Paul, just a couple of things; I mean if you go back to Slide 13 here, I think we have said that -- and we said this back in the same and throughout the year here that we could see that top like -- the top end of that light blue portion of the profile there would result in approximately a doubling of our current activity levels. And so we're spending 1.5 here, you can see us potentially doubling that, and that is kind of the current view that we have but again, this is an area that we'll update you when we get to the March Security Analyst Meeting. In reference to FGP, the Future Growth Project and -- I think you know it's important to know that we are funding both of these projects, both the Permian fully and FGP. We think of these projects -- these areas as being absolutely critical growth areas for us. So we're not starving the Permian because we've taken on FGP. I think what people often miss around FGP is that there would be a tremendous loss of value if we didn't go forward with the well-head pressure management project because the field would go into decline, it would be in serious decline and that would be loss of value in the legacy asset. We're doing FGP and WPMP together because of synergies that's a joint development concept, and there is a lot of upside that has not been kind of built-in to a lot of people's models, I guess I would say about FGP that relate to the debottlenecking, what we've been able to demonstrate in the past -- we hope to be able to do on a go forward basis. There is additional gas handling facilities built in here that will overtime allow greater oil production, contingencies we've talked through about being kind of fully contingent, even though we're at 50% of engineering when we took FIB. And then of course down the road, obviously we hope that this turns into concession extension. So there is a lot of potential upside to FGP, I think Jay did a great job on our second quarter call in kind of running through all of those parameters.\nPaul Sankey: Got it. So what you are saying is the $18 is a very conservative -- $18 per barrel development cost is a very conservative number and it would be competitive with the Permian ultimately when all of these things are considered?\nPatricia Yarrington: We think we need both assets in our portfolio, yes.\nPaul Sankey: Thank you, Pat.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please?\nPaul Cheng: Good morning. Two questions if I could. Bruce on the -- what is the recovery rate that you use to get to that 9 billion barrel? Are you just saying 10%, 12% -- what do you expect and foresee that recovery rate may change over the next, say five years?\nBruce Niemeyer: Yes. So the 9 billion barrels is from a portion of our acreage that is currently highly characterized, it varies by horizon and by area in the basin, be it Midland or Delaware Basin; recoveries are generally single digit and we know that in a basin were to play at the state of maturity there is a lot of upside potential. We have a technology organization that's working hard every day to take the first stage of development and improve upon it, much as we have in other asset classes that we operate in and are more mature.\nPaul Cheng: Will you be willing to give in what the forecast -- what that recovery rate may look like in five years?\nBruce Niemeyer: No, not at this point.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Pat, a second question then on Wheatstone, you're talking about the cost increase. Given the lower Australian dollar and supposedly weaker labor market which has translated into better productivities; can you elaborate a little bit more on what's causing the cost increase?\nPatricia Yarrington: Sure, Paul. As I said, we're now expecting a $34 billion total project cost. So that's up about $5 billion from the original AR. That original appropriation request was taken in 2011 and as you can all appreciate, the first few years of construction there was in a much more heated market. But we've talked in the past about our late module delivery, and this really was one of the primary drivers behind the cost increase. They were delayed due to poor performance at one of the fabricating yard, it came to be that the contractor was unable to effectively manage the size and the scale of the work scope that we had given that particular contractor. So we recognized that somewhat early on and we did end up redirecting some of the work to other yards, but even so, modules were late. A second factor that I would comment on is really an underestimation of the quantity of materials that were required. At the time we took FID on Wheatstone, we had -- engineering was at about 15% complete and so the rest was based on rules of thumb and factors. As we matured, the engineering definition -- the definition -- the amount of quantities needed increased substantially, and so that really was a secondary reason behind the cost increase. I would say the second element was something that we had seen on Gorgon as well, and it is one of the primary areas where we are trying to improve our project execution going forward. As you know we had FGP when we took FID on FGP, we were at about nearly a 50% engineering level. So this is one of the primary improvement practices that we're putting in place for future projects.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Your question please?\nPhil Gresh: Good morning. Bruce, you had made a comment on one of the earlier questions about free cash flow focus and I'm just kind of wondering if you take together what you've said about capital spending and the production outlook; when would you expect the Permian to become free cash flow positive? And how do you think about some of the assets in the Permian that might need some more material infrastructure spending? Is that something that you guys are really willing to spend a lot of money on in the next few years or are you more focused on kind of more immediate cash flow?\nBruce Niemeyer: Thanks for the question Phil. We'll provide more color and specifics in the Analyst Day next March. We do have internal projections on when the overall program reaches free cash flow, and that obviously depends on a number of factors including the trajectory that we pursue and I'll remind you again, we have many options to adjust based on the results that we see. We do have an integrated approach where we not only connect the upstream activity that we're engaged in drilling and completing wells, but pair that with midstream activity to move our product to the market centers that we choose. We typically engage in that through commercial transactions; it's a very competitive basin, there is a lot of companies that operate in that space. We typically deploy our capital in the areas where we can differentiate our performance and drilling and completions, and then working with high quality third-party suppliers, look to them to move the crude to market, operate the gas processing and NGL fractionation activities.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, got it, thanks. And then my follow-up -- I guess maybe this would be best for Pat, kind of following on what Paul was asking about $10 F&D in the Permian, $18 for Tengiz. Where would you say -- as you're assessing the deepwater opportunities in the portfolio, particularly the brownfield side of things; how would that stack up at this stage as costs continue to come down?\nPatricia Yarrington: Brownfield would be very good. Greenfield would be a little bit more challenge but brownfield would be very good.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please?\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Pat and Bruce and Frank, I am not sure who wants to take this one -- but I guess that Chevron has always been a company led by large-scale major project developments, explorations, and so on. And I guess what I am really trying to understand here is what are the limiting factors on the Permian given its flexibility, lower execution risk, the absence of the cost issues you've have had and things like Gorgon and Wheatstone. I guess what I'm asking is -- is the Permian big enough to drive a much more meaningful strategic shift and how it allocates -- Chevron allocates capital longer-term? Is that what we're looking at here?\nPatricia Yarrington: I think best if I take that one here, Doug. I think when you have such an extraordinary asset base in the Permian, when it has as much kind of depth and breadth to it and I don't mean that in a literal sense but a figurative sense. Such huge economic strength, everything in the portfolio really needs to be judged against those options. And so when I think about -- we don't believe we want to be just a single asset class company; so we have great strategic capabilities and basin positions in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, we have the Tengiz project that we talked about, we have the LNG project. So we have pretty broad-based portfolio over here and we're not looking to take all activity down to the Permian. But the value of the Permian and its tremendous economic capability and its capital efficiency, its great flexibility, its short-cycle high-return attributes does make other parts of the portfolio have to compete for capital against that. So I think it raises the bar on where that incremental but the dollar is going to go and I think Permian will get the first call but we will manage it as a portfolio, and overtime you should still expect us to have some significant other projects but we can pace those projects quite nicely I think and match against -- always coming back to and matching against the opportunities the Permian provides for us.\nDoug Leggate: So is it pretty simply, Pat, the Permian is going to take market share from the rest of your portfolio, is that a good way of thinking about it?\nPatricia Yarrington: I think that's reasonable within limits. I think that's reasonable, yes. And we'll go through more of this in the Security Analyst Meeting, we'll go through more of this in March because I think that's really where it's the appropriate time to lay out on portfolio.\nDoug Leggate: And I guess a related question my follow-up is; there has been -- we haven't talked much about disposals and I guess in a couple quarters. I am guessing a high grading exercise, if you want to call it that way, the Permian changes the map a little bit in terms of what competes for capital. There has been some speculation around Bangladesh which is sizable obviously, I think you have talked about that publicly. Can you just give us an update as to where you see the changing map on disposals, both in scale and perhaps any identified assets that have changed since the Analyst Day?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes. We really haven't changed our view -- I mean we look at asset sales when we can get good value, that's first and foremost; not strategic or we don't see kind of the compelling relationship within the Chevron portfolio. We've announced certain assets for sale and we've put a list out in the second quarter there; the list essentially is the same, I can't confirm that there are commercial discussions going on in and around Bangladesh. But I'll go back to the primary element here which is, we want to get good value. And so on any of these transactions that we've sort of queued up and are beginning to have people into data rooms, either in an early round or a secondary round -- if in fact we don't get the value proposition that we're seeking, then we'll just move on.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks very much.\nBruce Niemeyer: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please?\nEd Westlake: Yes, good morning. So that Slide 12 is great, and shows how you've made improvement. I mean I guess you're still a little bit above the development cost of the non-operated JV partners, maybe is that geographical, is there some different ways that you approach the business? So just maybe some color on that.\nBruce Niemeyer: Sure, Ed. We're providing you on this chart quarterly data and it's an aggregation of everything that was completed in that particular quarter, and you're right to suspect that there is a little portfolio aspect to what goes on in any particular quarter. We have operations in both the Midland and Delaware basin on the company operated side, and on the NOJV side as well. And the mix of activity in any particular quarter is going to cause those bars to be up and down a little bit. If we had the fourth quarter of 2015, you'd see two quarters where the company operated bars are a little lower and the last two quarters whether the NOJV bars are a little lower. But we would look internally in a much finer level of detail. Wolfcamp B wells in the Central Midland Basin, mile and a half laterals and ROE comparable in that activity or not and what do we address about that. So the overall performance is competitive and I will tell you that there is a competitive group, there is a lead pack in the Permian, and we're a part of that. And I think the data on Slide 12 shows that and some of the quarter-to-quarter variations are simply a function of which particular wells are completing and because our costs include full cycle, there are facility costs in our bars in the quarter in which we start wells in the new area and have central tank batteries or other things that are being executed in that period.\nEd Westlake: And then I mean -- I mean this is just a great portfolio with also tax and royalty advantages. And you will want to get after it; the rest of the industry is getting after it. Maybe just give us some high-level thoughts about inflation. On the one hand there is probably still learnings that can improve that development cost as you progress. On the other hand, things might get a little hot over the next few years. So maybe just some high level thoughts as to how you think about that?\nBruce Niemeyer: We've certainly driven in the last two years to a very positive position. We operate in a dynamic price environment and dynamic activity environment. Over the last few years we really leverage the scale of Chevron where we have an advantage to do so. So tubulars or the pipe that goes in the wells is a key cost component and Chevron buys a lot of pipe around the world; so we're able to leverage our worldwide supply chain effort to bring advantage to pricing to what we do. We also consolidate work with key suppliers -- have consolidated work to give us the right combination of unit price, execution performance access to technology and the ability to grow with us. And then we've put in place some contractual arrangements with unit based fixed terms, some are index based, some use performance incentives, but they're all intended to keep us on the competitive side of the price curve, irrespective of what commodity prices are doing. Structurally the things that stay with us in any price environment are multi-well pad designs which we've done for a very long time, the acreage position that we have that allow us to drill longer lateral lengths, efficiencies as we engage in on a daily basis in terms of something we call zipper fracing [ph] where you have activities occurring simultaneously. And those will stay us regardless of what price does.\nEd Westlake: Thanks, Bruce.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please?\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, everyone. Pat, really good progress here on capital spending. Where do you believe we're tracking relative to guidance here in 2016 for CapEx? And then relative to the $17 billion to $22 billion, any early look of how the deflation you've seen in '16 will carry forward?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes, so I think we had said before that 2016 we thought would come in at 25, around 25. I think last time I said even below 25 and this time I'm really thinking we'll probably be closer to 24. So significant reduction from a year ago time. We're in the process of doing our business plan, right now the range that we've put out for '17 to '18 is in the $17 billion to $22 billion range. I think we will be in that range, we're just going through and doing the prioritization at the moment and we'll come out typically with a C&E press release after our board approves the plan and I don't really want to get ahead of that but obviously all of the efficiencies, the cost efficiencies that we've seen -- Bruce just talked through some of those in his business unit but those are going on around the globe in terms of supplier optimization, supplier rationalization, and getting our supply chain costs down. That will continue and I think we will hold onto that. The one area where there probably is a little bit of an inflationary element will all will be the Permian because that's where investment is being attracted. But when you look around the rest of the world, that is really not happening in the rest of the world; investment is not going to those locations. So we're not seeing those kind of cost pressures, so we believe the efficiencies through the supply chain organization we've been able to capture will hold there.\nNeil Mehta: That is a good follow-up. And maybe this is for Bruce here, as you see activity pick up in the Permian, do you see any bottlenecks, either from an infrastructure perspective, labor perspective, or other parts of that resource that will make it difficult for you to achieve the high-end of the range that we talked about?\nBruce Niemeyer: We certainly recognize Neil that we have to plan ahead and we do so. When you think about takeaway, our efforts in maximizing realization have a secondary component which is flow assurance to make sure that we're able to move to the market centers locations where we ultimately wish to sell without being disrupted. When you get to the supply of drilling and completing wells, the suppliers that we work with, we pick intentionally, in part for their ability to grow; both in terms of the availability of the equipment, the type of equipment we want, and their staffing plans in terms of how they will staff and maintain that staffing going forward. So there will be some changes overall in the basin but we're taking a multi-year view and able to look a little bit into the future and based our planning around that.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please?\nBlake Fernandez: Good morning. Pat, going back to some of the -- back to the deflationary pressures you're seeing on CapEx. I think you alluded to a $50 Brent breakeven which is pretty consistent with what you had articulated before. Is it fair to think that that number is trending lower also?\nPatricia Yarrington: We are working very hard to get that number lower, absolutely. And it certainly has moved down from when we first put that target out there, yes; meaning our actuals are moving in that direction. So yes, we are trying as best we can through operating efficiencies, capital efficiencies to have our outflows contained relative to the inflows that we anticipate coming out there. So it's what I consider to be a cost structure reset and a capital expenditure reset given the environment that we're in.\nBlake Fernandez: Okay, fair enough. And then, Bruce, on the Permian, it looks like you are trending above the top end of guidance or your range. Obviously you're adding rigs, we probably haven't seen the full impact of that yet. Is there any reason to believe that you are not on-track to potentially surpass what the upper-end of this range is here?\nBruce Niemeyer: Well, we're ahead now and our guidance remains the same at this point to 2020, 250,000 to 350,000 barrels a day. Our Analyst Day in March is the typical time where we would unpack more of that for you and everybody else.\nBlake Fernandez: Good deal, I appreciate it.\nBruce Niemeyer: Thanks, Blake.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please?\nEvan Calio: Good afternoon and good results today. My first question, staying with the Permian; Bruce I know some of your acreage in Southwest Reeves overlaps Apache's recently announced Alpine High Play. Can you share your view on the viability of that play, potential economics and how that would or may compete for capital with this Permian core that you have laid out today?\nBruce Niemeyer: Sure, Evan. Let me start first by saying we're excited by this activity and hope it's fully successful. We have 180,000 acres in our portfolio and you can see it there on the slide. But it's a great example of how our strategy has played out across the Permian allowing the industry to de-risk and create data that can refine our assessment. Alpine High, that area in the southern part of Reeves County is right now on our overall portfolio pie, in that wedge it is -- that is labeled less than $20,000 per acre, subsurface. And the subsurface is structurally more complex, it appears to be a little more gassy and it's far from existing infrastructure. But additional positive data certainly has the potential to move that area to higher value and if it does, we go through a regular resort of priorities and we would adjust our activity as that indicated.\nEvan Calio: Great. And then maybe my second is -- it's a follow-up to some prior Permian questions. But just to understand, I mean does the upside to your Permian production range, which is the same as it was in May despite improvements here; does that represent the limit to how much you can grow in a capital efficient manner and maybe that looks achievable on a 30-rig program by the end of 2020? And if so, like what are the limiting factors in your current plan to how much the Permian can take and subsequently grow?\nBruce Niemeyer: Our focus in the near-term and quite frankly throughout is on capital efficiency. And we are focused not on chasing a particular production curve -- growing production is important, growing bond is important but retaining efficiency throughout what we do, and we have many options; going forward to adjust our pace of activity up and down. We have the ability to grow activity but it is returns that we are ultimately focused on and that will drive our decision making going forward.\nEvan Calio: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets. Your question please?\nBrendan Warn: Good morning or good afternoon, wherever you are sitting in the world. I'm going to ask a question away from the Permian if I can; if I could just get an update on Rosebank in the UK North Sea, just in terms of -- I know you are out sort of rebidding and renegotiating. Just how you're seeing that project stack up in terms of its cost? And if you can give any update I can have a follow-up, please.\nPatricia Yarrington: Well, I think all I can say at this point -- I mean we are in essence staying with that project in feed while we're trying to get the development costs down. So I don't have a lot of specific information to provide for you but obviously with what's happened to oil prices, what's happened to the optionality that we have here in the Permian; there is a competing for capital element that Rosebank has to fight for within our portfolio. So when I was continuing to work at it -- we've recognize how important Rosebank is to the region, we recognized how important it is to the U.K. but we have in the past been able to take a look -- a second look at the design and get costs down. In the past we've been able to kind of re-characterize the subsurface and work improvements in there, and we're just still on that same process.\nBrendan Warn: And then a follow-up, just how much would the weaker pound assist that project in terms of economics?\nPatricia Yarrington: Obviously it would help but I don't have the ability to quantify that for you at the moment.\nBrendan Warn: Okay, thank you. Thanks, Pat.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Your question please?\nAnish Kapadia: Hi, my first question was on some of your other potential international project sanctions. I wanted to get a little bit of an update on the Gulf of Mexico projects, where you are at in terms of the appraisals and potential development. So the ones I was thinking of were the Anchor projects, the Tigris project and Sicily.\nPatricia Yarrington: So an anchor we're still in the appraisal process; we feel positive about it but we're still in the appraisal process there. On the Tigris there is multiple fields that are involved here; appraisal drilling has been completed and we have filed for a suspension of production here. Officially [ph], we've allowed to leases to elapse.\nAnish Kapadia: Okay, thank you. And then I had a question for Bruce on the Permian. Again, thank you for the useful slides that you've put out. In terms of the -- high graded area that you have talked about, the 600,000 acres; within that I was wondering if you could give some idea of the number of locations that are contained within that in your current thinking. And which benches you're looking at are you currently thinking are going to be developed in that acreage?\nBruce Niemeyer: The areas that are at the top of our Q vary between the Midland and Delaware Basin as do the horizons. The things that we're most interested in are again those that create the right kind of full cycle returns. And so the oil/gas split between those areas, the cost of execution of those areas are what causes it to be in the Top Tier for us. So in the Midland Basin, Wolfcamp B and lower Sprayberry are two area -- are two horizons that we like a lot. We also like some aspects of the Wolfcamp in the Delaware Basin. We're drilling wells in a few other horizons but there isn't a one-size fits all; you'll move to one part of the basin and that particular horizon that you're interested in is just not as great a value as others. So what we do in these development areas is -- put together a strategy that paces development based on value. We go to best performing horizon on a return basis first, and then follow it with the others. And that -- there is not a simple answer that's fits the whole basin.\nAnish Kapadia: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please?\nRyan Todd: Hi, thanks. Great result, maybe I'll stick up on the trend and ask one Permian question followed by another one. In the Permian, if you look at your acreage, if you look on the map on 11, and you've shown this map a number of different times but I mean you've still got a lot of checkerboard acreage across core portions of the Permian basin. Any further interest at this point in potential JVs or partnerships like you did with Cimarex in the past that would allow for an increasing amount of long laterals and capital efficient developments? Or how do you think about managing that acreage going forward?\nBruce Niemeyer: It's a good question. We are actually very actively engaged in swaps working with individuals that we don't have rights to checkerboard at acreage and we've actually executed quite a number of those, it does allow us to extend laterals, concentrate facilities and infrastructure in certain places. We will also contemplate joint ventures where that leads us to the right kind of return outcomes. If a combination of acreage in some way leads to a more efficient result but I would tell you that what's been more active for us in the last year and a half has been finding acreage consolidations that we can make through swaps and that's bolstered by the fact that our company operated execution is becoming highly efficient, and those are the sorts of activities that are driving returns to the top of our Q.\nRyan Todd: Great, thanks. And then maybe if I could ask one -- maybe a question for Pat there, kind of a high-level philosophical one. I mean if we -- if we look at what the majors such as yourself have been able to do in terms of capital reduction over the past couple years; I think it's been quite impressive. And as we look forward over the next let's say two to five years, and I realize there is a lot of variable in this. How do you think about what a reasonable level of sustainable CapEx is? I mean if you talk about potentially being sub-$20 billion a year in a 2017, is -- has there been enough structural cost deflation or efficiency gains that that is kind of a reasonable medium-term level to think about longer-term? Or does that still feel like capital starvation mode and there is a need to bounce back into some level in the 20s as more sustainable over the medium-term?\nPatricia Yarrington: Yes. So I think the critical variable that you're leaving unsaid there is what's happening to price. You know just a little bit on price, I think our own view here is that in the medium-term here we're potentially going to be range bound; we are constructive on price and we do think overtime, here you will -- there will be price appreciation but we see it being relatively modest. But in the period that we're talking about here, I don't see that change -- changing our view of the $17 billion to $22 billion range being appropriate for us. You are hearing an awful lot about the Permian being one of the best investment opportunities that we have and the great thing about that is -- that it's short cycle, it's high return, it's very flexible and so that gives us -- it lowers our capital intensity, gives us greater flexibility than we have had in several years. And the only other major project that we've sanctioned at this point in time is TCO and our share of that in terms of an outflow would be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion a year over the next few years. So we consider that to be very manageable and that's within the $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you. So I think that's a reasonable range on C&E to expect for us under a regional -- a reasonable range of prices that might be anticipated. Okay, I think we have time -- all right, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off but I think we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question then comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please?\nPavel Molchanov: Thank you, guys. Just a quick one about Nigeria. You mentioned losing 28,000 a day in Q3. What kind of recovery have you seen on your Nigerian assets so far this quarter? And what is embedded in the exit rate guidance that you gave for the year?\nPatricia Yarrington: Well, I mean I think we have two factors going on; we have had some instances of sabotage as we've talked about, we had a more recent one here in the last couple of days. So that's it -- obviously a detriment that is impacting Nigerian production. But on the opposite side we've got a [indiscernible] expense \u2013 extension, plateau extension investment coming online. So I think that it's not a huge factor in terms of a variance and what we're showing for the December exit range.\nPavel Molchanov: I appreciate it.\nPatricia Yarrington: Okay, thanks. All right, so I think that concludes our call for the third quarter here. I'd like to thank everybody for your time on the call. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and we appreciate everybody's participation on the call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-07-29 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thank you very much, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two. I'll begin with a recap of our second quarter 2016 financial results, and then Jay will provide an update on our Upstream business prior to my concluding remarks. Turning to slide three, slide three provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter loss was $1.5 billion or negative $0.78 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $2.8 billion. These are primarily associated with certain assets, where through a combination of reservoir performance and price, revenue from oil and gas production is not expected to recover costs. Excluding these items as well as the impact of asset sale gains of $420 million and foreign exchange effects of $279 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $661 million or $0.35 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Cash from operations for the quarter was $2.5 billion. And our debt ratio at quarter end was approximately 23%. Our net debt ratio was a bit under 20%. During the second quarter we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2016. We currently yield 4.2%. Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $2.5 billion during the second quarter and $3.7 billion year to date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than the first quarter, commensurate with rising crude prices. Working capital effects of $2 billion and $2 billion in deferred tax items \u2013 for example, those associated with tax loss positions \u2013 reduced year to date operating cash. These are generally transitory effects, which reverse in future periods. We expect a portion of the working capital drain to reverse later this year. Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, mainly from the sale of our New Zealand marketing assets, Canadian natural gas storage assets, and pipeline assets in North America. Cash capital expenditures were $4.5 billion, a decrease of over $3 billion from second quarter 2015 and down more than $1 billion from the first quarter of 2016. At quarter end our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled approximately $9 billion. And our net debt position was $36 billion. Turning to slide five, slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2016 results were $2 billion lower than second quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the absence of the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of Caltex Australia Limited, partially offset by the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of New Zealand marketing, reduced earnings by $1.4 billion between periods. In both quarters depreciation expense was impacted by impairments and other charges. The swing in foreign exchange impacts improved earnings by $530 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $528 million between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by lower exploration and operating expenses as well as other unrelated positive variances. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by $535 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Turning now to slide six, I'll now compare results for the second quarter of 2016 with the first quarter of 2016. Second quarter results were $745 million lower than the first quarter. Net special items for impairments, project suspensions, and other related charges decreased earnings by $2.2 billion between periods. Foreign exchange created a positive earnings variance of nearly $600 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased approximately $1.2 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations in line with our price sensitivity as well as lower exploration and depreciation charges. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $79 million, as lower operating expenses were more than offset by inventory revaluation effects. The variance in the Other segment largely reflects unfavorable corporate tax items. Jay will now review our worldwide quarterly production and provide an update on our Upstream operations. Jay?\nJames William Johnson: Thanks, Pat. I'll start with second quarter 2016 production and then provide an update on a few of our key Upstream projects. Slide seven compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2016 and the second quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 68,000 barrels a day between these quarters, yielding first half 2016 production of 2.6 million barrels a day. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian with the Marcellus, Vaca Muerta, Duvernay, and Liard Basins also reflecting year-on-year growth. Major capital projects increased production by 37,000 barrels a day, as ramp-ups continue at Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei, and Angola LNG. And we saw initial production from Gorgon. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 63,000 barrels per day, which included the Partitioned Zone, security issues in Nigeria, and fires in Canada. The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 44,000 barrels a day. The decrease of 48,000 barrels a day in the base business and other bar reflects normal field declines and higher turnaround activity, partially offset by new base business production from brownfield investments. The chart shown on slide eight was presented in January and outlined our production guidance and uncertainties for 2016. The cumulative impact of the uncertainties has been unfavorable. And we expect to be near the bottom of the annualized guidance we provided. For example, we anticipated that oil production in the Partitioned Zone would be restarted by mid-year, which hasn't happened. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2015 this field produced over 75,000 barrels a day, Chevron's share. We've also worked through various start-up issues at Gorgon that impacted our first half production. We've been successful with our Upstream divestment program, which is impacting our production. Transactions closed this year represent a daily production rate of just over 40,000 barrels a day. And we expect to see an additional 15,000 to 30,000 daily barrels leaving the portfolio before the end of this year. In addition to these uncertainties, production in the third quarter will be adversely impacted by a large number of turnarounds, including the second generation plant at Tengiz. At the same time our long anticipated queue of projects is now coming online. In the second half of this year we expect to see sustained production from Angola LNG, Gorgon Trains 1 and 2, and all three trains at Chuandongbei. We are also expecting continued growth from the Permian, which I'll talk further in a few minutes. The overall result is that we expect to exit the year with the December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day. Turning to slide nine, funding the completion of projects under construction is our first capital allocation priority. At Gorgon, we're currently producing at 70% of Train 1's capacity, or approximately 90,000 barrels per day. In early July we took a short shutdown to address a number of issues and repair a minor leak. Production resumed mid-July, and the plant has been running smoothly since that time. We're incorporating all the experience gained from Train 1's construction, completion, and initial operations into Train 2 and Train 3. Construction on Train 2 and Train 3 is progressing very well. We expect first LNG from Train 2 early in the fourth quarter and from Train 3 in the second quarter of 2017. At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. The cleanup and testing of all nine development wells has been completed and the rig has been released. Initial results are in line with expectations. At the plant site, piping, electrical, and instrumentation work is currently progressing very well. We're working to maintain this progress, as we begin the transition to completion, commissioning, and startup activities. Train 2 construction work is also progressing per plan, with startup expected six to eight months after Train 1. Slide 10 shows our other 2016 startups. At Angola LNG, modifications were completed at the plant, and production restarted on May 20. Since restarting the plant, we've loaded four LNG and seven LPG cargoes. The plant was tested at 75% capacity and ran smoothly prior to the planned shutdown for strainer and other maintenance activities. The modifications to the gas conditioning section operated as designed, and all other repairs are complete. We expect to achieve sustained production during the third quarter. At Chuandongbei, Train 3 started up in late May, and all three trains have delivered at full capacity and are now operational. There have been no changes since our previous updates on Alder, Mafumeira Sul, or Bangka. Turning to slide 11, our next capital priority is to fund high-return short-cycle base and shale and tight investments. First among these opportunities is the Permian, where we have a large royalty advantaged acreage position. We're making excellent progress in the Permian towards the growth we discussed at our analyst meeting in March. Production this quarter was 21% or 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day higher than the second quarter of last year. Efficiency gains and a shift to more Chevron-operated rigs have more than offset the reduction in total rig count. We're delivering our plan with fewer rigs and less cost. Turn to slide 12. As we've said before, one of our primary benchmarking metrics for our Permian assets is development cost per barrel. Since the second quarter of last year, we've reduced our unit development costs by approximately 30%. We've been able to accelerate our performance improvements by incorporating industry best practices and applying lessons learned from our joint ventures and contractors. As shown by the data, our development cost is competitive with our joint venture partners. The table shows improvement in our drilling and completion cost performance from recent pad drilling programs. For 7,500-foot laterals in the Midland Basin, we're averaging $5.6 million per well, which is a 25% reduction from what we showed you at our analyst meeting in March. Our recovery per well is also improving, as we continue to implement learnings and optimize our lateral lengths, well completions, and drawdown strategies. Earlier this year, we exceeded 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in a 24-hour well test on a 7,500-foot lateral well in the Greater Bryant G area. We also put our 100th company-operated horizontal well in production and continue to gain confidence in our acreage characterization and performance. We're taking a disciplined, measured approach to development, and we're optimizing and prioritizing the large number of available well locations. We're delivering on our objective to be a competitive operator whose royalty position provides an incremental competitive advantage, and we're consistently improving our financial performance. Slide 13, in addition to the Permian and other large-scale short-cycle businesses such as San Joaquin and Gulf of Thailand, we have a number of attractive major capital projects that leverage previous investments. The projects listed on this slide all take advantage of existing infrastructure, reducing development costs and cycle time. As they build upon existing developments, they also tend to carry less subsurface and execution risk. The average development cost for these projects is around $15 a barrel. At Jack and St. Malo, we continue to ramp up production. In June the combined production for both fields reached 110,000 barrels a day. This was accomplished through continued high facility reliability and the startup of the eighth well. The first Stage 2 well is expected to come online next month. Turning to Slide 14, a major brownfield opportunity that we've talked about many times is the future growth and wellhead pressure management project in Tengiz. As we announced earlier this month, the TCO partnership sanctioned the project. WPMP provides additional wells and pressure boosting facilities to maintain production levels in the existing plants as reservoir pressures decline. FGP builds on the sour gas injection technology already proven in existing operations at Tengiz. It adds additional production and gas injection capacity to increase total oil production by around 260,000 barrels a day. The project is designed to capture execution and infrastructure efficiencies and will take advantage of current market conditions. Incremental recovery is expected to be 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Turning to slide 15, FGP/WPMP is estimated to cost $36.8 billion, which includes $27 billion for facilities, $3.5 billion for wells, and $6.2 billion for contingency and escalation. The development cost for the project is $18 a barrel. Operating and transportation costs are expected to be consistent with our existing operations. TCO has secured financing to ensure uninterrupted project funding, utilizing a combination of bank loans, co-lending, and bonds. Demand for the first tranche of the bond offering was strong, and the bonds were placed at an attractive interest rate. Go to slide 16. As I've discussed, we're committed to improving our project execution performance across the enterprise. I've used this slide previously to describe the actions we're taking on the projects in order to deliver strong execution performance and mitigate the amount of contingency consumed. We're confident these actions will improve our ability to deliver this project predictably and reliably. And I'll update you on a few examples. Engineering is currently greater than 50% complete, well ahead of industry practice of 25% or less at FID. Having a more advanced engineering design provides a better understanding of the quantity and quality of materials, equipment, and labor required to execute the project, and reduces the likelihood of out-of-sequence work and construction delays due to engineering issues. The project team and principal contractor have been integrated into one team with fewer layers of management, lower cost, and more effective leadership. Turning to slide 17, we're pleased to see this project enter execution and are excited about the value the project brings to Kazakhstan, TCO, and our shareholders. Tengiz is a world-class reservoir. And FGP/WPMP provides the foundation for the continued economic development of the field. The project utilizes technology already proven at Tengiz. It addresses declining reservoir pressure and enhances recovery from the reservoir. This counter cyclical investment takes advantage of the current market in terms of cost savings, fabrication capacity, and contractor capabilities. Project economics are attractive within the current concession life and include 20% contingency. The project provides additional upside opportunities, including future in-field drilling, facility debottlenecking, increased oil production from existing plants, as well as additional enhanced recovery projects. A concession extension or utilizing less contingency would also provide additional benefits. Tengiz has been an excellent asset for Chevron. And this investment will allow Tengiz to continue to generate value into the future. I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss our progress on spend reduction.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Now turning to slide 18, we are delivering on our committed spend reductions. You'll note the steep reduction in quarterly C&E average over the past three years. Year to date, capital expenditures are down 31% when compared with 2015. We're on a trend line for 2016 C&E of $25 billion or less. For 2017 \u2013 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures between $17 billion and $22 billion. If the current price environment persists, we will revisit the bottom end of the range, as our primarily goal is to be cash balanced. Year-to-date operating expense is also down, down 8% when compared to 2015. And we expect a downward quarterly trend to continue in the second half of this year, as we realize the full-year run rate of organizational actions and supply chain initiatives. Turning to slide 19, just a quick update on our asset sales program. Over the last 10 years, on average we have received proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion per year. With the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia, 2015 was the highest dollar transaction year. Year to date, we have received proceeds of $1.4 billion, covering several transactions, New Zealand marketing, Canadian gas storage assets, pipeline assets in California, and Upstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico. We have a number of potential transactions presently being worked. The larger publicly known transactions are noted on the slide. There are a few attributes that these transactions have in common. The assets are not essential to delivering on our strategy. Their valuations are not particularly oil price sensitive. And there are multiple interested buyers. We believe our sales program is executable, and that we can secure good value. We have confidence in achieving our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next. And as I said last quarter, we have line of sight on around $2 billion for 2016. I'd like to close the presentation here on slide 20 by reiterating a few key points. We remain committed to becoming cash balanced in 2017. Our projects are coming online. And we're making huge strides in lowering our cost structure and getting our capital outflows down. We're on track with our asset sales program. We see those as back-end loaded with more occurring in 2017 than this year. They're eminently doable. We believe they are a realistic part of our cash balancing program. Looking out the next 12 months to 24 months, our profile is just as we have long said it would be; strong volume growth and cash flow margin accretion at the same time. That's a powerful combination, offering tremendous value growth for our shareholders. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're committed to growing the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. We recognize the value our shareholders place on dividend, and the value they place on our long history of annual dividend payment increases. So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Please do keep in mind that we have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and perhaps one follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to get everyone's questions answered. Jonathan, can you please open the line?\nOperator: Certainly, thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Hey, good morning.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nFrank Mount: Hey, Phil.\nJames William Johnson: Good morning.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Thanks for all the color in the slide deck today. My two quick questions are going back to the Analyst Day and then tying it to what you said today. The first one would just be on the production growth outlook, looking out to 2017 in the fuzzy bar chart. At the time, at the Analyst Day you had mentioned that the 2.9 million to 3.0 million [barrels per day] target generally still held at that point in time. Obviously there has been a lot of transitory items this year and then there are some asset sales. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of an update as we look ahead to 2017, either on the number itself or some of the moving pieces we should think about with respect to that number.\nJames William Johnson: So I think as we look forward at the production, the thing that's coming through are the major capital projects. And as they start up and we're seeing good performance out of those, I think that part of our performance is very strong. As is the growth coming from assets like the Permian and our other base business. And actually our decline rates have been very good. We will see potentially some decline. We're expecting to go maybe from the 2% into the 2% to 4% range (sic) [zero to 4% range] because of the cutbacks in capital. But we still see pretty good performance from all of our base assets. The asset sales program, we'll give some further updates when we get to the SAM meeting on where we stand there. Some of those were already baked into that forecast. And of course as we move forward and build a business plan this year, a lot of it's going to be responsive to the environment that we find ourselves as we move forward. I think a key thing is that these new barrels coming online from Permian and from these major capital projects are accretive to our existing portfolio. And so we expect to see strong cash generation as we move forward.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Okay. And then my follow up is just on the Permian. At the Analyst Day you had talked about a potential doubling of the capital budget to meet this strong growth profile through 2020. It sounds like the costs are coming in very well. So maybe just talk about how you think about growth versus capital preservation? If you can do more with less, would you focus on reducing the capital? Or would you try and actually increase this production target over time?\nJames William Johnson: We'll give further updates on our production targets I think at the SAM meeting. But what I would say in the meantime is we continue to want to grow our Permian business. So we are adding an additional rig in August. We expect to have a total of four additional rigs. So that's going from six currently to 10 rigs by the end of this year in the Permian. And would expect to see good performance coming from those rigs. One of the things we've tried to do is take a measured pace, so that we preserve the productivity and the capital efficiency that we've been able to capture so far. We want to make sure we do that as we ramp up. And we feel quite confident we can do so.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Phil.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nPaul Sankey: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nFrank Mount: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: I think I've got the longest term question I've ever asked here, which is the Kazakh concession expires in 2032. Is that correct?\nJames William Johnson: Yes, 2033.\nPaul Sankey: 2033. Is that included in your economic assumptions as a sort of end point for the \u2013 I mean I know it's kind of crazy. But obviously if you're investing for stuff in 2022, 10 years, 11 years is not that much later in terms of the scale of the project. Are the economics that you've run assuming that the concession goes away?\nJames William Johnson: Yeah. We base all of our economics and decision-making on the actual end of life of the concession. But obviously there's considerable upside I think both for the country and for the companies if we continue to progress the concession with an extension.\nPaul Sankey: Got it. Thank you, Jay. Nearer term, were there any special items that we should consider in the cash flow? I asked a similar question to Exxon. That makes this an unrepresentative quarter, because obviously the cash balances right now are not even covering the dividend.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right.\nPaul Sankey: Is there anything special?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, I'd mention two things. I mentioned them in the official comments. One is working capital and the other is deferred tax. And on a year-to-date basis both of them are worth about $2 billion each. From a working capital standpoint, I indicated that we expect a portion of that will reverse this year. The deferred tax impacts will also reverse. And you need to think about these as tax loss carrybacks or tax loss carryforwards. Across the world it depends on specific circumstances and specific jurisdictions what the specifics of that are. But in either case we can either take these back against prior income. Or we can carry them forward against future income. So in our case I know for example, we will be filing for amended tax returns in 2017. So the point is that those negatives, both on working capital and deferred tax, are negatives right now, but they become positives in the future. And so when you think about this impact, and it's pretty significant on a year-to-date basis. Again, $4 billion across the two of those.\nPaul Sankey: Yes.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: When you take that into account and you think about Gorgon and Wheatstone coming online and the $2 a barrel margin accretion that we gave you over the whole portfolio, our outlook on cash flow generation going forward is quite positive.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: Could I just ask a quick follow-up? Sorry. The working capital effect, isn't that from prices going up during the quarter? So wouldn't it \u2013 why would it reverse if prices went further up from here?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: So I mean a part of it is inventory, part of it in this particular time just happened to be cargo timing on receivables versus payables. So we've analyzed it to quite an extent. And we're pretty comfortable saying, somewhere in the neighborhood of at least half of it will go down between now and the end of the year.\nPaul Sankey: Yes.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: We obviously are being impacted by lower activity and then just changes in prices and cost structures.\nPaul Sankey: Thanks, Pat.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nFrank Mount: Hey, Paul.\nJames William Johnson: Hey, Paul.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Jay, two question in here. First, Gorgon Train 2 and 3, previously I think the expectation is that maybe a little bit sooner. Train 2 will be maybe the third quarter and Train 3 will be the first quarter 2017. And also I think that the historical data that you guys are suggesting 3 months to 6 months of the startup period or the ramp-up period. Now talking about 6 months to 8 months. Is that being just conservative on your part? Or that there's something fundamentally when you're looking at the LNG business lead you to believe that the ramp-up period and everything, that may just take a bit longer than historically has been?\nJames William Johnson: Paul, couple things. We've always said that our expectation is that Train 2 and Train 3 would start up at roughly six-month intervals. And we're pretty much still on that plan. We started up the first train in March, so we're projecting early in the fourth quarter for Train 2, and then Train 3 will follow along behind. So there's latitude in those quarters. We are seeing very good construction progress on Train 2 and Train 3. And importantly, all the lessons, as I said, that we've learned, not only during the construction time, but in the design and all the modifications we've had to make, as we've started up Train 1, all that's been built into Train 2 as well as the actual hours to complete these projects. So we feel very encouraged by the results we're seeing. We're happy with the construction progress. We're well into commissioning of Train 2. So there it's pretty much as we expected. As far as the ramp-up, our view has been six to eight months. We base that looking at LNG projects around the world. That's a normal ramp-up period. As I've said before, it's not so much that you're on this smooth curve from startup to full capacity. But as you start up one of these plants, there are issues that have to be dealt with. And so you have periods of downtime, as you go down to make modifications or fix some of the equipment that you have difficulty with on startup, tuning, loops, things like that. So it's really a function of the downtime. And the overall effect is a curve as you approach 100% capacity. So we still expect that six to eight-month ramp-up period. But again with Train 2 and Train 3 and the benefit of the experiences we're gaining on Train 1 \u2013 they're identical designs \u2013 it gives us a little bit of a head start in terms of that ramp-up for the second two trains\nPaul Y. Cheng: Second question on Tengiz future growth project. Maybe I'm wrong, but my current assumption is that if I have, say, $10 on the transportation cost, and 5% is on the price realization to Brent price, and assume a 20 \u2013 there's 18% royalty and 30% income tax, it looks like even at $80 Brent, I only get maybe less than 10% internal rate of return for the full project. I just wanted to see whether you can comment on that, whether that internally that you guys looking for a much better return. And if it's $80, why will you, say, sanction the projects?\nJames William Johnson: So I think our economics are a little bit different than yours, Paul. I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract. But we do see a better rate than what you're seeing. The transportation costs are quite good with CPC. Of course with FGP, some portion of the throughput would have to go by rail. But it's going to be within the envelope of what we've already moved by rail prior to the expansion of CPC. So we're quite comfortable with that. When we look at Gorgon overall \u2013 or sorry, FGP overall, I think there are a couple things in terms of the economics. We have a very good understanding of this reservoir. It's largely been derisked. We've been operating it for 23 years. We have a very strong operating organization and maintenance organization there that's given us very high reliability. So between the good reservoir models and our understanding of that reservoir as well as the operation and reliability we get from the facilities, this is a very good project for us in terms of the scale and the amount of capacity it adds. We also see that the market conditions right now are favorable and the project is ready for execution. As we've talked about, the engineering is well advanced, over 50%. The procurement is 67%. We have a very good understanding of what it's going to take to execute this project. And we've got a lot of the infrastructure already in place because effectively this builds on the infrastructure that's already in Tengiz. So we see it as a relatively low-risk project from all those factors. In terms of the opportunities though, we see a lot of upside opportunity. We've done a great job in the past at Tengiz, and we've really got a proven track record of extracting incremental value out of the infrastructure once it's installed. If you look at SGP, for example, the second generation plant, that started up in 2008, this really tested the new technology that's being used at FGP. And since startup, we've been able to increase the capacity of that facility by 22% over nameplate, which gives us a lot of incremental capacity. FGP is actually simpler in terms of the processing facilities than SGP, and we would expect to see similar types of upside opportunity. There's also upside when you look at the infill drilling that FGP puts in place. And FGP carries incrementally large gas handling capacity, more than what's required right now. So as the reservoir pressures continue to decline, not only does it help stabilize the platform, but we take that additional gas handling capacity and use it on existing facilities today and help handle that increase in gas/oil ratio into the future. So there's a lot of upside benefits that are yet to come. Of course when we talked about the opportunity for contract extensions, we feel this is good for the company as well as ourselves. Now there are other assessments out there like Wood Mac [Wood Mackenzie]. Many of you may have seen it. There's a number of areas where we see some differences in our view and their view. As I said, we have a very well-matched accurate reservoir model, history match model. We have a faster ramp-up on the project after completion. We also have a faster decline on the reservoir if we weren't doing the project than what Wood Mac is counting on. Both of those would drive value into the project. And finally, Wood Mac has almost twice as many wells in their forecast than we carry in our development plan. So those are some key differences I would point out as well as some of the upside potential we see with this project.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Thank you.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nFrank Mount: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: I wonder if I could have one for \u2013 thanks. I wonder if I could \u2013 one for Pat and one for Jay. Pat, I'm not quite sure how to ask this one, but it's a follow-up to Paul's question about deferred tax. One of your competitors, ConocoPhillips, gave some sensitivities about what the impact of deferred tax is. It's quite meaningful. They say on earnings, every $10 is like $1.5 billion on cash flow. However, up to a certain level, like $60 oil, it's about $2.5 billion for every $10. I'm guessing it's the same kind of thing you're getting at. I'm wondering if you could give some sensitivities around just exactly that issue. Because obviously the deferred tax credit back could be quite material.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Doug, it's a great question. I'm not prepared here to give you a sensitivity around it. It is one of the primary areas of exploration, I would say, as we go through our business planning cycle here over the next couple of months. It's a critical element for us to understand jurisdiction by jurisdiction what the price sensitivity is over a variety of price levels. And so it's something I don't have today, but it's something we are investigating ourselves. And in the future we'd be in a better place, off of this current business plan that we're putting together, to be able to address that question.\nDoug Leggate: My guess \u2013 this is an observation. But my guess is, including myself, a lot of folks are scrambling to understand that. Because I think it could be a big delta on folks' expectations of your future cash flow. My follow up is really for Jay. And I don't know to what extent you can answer this, Jay. But my understanding is John [Watson] was recently in New York over the last several months and was talking about the longer-term spending restrictions if you like, or the level at which he expects to see, beyond your current five-year planning horizon. And more importantly had indicated that the unconventional portfolio could really become a very large part, like 25% of the company by the middle of the next decade. I'm just wondering if you can frame that in terms of implications for additional long cycle projects, and whether my understanding of that is accurate.\nJames William Johnson: I think John's comments about unconventional becoming a larger and larger part of our company are valid. We gave you a capital range of $17 billion to $22 billion for next year. We have both TCO and expansion of our unconventional built into that number already. We're actually getting very granular in our planning of capital allocation across all the assets in the company. And making sure that that capital is flowing to where we expect to get the highest return. Unconventional, with the de-risking that we've been able to do in \u2013 particularly in the Permian. And then the way we're using best practice in one field to spread to all the others we have \u2013 the Marcellus, the Permian, the Duvernay, Vaca Muerta \u2013 is really showing benefits right across our unconventional portfolio. And we're quite excited about the role this is going to play going forward. As to large major capital projects, we will still have some. That's an important part of our portfolio. But we're going to take a measured approach to these. We're only going to be approving the ones that represent the best value for us. And it's going to be in balance with the other opportunities we have, as we maintain a very disciplined capital program going forward.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: To be clear, Jay, just a point of clarification. That 25% number is broadly right. But it's a global number, not a U.S. number?\nFrank Mount: Yes.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes.\nJames William Johnson: Yes.\nDoug Leggate: Great. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please.\nBlake Fernandez: Folks, good morning.\nFrank Mount: Good morning, Blake.\nBlake Fernandez: Jay, I realize you went through the execution readiness on Tengiz. I guess my question is really around the potential for that $6.2 billion of contingency to maybe not even come in at that level. I mean I realize you're pretty well along on several fronts. But is there an opportunity to lock in costs at this point? And I guess I'm just trying to understand, is there a potential to mitigate the risk of that $6.2 billion coming to fruition?\nJames William Johnson: Absolutely there's a chance to mitigate the risk. I mean what we've really tried to do is both be reasonable and as practical \u2013 realistic I should say \u2013 in our view of what contingency is required on these very large projects. And this is based on our past, but also the industry experience in executing these projects. But then what we've tried to do is take our experience on other very large projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone, as well as projects we've done in Tengiz, and build those in. We've looked ahead and said, these are the areas that cause us difficulty on these projects. And we've tried to mitigate each one of those. And I won't go through them in detail again. They're in the slides. I've talked about them before. But engineering represents one of the biggest challenges. And our work to advance the engineering before FID, but also advance the engineering before we start the execution. Before we cut the first steel for any of the fabrication, our models will be complete and at the 90% point, and design assurance verified before we start any of the actual fabrication work on facilities. And we've done a tremendous amount of work on the design assurance reviews. And we're working to make sure the procurement is advanced, so that when we start the execution in the field, we know that we'll be able to move through that execution smoothly and in sequence. We think all these brought together along with our experience in Kazakhstan is going to help us really stay focused on mitigating any use of that contingency. Contingency is expected to be used. What we're trying to do is reduce the risk and uncertainty, so that we can minimize how much of it we do have to use.\nBlake Fernandez: Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Blake.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Yes. Good morning. I guess first question just around CapEx and OpEx. You've been making some good progress. And you've got these downward arrows suggesting that in the second half of the year we'll still see further progress. I'm just wondering, maybe just give us an update as perhaps where OpEx and SG&A, where the new bottom of that cost structure could get to?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I think on the capital side, we've given you everything that we anticipate at this point in time. Right now we're sitting at the midway part of the year, trending on, yeah, $25 billion sort of range. We think that's where we could end, possibly a little bit lower than that. We're actually trending on $24 billion at the 6-month mark, but we're thinking $25 billion might be \u2013 sorry. $24 billion may be where we end the year. So somewhere between $24 billion and $25 billion I think is the appropriate level for you to think about. And then in terms of 2017 and 2018, we've given you the range there of the $17 billion to $22 billion. But obviously we need to be market responsive. And so right now we're thinking it's towards the lower end of that range. And if in fact the market doesn't move prices anywhere off of where they are today, we'll probably be lower than that. Or certainly at the very low end of that range. So that's as much guidance as I can give you on capital at the moment. We're rolling up the business plans. And we'll have more to say as we get towards the end of the year. On operating expense our target really \u2013 we came down on operating expense $2 billion between 2014 and 2015. And our target is to come down another $2 billion between 2015 and 2016. We have a number of organizational impacts that have occurred through the first half of this year, but there will be more that will come in the second half of this year. And we also continue to work through the supply chain. We've got another set of targets internally for continued effort to reduce costs through the supply chain. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) And then a question for Jay. One of the criticisms I guess with the majors, which you addressed in slide 12 on the Permian, is the relative costs and the EURs. I mean you have \u2013 I think last year at the Analyst Day, what did I see? It was $7.1 million. And now you're talking about some of the average wells in some of the plays being $5.6 million. And your EURs I think at the Analyst Day were I guess 960 million [BOE] in the Delaware and 850 million [BOE] in the Midland. But obviously the purer plays who've been able to I guess get out on the front foot in terms of press releases are doing a lot of work with completion technology to boost EUR. So maybe just give us some color as to how you see your competitive positioning relative to I guess a lot of the people who are just the other side of the gate? And even in some of the same wells as you?\nJames William Johnson: I think we're now fully competitive with these other players. And we may not be flashy, but we're steady. We have taken all these learnings in. We've been very methodical in our approach and very systematic. Our goal as I said before is to be fully competitive on an operating basis, so that when you add in the advantaged royalty position, it gives us a clear incremental value proposition over competitors. We'll continue to stay focused on this. And as I said we're ramping up the number of company operated rigs. But we're going to do so in a manner that allows us to maintain those efficiencies. The one other thing I'd say is that our current view is that we're building infrastructure into some of these initial development projects. And as that infrastructure comes into play, it provides a solid foundation for us to continue to incrementally improve economics as we move forward. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Thank you.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\nDouglas Terreson: Good morning, everybody.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nFrank Mount: Good morning.\nDouglas Terreson: Pat, a few of your competitors recently committed to new capital management plans and performance metrics, by which they plan to be held accountable in the future. And on this point you guys have had a pathway to improve returns in your materials for a few quarters now. And you've clearly made progress on the cost side based on today's results in I think it was Slide 18 or so. So my question is, if oil prices and financial performance recover in 2016 and 2017, can you envision a scenario whereby your financial priorities might shift for an intermediate term period? Let's say a return of capital to shareholders having greater priority than spending for instance. Or do you feel that between the cyclical timing and the low costs that we have today and the quality of your portfolio, that higher spending would almost surely be in the best interest of shareholders? So the question is about how you weigh these different financial options in the recovery scenario?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Doug, we've had the same financial priorities for a long period of time. Dividend return to shareholders being first, and then reinvestment in the business second, and then having a prudent financial structure being third. And I don't see those priorities changing going forward. We're going to obviously work to balance those priorities under the circumstances that are presented to us.\nDouglas Terreson: Sure.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I do think \u2013 I don't see that there's significant \u2013 see any increases coming for us. I think we're going to increase our dividend when cash flow permits it. We're going to make the investment profile that we've talked about, where we're moving to shorter cycle, higher return projects. And not as many of the long duration lower return projects. FGP/WPMP is the only significant project that we have taken FID. We do see additional major capital projects in our future. But they're not going to come with the same pace that we have had most recently here. We want to be much more ratable and predictable in our capital program. And we are going to have to take some of the cash that we're generating in the future and use it to restore our balance sheet\nDouglas Terreson: Sure. So thanks for the clarity and the update.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Doug.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nNeil Mehta: Hey. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to get an update on two areas of disrupted production. First is the Neutral Zone, and the second is Nigeria, recognizing the latter could have some sensitivities. What update can you provide on the return to production?\nJames William Johnson: So in the Partitioned Zone, this is really an issue between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. They continue to engage to work this forward. Our view is that we would like to see a return to production. That's what we advocate. But in the meantime what we've done are two things. We've tried to bring all the preservation work and maintain the field in a state of readiness, so it can be restarted. We've also done quite a bit of work to understand and use the opportunity with our technical people to model the entire field and look for efficiencies that we can build into this field when it restarts. And we've been quite successful in some of the planning that we'd have for the restart. We've also been bringing our cost structures down. And there will be more of that to come as this continues forward. In terms of Nigeria, this is an area where we've operated for a long time. There are some issues there. The government is working these issues. Our priority is on protecting people and making sure that we protect our operations. But I really won't say too much more about it, other than this is an issue that continues to be addressed by the government\nNeil Mehta: And if I can ask a quick follow-up here. Pat, on your comments on return of capital. For the last two decades to three decades you've raised the dividend every year. Are you still on track to do that in 2016? And just if you can comment on the broader strategy around dividend growth?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. What I can say is that we're fully aware of the 28-year annual dividend payment increase. We're also fully aware that an increase needs to occur in 2016 if we are to keep that pattern alive. The board fully understands the value of the dividend increase and they understand the value of growing the dividend over time. So the board will be looking at cash generation and our ability from a sustainable sense to support a higher dividend going forward. I guess I would just reiterate. We do see our cash flow circumstance improving over time here. We've got the confidence in our future growth, in production. We've got confidence in our future cash generation. I'll take you back to the $2 per barrel margin increase that we showed at the security Analyst Day on the portfolio. Assuming flat commodity prices, that's the margin accretion that we get out of these LNG projects predominantly. It raises the cash margin on the entire portfolio. And we also believe that we can compete very successfully and sustainably over time here with a much lower capital program because we've got assets, for example, like the Permian and other unconventionals. So we feel very comfortable about what our future holds.\nNeil Mehta: Great. Thanks, guys.\nFrank Mount: Thanks very much, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nEvan Calio: Hi. I guess good afternoon, everybody.\nFrank Mount: Hi, Evan.\nEvan Calio: Jay, maybe a follow up on Paul's prior question on Tengiz. It really gets to this concern that it's a lower return project, given future lease expiry or otherwise. I'm not really asking for confidential terms. But can you share any expected project return at sanction? Or how it compared to other projects, while gating in the portfolio even maybe by tier?\nJames William Johnson: I can't really get into divulging our economics and our view of it other than to say we have been very disciplined in our capital. We're putting that capital where we believe it's going to give us a good return. We look at a lot of things when we consider the performance of a project. And part of it is the risk we're taking on as well as the potential for additional upside to be gained, and I talked about those earlier. Ultimately, the economic value of this project will be a function of the prices realized over the period of time between now and the end of the concession. But we're taking a lot of steps to make sure that we're building as much value into this as we can. We see it as an attractive project.\nEvan Calio: Great, maybe just a brief follow-up if I could. What is the percentage of total project financing targeted here, just to help better understand what the future cash flow, at least out the door, look like?\nJames William Johnson: The financing is really in place as an assist. The entire project is not being funded by the financing. We have a combination of co-lending, we have a bank facility, and we have the bond issuance. So that combination coupled with the cash generation of TCO, which is actually quite strong, should provide sufficient funding for the project as well as ongoing value to the shareholders.\nEvan Calio: Thanks. I appreciate it, guys.\nFrank Mount: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nRyan Todd: Great, thanks, maybe one follow-up on the Permian. You have a chart there on the slides, which I think is again relative to the Analyst Day presentation, showing the multiyear outlook for growth in the Permian. If you think about the assumptions that are in that chart, both in terms of activity levels and well performance, how would you say that things are trending in the basin right now relative to your assumptions there? Are the wells performing better than assumed in the base case there, activity levels similar? And where would the bias be? Is there an upwards or downward bias do you think for that multiyear outlook?\nJames William Johnson: So you can see the red line shows where we actually are relative to that view, and we're on plan with the initial growth there. And as we said, we saw over 20% growth in the Permian relative to last year. Now that's done even with less rigs. We're running about the same number of rigs we expected on the company side. Our non-operated rigs are actually less. But we're actually accomplishing our objectives with fewer rigs. We're going to be going from six rigs to 10 rigs by the end of this year. So we're staffing up and ramping up our activity level. I would say the bias on this is upward going forward.\nRyan Todd: Okay, thanks. And then maybe if I could switch gears to the Gulf of Mexico, you've had a number of different projects in various stages of appraisal or development there. Any thoughts on how those resources are shaking up where the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 how you see those types of projects stacking up potentially within your portfolio going forward? And maybe one specific one, one of your partners that was in the joint development project I think for Tiber-Guadalupe-Gibson and those recently impaired leases in those fields, is that project still on plan going forward, or is that one that you guys may be walking away from?\nJames William Johnson: So I think of the projects in two categories. We've got an existing set of deepwater projects that are already in operation in the Gulf of Mexico, and they are very profitable. And more than that, they provide a good platform for additional investment, as we talked about earlier in the presentation. Going forward, the key really is getting our development cost down, and we're very focused on doing that in a couple of ways. Our deepwater drilling has improved fairly substantially. If you look at just in the last year or so, we've seen 30% faster drilling rates in the deepwater. And with the cost of rigs, that has a big impact. As we move forward, we expect to see our rig costs go down as well as the rates of drilling progress go up. We're also looking at the facilities and getting them right-sized. What I mean by that is rather than chasing for peak production, for example, we may go with smaller facilities that have a longer plateau of production, higher capital efficiency. So as we look at driving the cost per barrel and the development costs down, I think that's what's going to be required for new projects to be competitive with other opportunities in our portfolio. Once these projects are on, they have relatively low operating costs. We get good margins out of them. It's just the time between the initial exploration program and development wells and ultimately the production that burdens these projects from an overall financial return standpoint. In terms of the Tiber that you asked about, this project is still under assessment. I really don't really want to comment too much further, but we're evaluating it. There may be some additional appraisal work to do, and then we'll be putting that against some of the other opportunities that we have. We do think the deepwater represents a good resource base, and it is important for meeting global demand in the future. So we think production from this area will continue. But as I said, our focus is on driving those development costs down so that these projects are competitive with other opportunities in the portfolio.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Ryan.\nRyan Todd: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nRoger D. Read: Thanks, good morning.\nJames William Johnson: Good morning.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nFrank Mount: Good morning.\nRoger D. Read: I guess just a quick kind of follow-up on the CapEx side. So looked like you're going to underspend this year potentially, at least on track for it. And you think about the guidance for $17 billion to $22 billion over the next couple years. Should we think about the benefits this year are something that are transitory? Or something that are looking a little more permanent? And then maybe either get more for $17 billion to $22 billion? Or you can potentially underspend $17 billion to $22 billion as we think about the next 3 years?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Roger, I think one of the primary drivers in moving from the 2016 circumstance to 2017 and beyond is the trailing off of these projects under construction. I mean just the LNG projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone, for example. I mean that is a significant reason behind the drop-off in the capital spending between the years. But also going forward, as we've talked about the portfolio shift that we have, where we have a lot more of our future investment coming forward in this shorter cycle Permian based activity, as opposed to the long cycle and large duration major capital projects, that's really what drives the change in the absolute level of spending. We've made a commitment as well. There's an affordability component here. We've made a commitment as well to get cash balanced in 2017. And because of the opportunity that we've got both in the brownfield extensions as well as in the Permian unconventional like activity, we believe we've got a very competitive capital program at a $17 billion range. So I think of it as being a sustainable sort of capital level under prices that we have today.\nRoger D. Read: Right, I understood sustainability. I was more just trying to understand of \u2013 is the fact that you're tracking under the $25 billion due I guess more to the large projects that do come to an end? Or are you seeing an actual improvement in sort of underlying spending, service costs, equipment costs, whatever they are? Trying to think about it, is $17 billion to $22 billion, should it really be maybe $15.5 billion to, say, $20 billion, or something like that?\nJames William Johnson: Building on what Pat said...\nRoger D. Read: On an apples-to-apples comparison.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes.\nJames William Johnson: Yes, building on what Pat said, I think there's a lot of things that drive capital spending. And it can be everything from our current price environment to foreign exchange rates. But what we've really focused on in this near term have been two things. One is driving down the pricing from our vendors and contractors. That's probably more transitory. But we've also been very focused on building efficiency in how we conduct our operations. And we've talked about that in previous calls and at the SAM meeting. That work continues across the business. And as we drive more and more efficiency into our spend, we own that. We'll be able to retain that going forward. I think the other big area for us is improving the execution of projects. And it's partly doing things better internally. And I've talked about what those things are. They're on that slide. But it's also taking advantage of market conditions like we're in now, where we can get the best yards working on our projects. We're not competing for yard resources and contractor capabilities. We can get the A team on these projects. And that really helps us execute better. And that's sustainable through this period.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Roger.\nRoger D. Read: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please?\nFrank Mount: Hi, Brad.\nBrad Heffern: Hi, everyone.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Hi.\nBrad Heffern: I know we're past the top of the hour, so I'll keep it short. I was just curious on the impairment commentary in the prepared remarks, I think weaker reservoir performance was mentioned. Obviously we're all used to seeing price related impairments at this point. But I was curious if you could put a finer point on what assets that related to? Is it all legacy stuff? Or is it anything from major projects over the past few years?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. I mean there were multiple assets involved. But the largest single contributor here was Papa-Terra in Brazil.\nJames William Johnson: Yeah. So Papa-Terra is one where we've been disappointed in the performance of this asset. We have gone ahead and seconded a number of our Chevron people into the operators' team. We're working with the operator to determine not only what is happening with the reservoir, but also where we go from here. So we'll give you more update at some point in the future. But at this point in time it's largely around Papa-Terra and the performance.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Brad.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. I think that wraps us up for the conference call here for the second quarter. I appreciate everybody's interest in Chevron and appreciate your questions in particular. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect. Good day."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-04-29 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right, thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Joe Geagea, Executive Vice President of Technology, Projects, and Services. Many of you know Joe. But for those of you who don't, I thought it would be useful to highlight that he leads our technology, procurement, and project functions. He also oversees our centers for excellence for upstream, including drilling. Also joining me on the call is Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two. I'll begin with key messages from our March 2016 security analyst meeting, followed by a recap of our first quarter 2016 financial results. Joe will provide some color around our spend reduction initiatives and discuss recent updates on key projects prior to my concluding remarks. Turning now to slide three, our Analyst Day was about seven weeks ago now, and I thought it would be worthwhile to reiterate the primary messages from that series of sessions. Preserving and growing the dividend is our first priority. Our intention is to be able to cover the dividend in 2017. Our capital spend profile is coming down. We are completing major capital projects already under construction but otherwise reducing long-cycle spend. We are lowering our cost structure to better match a low price environment by improving efficiencies, streamlining the organization, and working with suppliers to achieve cost reductions. At the same time, we expect our cash inflows to be growing. Production increases will occur as we bring on and ramp up projects. While volume growth is sensitive to any number of unknowns, such as prices, divestments, ramp-up profiles, we anticipate volume growth through the end of the decade using reasonable estimates for these and other uncertainties. The cash generation of the new assets coming online is substantial, to the point where these production adds are expected to raise the overall cash margin per barrel of the entire portfolio, even absent any increase in price. This year, we plan to use some of our borrowing capacity to complete projects. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, and we believe we can come through the lows of this price cycle with long-term financial strength intact. Our investment will shift to a higher proportion of short-cycle projects. Not only are many of these brownfield opportunities, but they will give us greater capital flexibility going forward to help limit further debt increases. Finally, we are focused on improving financial returns, reducing pre-productive capital, moving towards more short-cycle higher-return investments, lowering our cost structure, and improving execution on major capital projects. Turning to slide four, an overview of our financial performance; the company's first quarter loss was $725 million or negative $0.39 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and special items, as detailed in an appendix slide, the loss for the quarter totaled $211 million or negative $0.11 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 22%. Our net debt ratio was 18%. During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield 4.2%. Turning to slide five, cash generated from operations was $1.1 billion during the first quarter. Obviously, upstream cash generation has been heavily penalized by low commodity prices. Downstream continues to generate strong cash flow, although seasonal patterns are evident. During the quarter, operating cash flow reflected about $1 billion of working capital requirements as well as certain pension contributions. In addition, affiliate dividends were modest in the quarter, a pattern that is clearly price-related. And we expect cash generation to improve going forward as our costs come down and as prices move up. Cash capital expenditures were $5.6 billion, a decrease of approximately 27% from first quarter 2015. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $8.9 billion, and our net debt position was about $33 billion. Turn to slide six, slide six compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2016 results were $3.3 billion lower than first quarter 2015 results. About half of this quarter-on-quarter decline was in special items and foreign exchange. Overall, special items accounted for a negative variance between quarters of $755 million, the bulk of which related to last year's recognition of both asset sale gains and the favorable impact of changes in UK petroleum tax regulations. A swing in foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $900 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. Excluding special items and foreign exchange, upstream earnings decreased approximately $1.6 billion between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower operating and exploration expenses. The realization change was in line with our sensitivity of $350 million per $1 change in Brent. Downstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by approximately $475 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins. The variance in the other segment was primarily from lower corporate tax items. Turning to slide seven, I'll now compare results for the first quarter 2016 with the fourth quarter 2015. First quarter results were $137 million lower than fourth quarter. A swing in special items, mainly the absence of fourth quarter's impairment and project suspension charges, increased earnings by $930 million. Foreign exchange impacts went the other way, decreasing earnings by $365 million between periods. Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by approximately $750 million between quarters, primarily reflecting lower realizations, again in line with our sensitivity. Downstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange were lower by $163 million. Weaker refining margins were partially offset by stronger trading results, lower operating expenses, and the absence of year-end inventory charges from a draw into higher-cost prior-year layers. The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges. Slide eight compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 7,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital project ramp-ups, primarily at Gorgon in Australia, Chuandongbei in China, and Lianzi and Moho Nord in West Africa, increased production by 11,000 barrels per day. The absence of planned and unplanned downtime, mainly at Tengiz in Kazakhstan, increased production by 25,000 barrels per day between periods. Shale and tight production declined 5,000 barrels a day between quarters, as external constraints such as weather impacts and downtime at a third-party processing facility impacted the Permian. Price and cost recovery effects associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts decreased production by 18,000 barrels per day between quarters, as lower crude prices were more than offset by the impact from lower spend on cost recovery. The remaining variance in the base business and other bar primarily reflects natural field declines and other adjustments. All this said, first quarter volumes are up about 2% from full-year 2015 production. This is right in the middle of the guidance range we provided in January and reaffirmed in March. We still believe this guidance is appropriate. Slide nine compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 15,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 38,000 barrels per day, primarily due to production ramp-ups from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Bangladesh, and West Africa, in addition to startups at Gorgon in Australia and Chuandongbei in China. Shale and tight production increased by 37,000 barrels per day due to the growth in the Permian and Marcellus in the U.S. and the Liard and Duvernay basins in Canada. Volumes associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts increased production by 16,000 barrels per day, as the positive impact from lower crude prices was partially offset by the impacts of lower spending on cost recovery. The shut-in of operations in the Partitioned Zone decreased production by approximately 76,000 barrels per day. The decrease of 30,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects normal field declines and higher downtime activity, partially offset by production from new wells and favorable impact from reduced external constraints. Turning now to slide 10, we are making good progress at reducing our spend. These charts use a rolling four-quarter average to illustrate capital and operating expense reductions. When comparing the rolling four-quarter average of first quarter 2016 to the same period of the prior year, capital outlays are down 19%. In December, we announced a C&E program of $26.6 billion for the year. But as we noted in March, we are now targeting closer to $25 billion for the year. As we continue to finish major capital projects under construction, we will move to an absolute lower level of annual spend in future years, as evidenced by our $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you for 2017 to 2018. Affordability considerations at the time will be paramount in determining actual budgets. Capital intensity will be going down. Capital discipline will be going up. You see the same downward pattern on operating expense. Expenses continued to rise through 2014, but then notably turned south in mid-2015, as our deliberate cost savings initiatives began to take hold. The rolling first quarter 2016 average is 6% lower than the comparable figure a year ago. There are some transitional costs such as severance and rig termination fees that are incurred as we take steps to compete more effectively in a lower price environment. Once we're through with the transition costs and as we carry on with the implementation of our various cost savings initiatives, we expect to see continued movement towards a lower sustainable cost structure. Cost reduction momentum should continue through 2016 and 2017, as the full run rate of our actions is recognized. Joe will now walk you through some specific examples of our cost reduction efforts before offering an update on key projects.\nJoseph C. Geagea: Thank you, Pat. Turning to slide 11, I'll start by providing some examples in support of Pat's analysis. Our efforts have focused on achieving sustainable reductions and improving efficiencies. On the organizational side, to date we have reduced our employee head count by more than 4,000 relative to year end 2014, and we are on target to achieve approximately 8,000 total employee reductions by the end of 2016. We're also on target to reduce our contractor workforce by about 6,500 from 2014 levels. At the analyst meeting, we shared with you examples of our improved drilling efficiencies in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico, so today let me give you an additional example from a different region of the world. In Thailand, operational discipline and streamlined processes have enhanced drilling execution efficiency, resulting in about 45% lower average days per 10,000 feet drilled in a two-year period, as you can see in the graph. And we are continuing to outperform our regional competitors. We're also focused on improving our efficiencies and logistics. One example in West Africa includes shifting from department dedicated vessels to a centrally-managed fleet using a decision support center. As a result of this effort, we expect to achieve savings of 30% and reduce the number of vessels in that region by about 40%. We're also continuing to take advantage of our size and scale. In a different part of the world, we are coordinating contract awards with one supplier across three different regions and reducing the number of vessels by optimizing marine vessel size. One of our focus areas is to retain gains achieved during this industry downturn. We are doing this across the globe. For example, in one region we are taking advantage of the current downturn to negotiate with our main supplier, lock in lower rates through 2022, and upgrade with newer and more capable equipment. It not only improved our rates but is also expected to improve our reliability. As we look ahead in the supply chain, we see opportunities for more strategic supplier relationships and standardization. At the analyst meeting, we shared with you the cost savings achieved in the oil field tubulars category. These reductions were achieved through standardization and supplier rationalization, where we went from having 35 suppliers in the past to four going forward. On Gorgon, we have worked to standardize and intend to replicate subsea equipment, generating procurement and installation efficiencies as well as considerable cost savings. And lastly, we've been working at standardizing the valves for some time, and we will start deploying these standard valves on future projects. Turning to slide 12, let me give you some project updates. At Gorgon, we commenced LNG production on March 7. We ramped up total production to approximately 90,000 barrels per day, and we shipped the first cargo on March 21. Since late March, we have incurred downtime at the plant due to mechanical issues with the propane refrigerant circuit of Train 1. Repairs to this equipment are nearing completion, and we are in the process of reinstating the propane refrigerant circuit. We expect to restart Train 1 in the next few weeks and resume LNG production within the 30 to 60-day estimate we provided previously. We still expect to achieve Train 1 ramp-up within the previous guidance of six to eight months from initial startup. Construction on Train 2 and Train 3 is progressing as planned, and we anticipate these trains being ready for startup at roughly six-month intervals. Turning to slide 13, at Wheatstone, all nine development wells are completed. We expect to release the drilling rig in the next few months following well cleanup activities. Offshore platform hookup and commissioning is progressing on track, with this work expected to be complete well in advance of plant startup. At the plant site, piping, electrical, and instrumentation work is progressing well. Our plan reflects observed performance rates on other Australian LNG projects. Actual rates are currently on track with our plan, and the outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. Train 2 construction work is also progressing on schedule. Twelve of 24 process modules required for Train 2 startup are now on site and module deliveries are meeting scheduled milestones. Turning to slide 14, I'd like to share brief updates on the other projects which we are expecting to start up this year. At Angola LNG, gas has been introduced into the plant and the team is working through the startup process, with dehydration ongoing ahead of commencing liquefaction. We expect LNG production imminently and anticipate shipping the next cargo in May. At Mafumeira Sul, hookup and commissioning is ongoing. All structures, topsides, and pipelines are installed and the living quarters platform is now occupied, enabling increased manpower on piping, electrical, and commissioning work. Batch drilling of the first 10 wells is complete and first production is expected later this year. At Chuandongbei, Train 1 started up in January, and we were able to ramp up to full capacity within 30 days. Train 2 came online in early April, and ramp up is in progress. We expect to start Train 3 this quarter. At Alder, topsides have been installed and subsea installation work is progressing. At Bangka, well completions are currently ongoing. First production is expected from both these projects later this year. Pat will now share an update on our asset sales program.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right, thanks Joe. Turning to slide 15, asset sales are a routine part of our business. They generate needed cash and they enable a more strategic, effective, and capital-efficient portfolio. Over the next two years, we are targeting $5 billion to $10 billion in sales proceeds. The assets targeted for sale are marketable, and we believe the prospective transactions are executable as well. We generally do not discuss specific assets targeted for sale until we have a transaction. However, there has been growing media coverage since our Analyst Day on a few of these prospective sales, and as such we wanted to provide updates where possible. The chart highlights some specific transactions that are in the public domain. You will note the vast majority of these are not oil price sensitive, and thus we expect to be able to obtain good value on the sales. There were no significant transactions in the first quarter, but activity has picked up in the second quarter. Already known second quarter transactions include the sale of our interest in two gas storage facilities in Western Canada, the sale of our KLM pipeline and Western San Joaquin crude oil pipelines in California, and the divestiture of 19 fields and associated assets located primarily in the Gulf of Mexico Outer Shelf and in Louisiana state waters. In 2015, we signed an agreement to sell our New Zealand downstream operations, subject to certain regulatory approvals. Those regulatory approvals were received yesterday, and we now anticipate final closing midyear. Just last week, we reached an agreement to sell our assets in Hawaii. The sale includes the 58,000 barrel per day refinery, interest in a 58-site branded service station network, four product distribution terminals, pipeline systems, and other downstream-related assets. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the second half 2016. In addition, we are soliciting interest to sell our 75% shareholding in South Africa downstream. We are also exploring potential interest in our geothermal business and Myanmar upstream assets. In aggregate, while it's always difficult to be precise about specific timing, we currently have line of sight on around $2 billion in proceeds, maybe a little higher, for 2016. And because we have multiple transactions in the queue, including those not highlighted on the slide, we have confidence in achieving our two-year $5 billion to $10 billion target. Turning to slide 16, I'd like to close with another slide from our recent investor sessions. It's an illustration of how we get cash balanced next year. In this slide, we used $52 Brent, as it was the actual average price in 2015 and in line with average sell-side analyst price targets for 2017. However, we are committed to balancing at any reasonable price. Spending will come down significantly this year and next, as major development projects get finished and come online, as we high-grade future investments to shorter-cycle, higher-return opportunities, and as we get more efficient and lower our cost structure. Cash generation will grow, not only because of more production, but also because of accretive cash margins on the new production. We'll continue to streamline the portfolio. In short, we are taking the steps necessary to compete in a lower-price environment. If a lower-price environment persists for longer, we will adjust and pursue even more significant cost savings and even greater cuts in capital to continue to lower our cash flow breakeven. We intend to be a resilient competitor regardless of the price environment. Okay, that concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we have a lot of folks trying to get questions in, so please limit yourself to one question and perhaps one follow-up if that's necessary. We'll do our best to get all your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nNeil Mehta: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJoseph C. Geagea: Good morning, Neil.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Hi, Neil.\nNeil Mehta: So just, Pat, I wanted to start off on dividend growth and just your thoughts on raising the dividend in 2016. Is that still a priority for the company? And then how we should think about timing.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Sure, yes. Sustaining and growing the dividend is still the first priority from a cash use standpoint for the corporation. It long has been, and it continues to be. Obviously, our immediate financial environment makes this challenging. We have long said that we'll raise the dividend when our cash flow and our earnings allow it to be sustained. And obviously in first quarter, that was not the circumstances that we found ourselves in, and therefore a deferral was prudent. I think going forward, the timing will obviously be dependent upon future cash, future earnings, what happens to price, what happens to our project ramp-ups, how all that plays out in future quarters. We'll also have to take a look at what we think is happening to commodity prices over a longer sweep of time because, again, we're looking at a dividend as being essentially a commitment in perpetuity. We're very aware of our 28-year record of consecutive annual per share payment increases, and that will be taken into account. So the board will take all this into account as it looks at dividends each and every quarter.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question, please.\nBlake Fernandez: Folks, good morning. When I look at the composition of the upstream earnings, it seems like the U.S. screams kind of lackluster compared to the international component, and to me that's a proxy for short-cycle versus long-cycle. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how you envision the economics there changing as far as short-cycle maybe improving relative to long-cycle longer term.\nJoseph C. Geagea: Okay, let me start by restating that prices were very low in the first quarter. As Pat mentioned, there were a number of one-time events in the first quarter which adversely impacted our production. Now going forward, we still expect to realize the growth range we provided at our analyst meeting. The key for us is to really exercise the things within our control, and that is to continue to drive costs down and to improve our efficiencies. And we have given several proof points in the past about how much progress we've done in that regard. We're now in full horizontal factory mode in the Permian. We've brought our well cost down by about 40%. And we have about 4,000 well locations that offer us a 10% rate of return at around $50 WTI. And when you add on top of all of that the royalty advantage that we have, we see our activity in the Permian as being very, very strong. So the key for us is to continue to be competitive, and we do that very well because we also have NOJV, so we have a good line of sight on how well other people are operating in the basin, and of course we screen and base our own economics. And lastly, the royalty advantage gives us a tremendous boost here.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Blake.\nBlake Fernandez: Thank you.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I'd just like to add too that as we lower our operating expenses from a corporate standpoint as well as in terms of organizational efficiencies, you're going to continue to see those benefits come through as well. And I talked earlier about some transitional costs, severance costs being one of those that I would highlight, that impacted the U.S. segment in this particular quarter. And as we move through that, you'll obviously have stronger earnings once those are concluded.\nJoseph C. Geagea: And to support Pat, our costs at the center have gone down by about 20%, and many SBUs in our upstream in particular have gone through tremendous reorganizational changes, and we're going to see the fruit of that over the next few quarters.\nBlake Fernandez: Got it. Thank you very much.\nFrank Mount: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nPaul Sankey: Pat, you provided on slide 16 an illustration of how you can get back to flat with a $52 assumption and an arrow pointing upwards on price recovery. If that arrow was pointing downwards \u2013 and as you mentioned, you had prioritized the dividend and going into further cost savings and further CapEx cuts \u2013 how low could you go on CapEx? Can you give us an idea what the absolute base number is for you guys? Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I think, Paul, I don't want to go to an absolute base number. We've given you a range of $17 billion to $22 billion. And that range really will \u2013 I think the $17 billion number was low given a representative or reasonable set of price expectations. But frankly, if we find ourselves in a different place, affordability is a paramount consideration here for us, and we will continue to prioritize and high-grade our opportunities. Our primary methodology in terms of capital allocation starts from what do we absolutely need to do to maintain reliability, maintain the asset integrity. And after that, after we have concluded what that is for the operation, then we build up our capital program after that, and we have a great deal of flexibility. So each and every one of those layers of additional spend will have significant hurdles that they have to overcome, and affordability becomes an overriding consideration. So we'll continue to manage the capital down commensurate with the price environment. We'll continue to push forward with our asset sales. I mentioned only $2 billion or so line of sight, maybe a little bit more for this year, but we see our way clear to the $5 billion to $10 billion program. And obviously, for us to have confidence in saying it's $5 billion to $10 billion, we've got more lined up behind that because we know not every transaction will be executed in the timeframe that we've outlined. So we feel confident about our ability to get cash balanced at any reasonable price here.\nPaul Sankey: Got it. That first number that you gave, what is that number? That's not $17 billion is it? That's the starting point number. That's the number I'm looking for.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: The $17 billion...\nPaul Sankey: No, you said you started out with...\nPatricia E. Yarrington: It was the bottom range that we gave for C&E prospectively for 2017 to 2018.\nPaul Sankey: But the number that you said you start with is an absolute minimum for integrity. That's the number I'm looking for.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, and we haven't publicized that number. It would be low because it really is just from an asset integrity and asset reliability standpoint. All I can say is the vast majority of our capital program is above that and would give us opportunities for flexibility.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Paul. I appreciate your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse, your question, please. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Great. Good morning, Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Ed.\nFrank Mount: Good morning, Ed. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) So a key message from the Analyst Day was, obviously, as you get these big projects lined up, a shift to shorter-cycle shale, but also monetize the large brownfield opportunity which you already have behind existing facilities that you built, you should be much more capital intensive. That's a good thing. On the other hand, your debt burden is clearly going to be much higher. It depends how long the down cycle lasts. So can you talk a little bit about where you want to end up in terms of debt burden? It's good news that you've talked about extra disposal candidates over and above the $5 billion to $10 billion. But talk through how you're going to get the debt down to a more useful level.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Ed, the way I look at this or the way we look at this really is that, obviously, when you're at the peak of a price cycle, that's when you want to have restored your balance sheet, have an ultra-conservative balance sheet, and that allows you to come through a price downturn. Right now we're sitting at a 22% debt ratio. We showed a slide at the security analyst meeting that said we could take somewhere between $25 billion to $30 billion of incremental debt. That would take us up to about a 30% debt ratio. There's nothing necessarily magic about the 30%. It was just an indicative place to do a measurement, ourselves versus peers. But I would see as you go through the lows of a price cycle, you would expect your debt burden to increase into the 30%-ish range, maybe a little bit higher on a temporary basis. But if you look through the whole cycle, I think a good place for a company like Chevron with projects that we take on, our size, our scale, our scope, would be probably in the low 20% through the cycle. But getting into the 30%-ish range, we could handle that if it's temporary. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) And then a very quick one. Just on the actual quarter, were there any restructuring charges affecting the cash or anything else that we should focus on in terms of the cash generation, or was it more in line with the macro sensitivities that you would have expected?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I would say cash from operations was low this quarter operationally, obviously, because of crude price. But we did have the working capital consumption of about $1 billion. And there were several items that were not particularly ratable. Pension contributions were one of those. Affiliate dividends weren't particularly ratable as well.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Ed. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Great.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, your question, please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, Pat. Good morning, Frank. Good morning, Joe.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Doug.\nFrank Mount: Good morning.\nJoseph C. Geagea: Good morning.\nDoug Leggate: Guys, I guess this is a follow-up to Ed's question because the question that seems to be coming up for a lot of the oil industry right now is when do you start re-upping spending in contrast to when do you \u2013 or how far do you repair your balance sheet? Now obviously, with companies of your size, the issue is long-cycle capital projects. In light of your comments just there, Pat, about the balance sheet getting up into the 30%, should we think about you as in harvest mode until you get that balance sheet back to where you want it to be? And I wonder if you could just characterize for us what your appetite is for large-scale new project sanctions. And obviously, at the top of my mind is Tengiz.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I'd just go back to our cash flow priorities. Dividend is number one, reinvesting in the business number two. And then prudent financial structure, strong balance sheet is number three. By virtue of the opportunities we have ahead of us in terms of moving towards more short-cycle, frankly, all of the advantages that we have in the Permian, we have growing capital flexibility. So we will see shorter cycle movement there, and that obviously puts less of a strain on your balance sheet because you can adjust those as conditions permit. But we are going to continue to go forward with major capital projects, and FGP [Future Growth Project] is the poster child for that. That's an important project for us, an economic project for us to go forward with. And we will continue to do those. So I think of it as being over time a better balance between short-cycle opportunities and long-cycle opportunities. We're coming off a period that was significantly weighted by long duration, highly capital-intensive projects, and we're moving the portfolio now, our investments now, to a better balance between those. So I think we've got a tremendous amount of flexibility to not only reinvest in the business in short-cycle, take on selective, high-graded, wonderful projects like FGP, but also then have opportunity to restore the balance sheet.\nDoug Leggate: Okay, thanks for the answer, Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Those balancing activities, that will all be part of our balancing considerations as we go forward.\nDoug Leggate: So there is no debt target as such then?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: There is no debt target as such.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley, your question, please.\nEvan Calio: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nFrank Mount: Hi, Evan.\nEvan Calio: I know there has been an increased focus on project execution, emphasized on the third quarter call from John [Watson] and the Analyst Day, more engineering, less reliance on third parties, and more oversight. Maybe, Joe, because you're on the call today, how do these plans increase your confidence in the ability to improve execution as you deliver this broader slate of projects? And where the biggest areas for continued improvement or execution risk as you bring them online?\nJoseph C. Geagea: Thank you. I'll start by acknowledging that we do some things well. We have delivered good projects. We have Jack/St. Malo. We have the Bibiyana expansion. We have Agbami 3. These are three recent examples where we actually delivered on cost and schedule. Having said that, we and the industry have learned a great deal over the last few years. And the only thing we can do is to actually take those learnings and apply them on future projects. Gorgon Train 2 and Train 3 and Wheatstone Train 1 and Train 2 will benefit from all the learnings on Angola LNG and Gorgon Train 1. All the things, the initiatives we highlighted at the analyst meeting in terms of what it takes to actually improve our chances of execution, we are committed to doing those. We're moving a lot of things in house. We're going to focus on design and engineering. We're going to ensure those designs. We're going to pick the right contractors. We're going to work hard on the right contracting strategy. We need to get projects ready for execution, and we're applying all of those on FGP. And recall the slide we had back in March. FGP is going to be wonderful for us because it is countercyclical. We're going to go into a period where there is capacity in the industry. We're going to go into a period where we will have the right organizational capability working on those projects. And I think it's a tremendous time for us to actually deliver better on those projects. We will have lower execution risk as well on the base shale and tight. We have done look-backs on our short-term investments. And we don't talk about them that much, but they actually beat the expectations always. So as we move into short cycle, we're very confident in delivering those as we take the learnings on the MCPs. Whether it's FGP or other projects we consider doing, I believe our chances of improving execution and delivering those projects should be improved.\nEvan Calio: That's great.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays, your question, please.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Good morning, guys.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Paul.\nFrank Mount: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Joe, I'm just curious. I think a lot of people comment, especially in the U.S. shale. There's high cost deflation maybe coming pretty close to a bottom. So I don't know whether you agree. And also I want to see if you do, does it make sense now to start to lock in the supply cost curve, given that you may be close to a bottom? And how far \u2013 if you guys are willing to do that, how far you may be willing to do it?\nJoseph C. Geagea: Thanks for the question, Paul. I agree with you, I think our opportunity is to work with suppliers and to see if we can have an arrangement that actually give us a better shot at cost, and we're already having those conversations with our suppliers. Now key to this is how much capital we're going to put into those activities. And as Pat said, we have to consider all the lenses before we commit capital. Our intention is to move in that direction. I believe we have the organizational capability to deliver on this, and the conversations we're having with our suppliers tell us that we can do so. And those conversations with respect to locking in rigs and material give us greater confidence that we can sustain some of the savings and the efficiencies that we're seeing right now, so we're exactly working on the kinds of things you're suggesting.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Joe, can you comment in terms of that? To what extent are you willing to do say lock in for your expected 50% of your supply requirement for the next five years or lock in for three years, five years, any kind of the magnitude that you can share?\nJoseph C. Geagea: All I can tell you is that it takes also the supplier to be willing to have those conversations. We clearly have talked about one year, two years, potentially three years in certain areas on rigs, and we're willing to consider that. But like I said, they're going to depend on the program that we have, the pace at which we want to invest, but all of those are on the table. And I think the suppliers are increasingly willing to have that discussion with us. And they're going to see us with the position that I've described earlier in the Permian as a key customer for them. They're going to view those relationships more strategic. They're going to be willing to work with us on everything in the contracts. It's not just the rate that is important. It's that there are a lot of other clauses in the contracts that are importable. So they will see us as a reliable customer with a commitment to the region, and they clearly want to do business with us.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Thank you.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Hey, good morning.\nFrank Mount: Hey, Phil.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Hi, Phil.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Just to follow up on the asset sales commentary, you had talked about $2 billion or so for this year, and so it back-end loads the high end of the $5 billion to $10 billion target. So maybe any additional color you'd have on whether the oil price environment or the asset sale environment in any way pushes you towards the low end or high end of that range? How are you thinking about it now?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: No, I think what we're really just seeing is acknowledgment that some of these transactions take much longer to close for regulatory approval reasons or whatnot than you might think. And so we're just being cautious in terms of the guidance that we're giving, not only in terms of the $5 billion to $10 billion. We feel that is executable; those are transactable. But pinning it down to whether it's going to happen in the next nine months is very hard for us to say at this point. We have a number of transaction activities underway, and getting the precise timing as to whether it closes in 2016 or it closes in 2017 is where the difficult challenge lies. They can be very lumpy. I do agree it's back-end loaded for this year, we believe. But I think it's also likely to be back-end loaded for the 2016 to 2017 time period. Overall, we still have confidence in that $5 billion to $10 billion range that we've indicated for the two years.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Understood. How much is locked in for 2Q, by the way?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I won't give a number completely for 2Q. I'll just say again, for line of sight for this year, we anticipate somewhere around $2 billion, maybe a little bit more. I don't want to get precise on the quarters though.\nPhilip M. Gresh: That's fine, thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I feel good about April because it's almost closed, but I don't want to get any more precise than that.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.\nDouglas Terreson: Good morning, everybody.\nFrank Mount: Good morning, Doug.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Hi, Doug.\nDouglas Terreson: Today's commentary seems to emphasize that cost productivity and asset sales and performance from new projects is going to lead to stronger cash flow for Chevron, and that seems pretty reasonable to me. And on this point, I have two questions. First for clarification, does the divestiture under consideration in Myanmar represent the majority of the position in that country? And the second question is somewhat different. If the industry does recover and free cash flow does materialize, the question is whether there are likely to be changes to Chevron's capital priorities over the medium term. And I ask this question because I think Pat talked a few minutes about greater focus on returns being likely in the future, but I don't think much was said about how share repurchases might play into the mix. So just wanted to see if we could get some color on the capital management priorities and how they might change over the medium term, if they do at all.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I don't really see our priorities changing over the medium term. I mean, we're consistent in how we use the cash and the priorities we have for that. We've laid out the investment program not only for the rest of this year but for 2017-2018, where it's a shift to the shorter-cycle investments. There will be selective major capital projects that get pushed into the portfolio, pushed into the queue. FGP is obviously the headliner on that. I don't see share repurchases coming into play in the medium term here. That is the last use of cash, and I don't see us being in a position where that would be a relevant item for us in the medium term. In terms of Myanmar, it is a full exit.\nDouglas Terreson: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Pat.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nRoger D. Read: Thanks, good morning.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nFrank Mount: Hi, Roger.\nJoseph C. Geagea: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger D. Read: Just to follow up on the $52 laid out for 2017 and the expectation I guess of cash flow neutrality, the CapEx $17 billion to $22 billion, should we think of the asset sales as what impacts the range of CapEx if the price were to average $52 in 2017, or what are some of the other factors there?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: No, I think you're asking about the capital flexibility we have between the $17 billion versus the $22 billion. And -\nRoger D. Read: If oil were $52, what would then determine $17 billion versus $22 billion? I understand the range. I'm trying to understand what would affect which part of the range and whether or not asset sales are part of that assumption.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, so the overall objective is to get balanced in 2017. And obviously, if we're falling short on asset sale proceeds for a reason or other, we would want to take that into account in determining what the capital outlays are because it really is the objective to get balanced. So there would be a tradeoff potentially there if we weren't seeing the execution on asset sales. We don't anticipate that being the case, however. In terms of the prioritization, though, let me just go back to the logic and the process that we have for building up the capital program. We start with the asset integrity and reliability foundation, and then each and every layer of projects above that competes on its merits on a returns-focused basis. And we will balance the short-cycle investments and we will balance initiation and commitment to larger longer-cycle capital projects. Again, the only one of size that's queued up here in the near term would be Future Growth Project. So we will take all of that into account. The overarching objective though is to get balanced on cash in 2017.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Roger.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: And we continue to be very focused on capital discipline, and so there will be high hurdle rates for all of the projects coming forward for possible inclusion in the capital budget.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH.\nAnish Kapadia: Hi. I just had a question looking at some of the pre-FID projects. I was wondering if you could give an idea of where the oil price breakeven has come down to for some of these key projects, such as the Tigris complex, some of your Upper and Lower Tertiary discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico, and also Rosebank in the UK. And then the second question was just looking at returns, I was just wondering. If you look at things internationally, does anything come even close on a risk-adjusted basis to the Permian just when you take into account the high geological, fiscal, political risk? I'm just wondering how you look at that capital allocation. Thank you.\nJoseph C. Geagea: Thank you Anish. I'll take the deepwater question first. Just to it put in context, we're already producing about 140,000 barrels a day in the Gulf of Mexico in the deepwater, and we do that through five operated assets and four non-operated assets. We're also the largest leaseholder in the Gulf. So in the near term, with that footprint, we do see many brownfield deepwater opportunities. In fact, 80% of our development spend over the next few years is going to be geared toward brownfield development, such as Jack/St. Malo and Tahiti, where we actually have good economics. We've already said the single-well breakeven is typically in the $20 to $40 Brent range. We've also demonstrated tremendous improvement in drilling and completion efficiency, so we continue to bring the cost equation down. Now if we're talking about new greenfield development, we've got a few things that need to happen there. Obviously, we need scale in the resource, but we also need to rethink about how we bring our development. We talked before about optimizing our development concept, where we could be trading lower plateau and maybe NPV for greater capital efficiencies. And this is another place where we actually need our suppliers. We need to work closely with them to continue to drive the cost down. This is an important area for us to be good at, and we're committed to do that. Now in terms of how does the Permian compete, we just can't be a Permian company. We have a lot of other places where actually we have good resources. We talked about Tengiz. We talked about Thailand. We talked about Indonesia. Australia is going to give us those opportunities. So yes, while the Permian give us tremendous advantage, the size of our company will require us to actually be broader and to put our capital in places where we can get good economics but not to be solely a one asset class company.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Anish.\nAnish Kapadia: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets, your question, please.\nBrad Heffern: Good morning, everyone. I guess with Gorgon coming very close to the finish line at this point, I was wondering if you can give an update on ultimately where the costs are expected to land for that project, and also if on Wheatstone you're still using the same budget.\nJoseph C. Geagea: I'll start with Wheatstone. We're still operating under the same funding appropriation, which we have communicated to you previously. We do acknowledge we've seen cost pressures. But at the same time, these have been offset by favorable foreign exchange. We're working very hard to mitigate those cost pressures. Earlier this week we had a good review of that project, and we are very encouraged by the progress. I alluded to that in my prepared remarks. So the progress we make over the next eight to 12 months will be very important in terms of where we're going to end up. But for now, there's really no reason to change our view on the cost. And again, Wheatstone is a huge resource base for us, and it is very important to deliver it. Now in terms of Gorgon, we've seen cost pressures on Gorgon. But at the moment, really, we're not going to change the cost estimate that we have provided previously.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James, your question, please.\nLuana Siegfried: Hi, this is Luana Siegfried in for Pavel. Good morning. Thank you for your call. I have two quick questions on U.S. production. So I was wondering if you could share a little bit more details on U.S. production, which grew only by 0.4% year over year, even with Jack/St. Malo and solid production from the Permian.\nFrank Mount: I'm sorry, this is Frank. Could you please repeat that? I was confused by the question.\nLuana Siegfried: Sure, Frank. I was just wondering which plays that are actually in the U.S. are offsetting the growth factors like Jack/St. Malo or the Permian?\nFrank Mount: So can I repeat? I think you're basically saying where are we seeing some base declines in the U.S. that offset the growth we have in the MCPs.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: A piece of that obviously is coming from asset sale divestitures if you're looking at first quarter to first quarter. A significant piece of Gulf of Mexico, multiple asset divestments occurred.\nLuana Siegfried: Perfect. And if I may, I just have another quick one in the U.S. Do you guys have any updates on Bigfoot, the latest startup for the production?\nJoseph C. Geagea: Is the question about Bigfoot?\nLuana Siegfried: Yes.\nJoseph C. Geagea: There is no change from the prior guidance we gave, and that is the second half of 2018.\nFrank Mount: Thank you.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, it looks like that concludes the lineup of questioners. So I want to thank you very much. I want to thank everybody for their time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron, and we appreciate your participation. So, Jonathan, I'll turn it back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}], "2018": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2017, "date": "2018-02-02 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Mike Wirth. Please go ahead.\nMike Wirth: Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Moving to Slide 3. This is a score card outlining performance against our 2017 commitments. We had a good year and accomplished what we set out to do. We met our objectives to get cash balanced. In fact, we were cash balanced without relying on proceeds from asset sales. We stayed below budget on capital spending and continued our downward trend in operating expenses. We\u2019d renew high margin production consistent with our guidance. We realized value from asset sales, with proceeds of more than $8 billion over two years, above the mid-point of the target range and we ended the year within the debt range we predicted. 2017 was a very successful year. We are proud of our progress and we intend to build on this momentum in 2018. Moving to Slide 4, as you can see from the bar chart, 2017 cash flow including asset sales and before dividends grew more than $17 billion from 2016. Some of this growth was a result of rising prices and some was from an increase in asset sale proceeds, but the majority was due to specific actions we took to improve cash generation from our operations. And the result, we were a cash flow positive without asset sales in 2017, a full year earlier than our commitment, with a little help from prices. And we enter 2018 with strong momentum. We know who owns our stock and what they expect. Our number one financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend when we can sustainably support the increase with cash flow and earnings. That\u2019s why earlier this week we announced a dividend increase of $0.04 per share, putting us on track to make 2018 the 31st consecutive year of increased annual per share dividend payout. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat, who will take you through the financial results. Pat?\nPat Yarrington: Alright, thank you Mike. Starting with Slide 5, an overview of our financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings were $3.1 billion or $1.64 per diluted share, while 2017 full-year earnings were $9.2 billion. In the quarter, we had two special items. We recorded a non-cash provisional gain of $2 billion related to U.S. tax reform. We also recognized a non-cash remediation charge of $190 million associated with the former mining assets. Foreign exchange losses for the quarter were $96 million. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange impacts, earnings for the quarter totaled $1.4 billion or $0.72 per share. For the full-year, earnings on the same basis totaled $7 billion. Full-year cash flow from operations was $20.5 billion. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $6.2 billion, reflecting strong upstream production and higher realizations. Downstream results were noticeably lower than in the third quarter and I\u2019ll say more on that in just a moment. Excluding the $2 billion differed tax provision I just mentioned, the three items we have called out all year as headwinds to cash flow meaning changes in working capital, affiliate dividends less then earnings, and deferred taxes aggregated to around $3 billion for the year. For the quarter, these components represented a tailwind of approximately $350 million, in large part because of working capital effects. In the quarter, we had a noticeable increase in international income taxes payable. For the full-year, working capital was a minor benefit. Return on capital employed for 2017 was 5%. Our debt ratio at year-end was 21% and our net debt ratio was approximately 18%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. You\u2019re already aware that we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.12 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of February 16. We currently yield 3.6%. Now on Slide 6. Slide 6 compares full-year 2017 earnings with 2016. Full-year 2017 earnings were approximately $9.7 billion higher than 2016 results. Special items, primarily U.S. tax reform gain of $2 billion lower impairments and other charges of $1.9 billion, and increased gains from asset sales of $1 billion benefited our earnings by $4.9 billion. A swing in foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings between periods by $504 million. The passage of tax reform legislation in late December required that we revalue our net deferred tax liability to reflect the new lower 21% tax rate. Earnings impact from this adjustment are evident in all three of our were reporting segments, and again, I will refer you to the appendix for the detailed segmented information. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by about 5.1 billion between periods. Higher realizations, increased volumes, and lower costs were partially offset by higher DD&A, which was mostly associated with increased production. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by just under 400 million. Higher margins were partially offset by lower volumes and lower earnings from CPChem, mainly due to the impacts of Hurricane Harvey. Full-year 2017 other segment results were in line with our guidance. Our 2018 guidance for the other segment is $2.4 billion in net charges. This includes approximately $600 million of interest expense that was previously capitalized and $300 million worth of incremental tax effects as net charges are deducted at the lower rate post U.S. tax reform. As a reminder, our quarterly results in this segment are non-ratable. Turning to Slide 7. We are aware of the challenges of modelling and integrated company like Chevron, and in particular modelling downstream results in the quarter were oil prices grows as fast as they did. I therefore like to provide some additional commentary. Our downstream margins were squeezed by rising feedstock costs. We estimate this adverse margin effect between third quarter and fourth quarter to be about 500 million across our operations, but specifically on the West Coast where we have two or our three main U.S. refineries. Industry refinery utilization in PADD 5 was very strong during the second half of the quarter, leading to abundant supplies and putting even greater pressure on margins. We also experienced adverse impacts from two hurricanes. We estimate a further $119 million penalty from these, relative to the third quarter. I\u2019m referencing both Hurricane Nate at the Pascagoula, where a precautionary shutdown was taken; and Hurricane Harvey, which flooded CPChem\u2019s Cedar Bayou plant. While the hurricanes were known to have hit our facilities, sizing the financial impact would have been difficult. I\u2019d note that these fourth quarter impacts are not structural, they are transitory and we believe the fundamentals around demand, supply, production, prices and margins for refined products and chemicals are positive for 2018. The other segment for the quarter was a sizeable negative, but the full-year charges were aligned with the guidance I gave third quarter call. And lastly, but very importantly, we had very solid results in upstream in the quarter. Our strong operating performance was complemented by rising prices and both favorable elements are expected to continue in 2018. As you know, our earnings and cash flows are highly leveraged to crude prices and this leverage is expected to grow as our production grows in 2018. Turning now to Slide 8. Slide 8 illustrates 2017 production is of 2.73 million barrels a day, an increase of 134,000 barrels a day or 5%, up from 2016. Major capital projects increased production by 240,000 barrels a day, as we started and ramped up multiple projects, including Gorgon and Angola LNG. Lower plant turnaround effects, primarily at Tengiz, favorably impacted production between periods by 34,000 barrels a day. Shale and tight production increased 46,000 barrels a day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian. Base declines, net of production from new wells such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria were 45,000 barrels a day. PSC effects reduced production by 68,000 barrels a day, as rising prices and lower spend reduced cost recovery barrels. The impact of asset sales, mainly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and mid-continent reduced production by 66,000 barrels a day. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mike.\nMike Wirth: Alright, thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 9, reserve replacement is a real success story. As this chart shows, over the last five years we\u2019ve added about 400 million more barrels than we produced and divested. Our reserve replacement ratio was 155% in 2017, and 107% over the last five years. We\u2019re especially pleased with this outcome because it was achieved on top of growing production last year. Our reserves to production ratio stands at a healthy 11.7 demonstrating the strength and sustainability of our business. In 2017, the Permian was the largest contributor to reserve additions, where we continue to lower our cost structure, focus our investment, and develop our resources in a capital efficient manner. As we continue to ramp up our rig fleet, we\u2019re confident this pattern should continue. We also saw significant adds elsewhere across the portfolio, including from the Gorgon Project where well performance has been encouraging. Moving to Slide 10. This chart shows the continued progress we\u2019ve made on spend reduction. As you can see, capital on operating expenses were down again this year. 2017 C&E spending was $18.8 billion, down $3.6 million from the prior year, and more than $21 billion from three years earlier. 2017 full year operating costs were more than $1 billion lower than 2016, despite higher upstream production. When compared to 2014, we\u2019re down by nearly $6 billion. I expect this to maintain capital and cost discipline. We\u2019re improving work processes, negotiating better rates from contractors and vendors, and becoming more efficient in all that we do. And technology offers opportunities for even more. We are in a cyclical commodity business. Capital discipline always matters. Costs, always matter. Now to Slide 11, and asset sales. This chart shows asset sale proceeds of $8 billion over the last two years, with 5.2 billion coming in 2017. The two-year total is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $5 billion to $10 billion. Moving forward, we will continue to optimize our portfolio where appropriate, using proceeds to support strong asset and shareholder returns. The criteria for divestments is straightforward. We will plan to sell assets that don't have a strategic fit or won\u2019t compete for capital and work more to someone else, and when we can receive good value. We don't discuss specific assets until we\u2019re into a transaction. We have one of these underway. The sale of our Southern Africa refining and marketing business, which is expected to close in 2018. Moving to Slide 12, our Australian LNG assets are becoming strong cash generators with cash margins of more than $30 per barrel at $50 Brent price. Currently, four trains are online and running well. Well performance for both projects looks good. During the fourth quarter, we completed pit stops on Gorgon Train 1 and Train 3 to improve reliability and increase production. Gorgon's average January production was 459,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 86,000 barrels from the fourth quarter average on a 100% basis. During 2017, Gorgon shipped 170 cargoes. At Wheatstone, during the fourth quarter, we started Train 1, reached design capacity, and successfully address the commissioning strainers, which is a standard part of commissioning this type of LNG plant design. Wheatstone Train 1 average January production was 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a 100% basis. First LNG for Wheatstone Train 2 is slated for second-quarter 2018. We start-up for Wheatstone domestic gas the following quarter. Now, let\u2019s go to the Permian on Slide 13. Production in the Permian continues to exceed expectations as we drive further efficiency gains and improved well performance. In the fourth quarter, we produced approximately 205,000 barrels per day, up approximately 60,000 barrels per day from the same period in 2016. Full-year 2017 production averaged 181,000 barrels per day, up 35% over the prior year. We\u2019re currently operating 16 rigs in the basin and plan to end this year with 20 company operated rigs. And in support of our development program, we\u2019re currently employing six pressure pumping crews. I\u2019ll update you on progress to optimize our land position in the Permian on Slide 14. In 2017, we enhanced the value of our position by transacting more than 60,000 acres through various swaps, joint ventures farmouts and sales. These transactions improve capital efficiency and create value by consolidating land positions, allowing longer laterals and other infrastructure efficiencies. Last year's transactions enabled nearly 600 additional long laterals to be added to our well inventory. We intend to continue this activity to consolidate our land positions and optimize the value of our future developments. We\u2019ll provide further information on the Permian at our Analyst Day in early March. Now, let\u2019s move to the overall production outlook on Slide 15. For this year, production at $16 Brent is expected to be 4% to 7% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2018 asset sales. Growth is expected to be driven by LNG in Australia, Shale and tight particularly in the U.S. and Canada, and other capital projects. Partially offsetting that will be full year impacts of 2017 asset sales and base decline. The forecasted production range reflects the uncertainties associated with start-up timing, rates of production project ramp up, base decline and external events. In summary, we anticipate another year of strong production growth. Moving to Slide 16, we\u2019ve had a number of recent developments that I\u2019d like to acknowledge. Earlier this week, we announced a major discovery in the U.S. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico at Ballymore. This discovery has 670 feet of net oil pay with excellent reservoir year and fluid characteristics. And importantly, it\u2019s close to our existing Blind Faith platform. We\u2019re currently drilling a sidetrack well to further evaluate the extent of the resource. Also, this week, we confirmed a major discovery at the Whale prospect in the US Gulf of Mexico where we\u2019re 40% partner. This find is approximately 10 miles from the Perdido platform. These discoveries are exciting for both their resource potential and their proximity to existing infrastructure, which offers the possibility for faster and more capital efficient development. Also, this week, we along with our partners were successful bidders on a large Deepwater block in Mexico, adding to our position there. An installation is underway at Bigfoot. We\u2019re installed seven of the 16 mooring tendons. On Tuesday, the tension-leg platform sale from the dry dock facility in Ingleside, Texas. First production is forecast for late this year. In downstream, CPChem reached mechanical completion of the Gulf Coast cracker in December and has begun the process of commissioning. We expect to start up later this quarter and reach full production in the second quarter of 2018. You'll recall that the derivative units achieved first production in September of last year. Finally, on tax reform, we believe the new legislation is good for business, and for consumers. It is a positive for Chevron making attractive investment opportunities in the Permian, the Gulf of Mexico, and in our US downstream and chemicals business look even better. Our US capital and exploratory spend is expected to be up approximately $8 billion this year, and some $25 billion over the next three years. Moving to Slide 17, I would like to share a few closing thoughts. Over the last decade plus, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to get to know many of you. I\u2019ve been listening and your input has been helpful as I move into my new role. I\u2019m guided by my background, experience and a few core beliefs. I grew up playing sports and I like to win. I intend to lead Chevron to win in any environment. To win, you need to have clear convictions. Here are some of mine. We must be disciplined in returns driven in capital allocation. Our cost structure needs to improve further. Costs, always matter. We can get more out of the assets that we have as we can operate them better and more reliably. We can optimize across the entire value chain to capture more value. And we need to continue to high-grade our portfolio and our resource base. To build the assets to win today and tomorrow, not yesterday. For those of you I know, I look forward to seeing you more in the coming months and years. For those of you I don't, I look forward to meeting you. I\u2019m committed to continuing to grow cash flow, improve, returns, and deliver value to our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions. Jonathan, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please?\nPhil Gresh: Hi, good morning and congratulations Mike.\nMike Wirth: Thank you.\nPhil Gresh: I\u2019ll start with, I have one for Pat and one for Mike. So, Pat, you talked about these moving pieces around CFO items, these transitory factors that have been going on throughout 2017, and I was just curious how you think about 2018 with those factors, the deferred tax, working capital, equity affiliates, you know does that continue to be a headwind, does it dissipate in anyway?\nPat Yarrington: So, I think the short answer would be, to a large extent there will be some continuing factors. The largest single component there would be the difference that we would expect between affiliate earnings and affiliate dividends. That will continue to be a component there. The harder one to predict, clearly will be what\u2019s happening on that deferred tax side of things that will be very price dependent, and then of course working capital is always very hard as well. But if I assume that there is no change in working capital, just assume prices at the beginning of the year or the same is at the end of the year, and our activity levels are relatively flattish. So, no impact from working capital and I put the other two components together. So, the affiliate distributions versus earnings component, as well as an estimate around deferred taxes, I would say somewhere on the order of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion worth of headwinds would be the best estimate, but I have to say, I reserve the right at any time to come back and tell you as different number of prices are significantly different than where they are, today.\nPhil Gresh: I understand, but I appreciate that. Mike, just on your final remarks that you made, appreciate those and I guess my follow-up to that would be, we saw a nice hike in the dividend, $0.04 and as we think about the cash flow profile for the company heading into 2018 at current price levels, it seems like you have a lot of excess cash, so any initial thoughts you could share with us about how you think about deploying that cash, is there room for buybacks, is prices holding where they are?\nMike Wirth: Well Phil, the first thing I would say is, our priorities have been consistent for quite some time, and I have no expectations that those will change. So, dividends come first and you\u2019ve seen that and I\u2019m pleased that the board saw, has a confident view of our future and was willing to authorize the increase you just saw. Reinvestment in the business, we\u2019ve talked about that, and we\u2019ve got our budget outlined and a good program underway this year. Third is, balance sheet and we\u2019ve gone from having relatively for us higher levels of debt down to a range lower within the range that we\u2019d indicated further and then of course, historically one we\u2019ve had cash surplus to those needs, we have bought back shares. So, I think we\u2019ll continue to be consistent in those priorities. It\u2019s always a balance across all of those and we really been in a period where we\u2019ve seen three years of declining or unexciting commodity prices, and three months of encouraging ones. I think it\u2019s a little premature to get ahead of sales on this, but the dividend increase was certainly a signal that we feel good about where our business is positioned to the fact that we\u2019re cash balance, and if we continue to be in a constructive environment, obviously we\u2019ll have cash to balance across all of those priorities. So, more to follow.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. Thanks Mike.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. I think it\u2019s still morning, good morning everybody and Mike congrats on officially taking the reins and getting on the call this morning. I have two questions. I guess one is, kind of a follow-up to Phil\u2019s and it really relates to the strong performance in the Permian. You\u2019ve kind of positioned the Permian, in the past there is something of an offset to base decline, but obviously it\u2019s a pretty strong growth in asset in its own right. Is that how we should think about the Permian as basically a means of resetting your sustaining capital or should we think about something that can actually become a bit more of a topline growth engine for the company?\nMike Wirth: Well, I think if you look at it on its own, it clearly is a growth engine. The nature of the activity is more aligned with what you would traditionally think of our base business, right. It is ongoing drilling of wells that individually carry with on a low risk profile that are relatively quick to execute and it\u2019s the kind of thing that over time you can Flex that up or you can flex it down. So, one of the reasons I think it\u2019s been useful for people to think about putting base and Shale and tight together is their operational characteristics, their flexibility, the cycle time, the risk profile. I have more in common than our base business does with the really large major capital projects that we\u2019ve had. So, I do think you can think of them together. We\u2019ve done a really nice job of mitigating our base decline on its own, and then when you add the Shale and tight with it, the growth there is actually and you can see it on Slide 8, greater than the base decline is. And so, we\u2019ve got low risk, a very predictable flexible and controllable growth offsetting that base decline, and giving us a strong foundation as we move forward that just has a very, very different risk profile than a long cycle major capital project where there is a big bang at the end, but there is a greater latency period. So, we will certainly talk more about this in March, but I think it\u2019s one of the fundamental shifts in the outlook for our company. I think it\u2019s a fundamental shift in risk profile, and the variability around our cash flows, and frankly it really underpins a really good story as we move forward.\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate the full-answer. My follow-up is really harking back to the breakfast you hosted in December, and it really relates to, I think a comment you made about the culture of cost reduction from other parts of the business hadn't really, and not to put words in your mouth, but hadn't translated into E&P. So, during a period of growth, obviously so I\u2019m just curious, are you happy with the cost structure in the E&P business, and the maturity profile of the underlying portfolio, and I guess it is another way of saying, should we expect another rest in the asset sales program as we go forward? And I will leave it there. Thanks.\nMike Wirth: All right. Well there is a couple of things. I think cost culture and the portfolio. The entire industry as commodity prices went into the surge and then stayed strong for a long period of time had incentives to try to capitalize on that, and there is no doubt that the cost structure within the industry grew as a result of that. Most of my working life has been spent in our part of business where those periods of times are in frequent and short in duration, and so I come from a mindset that you always have to be looking at cost and in particular, you need to be very cost conscious at a time when external conditions are incenting you to be less so. And so, I think that being focused on efficiency throughout the cycle is one of the keys to success. I tried to make that point in my closing remarks there. Our upstream business has done a fantastic job in getting our cost down, and I\u2019m really pleased with what I\u2019ve seen, and what\u2019s been accomplished, and so there has been great progress I mentioned $6 billion in spend reduction over the last few years. I think going forward, the challenge is, how do we sustain that momentum, and there is an opportunity to continuously focus on this to challenge everything that we do for more efficiency to look for technology, which I think can unlock a lot of cost reduction. And then to leverage some of the things we\u2019re learning in our Permian activity, and our shale and tight activity and ask, how does the supplier cross other parts of the business. So, it\u2019s a long answer to saying, yes, I expect us to continue to work on costs, irrespective of the external environment. When I moved to portfolio, I made a comment about focusing on those assets that are the ones that allow us to compete and win today and tomorrow, and I do expect as to invest in those things that we think are the assets that will be a highly competitive as we move into the future, and to test ourselves on the things that may have been really important in our past and may still be or may not be as we go forward. So, the last couple of years are as said, transaction activity has been in part at least driven by the intent to get cash balance. As we move forward, it\u2019s driven more by the intent to ensure we\u2019ve got a portfolio that\u2019s highly competitive that deliver strong returns and is set up to compete in the future.\nFrank Mount: Thanks Doug.\nDoug Leggate: I guess we'll wait on the Analyst Day [ph]. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta, Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nNeil Mehta: Hi, thanks and congrats Mike. I actually wanted to follow-up where you left of there on the asset sales program, any early thoughts on 2018? You\u2019ve been through a two-year pretty substantial divestiture program, a fewer things on the docket it seems like in 2018, so how should we think about what the new normal is for our divestitures?\nMike Wirth: Yes, Neil, I think you should expect us to continue to monetize assets where we can get fair value and they\u2019re worth more to someone else than they are to us. And we have gone through a lot. You\u2019ve seen those close. The Gulf of Mexico Shelf exit was one where those assets have some running life ahead of them. Within our portfolio, they\u2019ll struggle to compete for capital in somebody else's portfolio, they\u2019ll draw capital in investments and continue to create value for that company. And so, we probably have other assets that would, could fit that profile. So, I think when we get to our Analyst Day in March, we\u2019ll probably speak to this a little bit more, but my view is, you can't fall in love with your portfolio, you have to constantly challenge whether or not it will compete in the future, and you have to be willing to make moves to invest in the things that you believe are highly competitive, and be willing to face the realities and things that you are less likely to fund and that you may be able to redeploy that cash into assets that strengthen your competitive position. So, more of an optimization philosophy. It is what we have done in other parts of the business and it served us very well, and we will talk to you more about that as we have things that are ready to be discussed, publicly.\nNeil Mehta: I appreciate that Mike and then, in the slides the 4 to 7% production growth in 2018, I think is generally well received, is still relatively wide range relative to the base of production that you have, can you talk about some of those uncertainties that could drive you to the upper end or the lower end of the range?\nMike Wirth: Yes. So, I realize there is a bit of a range there. What we\u2019ve done is try to reflect the realities that project start-ups are things that we have got plans, and then you work hard to deliver those, but there can be some variability in start-ups and then you\u2019ve got to ramp ups as well. And so, and I guess the final thing that I would say is, you do have unexpected events that can get you. We\u2019ve experienced sabotage, you know the partition zone is still down and that was not something that was necessarily anticipated. We work in parts of the world that have challenging environments and things happen. So, there is a range there, clearly, we\u2019re working to deliver strong growth and we\u2019d expect to be within that range. Over the years, we have ended up on Mr. Sankey's Porcupine Chart, I think, when we've gotten out of our skis a little bit. So, I try to be sure that we can give you a range that we\u2019re confident, and in this year, we gave you a range that was little wider may be than you would have liked, but we landed squarely in the middle of that. And so, we're just trying to reflect the realities that these things are, you know they\u2019re not precisely forecastable, but we\u2019re trying to show you that we\u2019ve got a strong commitment to deliver good production growth again this year.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Neil.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nPaul Sankey: Well thanks for that Mike. And I guess I know what I'm going to be publishing on Sunday as a chart, but firstly congratulations and I would like to second previous comments that we do greatly appreciate that you guys take the time to come on the quarterly call every quarter. So, thanks for that.\nMike Wirth: You're welcome.\nPaul Sankey: Mike, having said all that, there is a theme of the day which is cash flows that you guys are generating and you did mention cash flow breakeven balance, and when we look at oil at 60 for the quarter-ish, I guess we're totally perplexed by why cash flows, and you\u2019ve given an ex-working capital number, why cash flows are so low given the move in oil? Could you talk about where that\u2019s going to go next year, and whether, if oil prices were to persist, what we would expect to see for cash flows versus CapEx from the company? Thank you.\nMike Wirth: Yes, so Pat has given you given you some of the pieces, and if she wants to try to go a little deeper, I\u2019ll invite her too in a second. I have got to tell you Paul, I\u2019m very pleased and optimistic with the outlook for cash flow. You know, our cash flow from operations improved every quarter during 2017. I sighted a few of the things that are already evident this year, which is significantly stronger production in January at Gorgon, significantly stronger production already this year at Wheatstone. Significantly stronger production in the Permian, in a price environment that you\u2019ve just described. The downstream issues that we faced in the fourth quarter are not structural. They are not repeating, hurricanes happen, but they tend not to hit the same places every year, and margins in the business can ebb and flow. We don't have structural issues in the downstream at all. Our downstream has been a strong contributor of our earnings returns and cash flow for many, many years. So, I used the word momentum a couple of times in my remarks, and we in fact do have momentum in cash flow. So, we have got growing production. The production we're bringing in line is cash flow accretive. You know, I mentioned that our LNG out of Australia is $30 cash margin at a $50 Brent price. Obviously, we\u2019re above that today. So, all the fundamental drivers of cash flow are moving in the right direction. There is a few are headwinds, which Pat touched on, but the fundamentals here are very strong and those are what I am focused on. So, I feel good about 2018.\nPaul Sankey: Yes, Mike, just quickly to follow up, could you just reiterate the 2018 balance aspirations, I think they were excess of sales for cash flow versus CapEx?\nMike Wirth: Yes, we said, we would be cash balance in 2018 without asset sales at $50 Brent. Clearly, if we have a year that is above $50 Brent, we will be better than cash balance without asset sales. And you also mentioned capital in there Paul, so let me just touch on that. You know, we\u2019ve got a capital budget and that capital budget is driven by a program that will deliver the results I just spoke to. We don\u2019t budget based on the oil price of the day. We have got a longer-term view on commodity prices and we set our plans based on those views not the then current oil price. So, the fact that we\u2019re enjoying a little bit better commodity price environment as we sit here today is not something that is going to change our capital plans or our capital budget.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.\nJason Gammel: Hi, everyone and Mike let me add my congratulations as well.\nMike Wirth: Thanks Jason.\nJason Gammel: I just want to go to the chart on, excuse me the graph on chart 13 that depicts the Permian production, and the actual production is clearly way ahead of the type curves that you got laid out, and that\u2019s for 16 rigs, and conscious you're going to be going to 20. So, other than Bruce Niemeyer getting a well-deserved promotion, I was hoping that you might be able to come up with some of the factors that have led to this outperformance, and realize that you are not going to necessarily change the curves and tell at least March?\nMike Wirth: Well, what I would say is, it has just been a focus on the fundamentals. We\u2019ve used technology to do better assessment of seismic attributes and better understand the resource. Our petrophysical modeling continues to improve. We are using new technologies to control drill bits and improve the precision of our lateral placement. There is a new basis of design where we change well spacing, optimize our sand concentration per stage, we have increased the number of stages. We have got tighter perforation. There is a continual optimization process in place and I would just tell you same thing that Bruce and others have reiterated is, we not only learn from what we are doing, but we are brining the learnings from joint venture partners and others that we see and rapidly applying those to improve performance. So, our costs are going down. Our productivity is going up. Our recoveries continue to grow and I don't think we\u2019ve seen the end of the improvement curve here. We\u2019re finding more efficiencies, our development costs this year are lower than our target was. Our target for, or last year they were, our target for 2018 is lower than it was in 2017, and so we expect to see continual improvement. For those of you that visited the Permian last year, I think you heard our people describe what they call the Frankenwell, the perfect well where we continue to redefine what that looks like, and redefine what goods looks like. So, this is a story that when you match it up with our large land position, which we\u2019re optimizing. I talked about that and building a deeper inventory of long lateral and highly efficient acreage for us to get after the ability through the midstream and downstream to add value and create more margin. And on top of that you put a royalty position. This is an asset that I expect to continue to get better. We will talk about that more when we see in March and we will update some of the guidance that we\u2019ve given you on what to expect.\nJason Gammel: We'll look forward to that and as my second question Mike, just looking at the capital allocation for 2018 to the base upstream business relative to 2017, and this excludes the shale and tight allocations. Base business allocation is down by about 25% year-over-year. It doesn't look like your assumptions on the base decline curve have really changed, however. So, could you talk about some of the factors that you\u2019re seeing in the base business that is leading to the lower capital allocation with a similar expected result?\nMike Wirth: Yes, you\u2019re right. We do have lower capital going into the base business this year. Some of that is simply driven by what the opportunity set looks like there, and what the opportunity set looks like in the Permian. We\u2019ve, like I said, we\u2019ve done a really nice job across a lot of our producing assets in holding base decline at pretty flattish levels. And so, the efficiencies that I have talked about in the Permian are the kinds of things that we\u2019re seeing across the entire base business. We\u2019ve taken cost out of the supply chain. We\u2019ve improved the efficiency and productivity of operations and at times some of the things in the base can be deepwater infield drilling, which tends to be a little bit bigger dollar. And so, as those programs ebb and flow that can cycle that base business a little bit as well, but we\u2019re in a range here as you look it, it says we can keep our base pretty flat at relatively manageable capital spend. You put the Permian on top of that and you look at just a combination of those two elements and you say okay, we have a base load of capital that can hold our production flat or even slightly growing base load of capital that can keep production flatter. So, I think it is a relatively modest capital relative to the size of our company, and so we\u2019ll talk more about the sustainability and what you can expect on that when we see in March.\nFrank Mount: Thank you, Jason.\nJason Gammel: Great, looking forward it. Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.\nPaul Cheng: Hi guys, good morning.\nMike Wirth: Hi, Paul.\nPat Yarrington: Hi, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Hi. Mike, may I add my congratulations to you. And also, I just want to echo what Sankey has said, really appreciate. You guys come on to the call from time to time. I hope that at least one of your other major competitors will do the same. Two questions. First, Mike, in the coming months, I will assume you are going to go and visit all your internal people around the group. During those visits, what is the number one and number two message that you want to send to them in terms of where you think you may need to do more effort in twisting [ph], whether it's in certain practice or culture? And where you want to sharpen the focus.\nMike Wirth: Well, thanks Paul for the kind words and the question. I do intend to get out and about and see people and deliver some messages. I mean the first one is, it has been a rough few years for people in, particularly in our upstream business and we have weathered that storm and so the message is, simply thank you for what you have done to put us in a position now, where we\u2019re cash positive going forward. With that asset sales we\u2019ve taken a lot of cost out of the business and they\u2019ve worked hard to do that. I\u2019ve touched on a couple of things already. One is, we have to be prepared to win in any environment. And I think that\u2019s particularly important as you start to see a little recovery in oil price that we not think that the hard work is over. We\u2019ve got to focus on returns. We still have returns that need to improve. And we can't count on market to do that. So, we\u2019ve got to keep focusing on self-help and that means we find efficiencies and everything we do. We challenge our portfolio, and some of the things I\u2019ve talked about. So, there is a - we\u2019ve got to win in any environment. We\u2019ve got to improve returns. I think, some of the areas that are focused on the things that really matter, and big companies can some time try to do everything, and there is few things we can focus on that will really drive performance. We need to execute, and that means capital projects. We need to execute on cost management. We need to execute on our safety and reliability initiatives. And then, the third one is, how do we bring more technology into our business? You look around and technology is changing the world. We\u2019ve got lots and lots of digital technology applications that are springing up all over our business. I\u2019d like to see that happen faster. I think there is more that we can do with technology. I think it can drive further efficiencies in our cost structure. I think it can drive further productivity in our assets. I think it can help us mitigate operating risks. And, so I talked to them about how do we continue to find ways to leverage technology to further improve performance. So those will be some of the key messages that they\u2019ll be hearing from me.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. The second question is that, on the U.S. onshore market clearly on the [indiscernible] basis, we are seeing cost inflation. Just want to see whether you believe your productivity gain will be more than - or that could be fully offset and so your unit costs will be essentially flat? And in the outside U.S., I think the service cost, doesn't seem like on the spot rate is dropping. But should we assume that your overall unit cost may still be dropping because you have other contracts maybe rolling over?\nMike Wirth: Yes. Paul, you are touching on important points. That\u2019s one of the questions a lot of people are asking, as are we going to see cost inflation. I will tell you right now as we go around the world and we engage in sourcing exercises, we are not seeing evidence of strong cost inflation really anywhere. Now, you mentioned the Permian. I\u2019ll come back and talk the Permian in a minute, but we really are continuing to find opportunities to hold or even improve costs as we look around the world. In the Permian, there is more activity picking up, and so you can expect that there is talk of that, you know two-thirds of our spend in the Permian is protected with contracts right now. Those contracts have been negotiated before we went into this year. We\u2019ve got kind of a philosophy of managed competition there to lock in and with our size and leverage we\u2019re in an attractive base load for a number of these suppliers. So, we\u2019ve locked in a good pricing fixed index, fixed pricing in much of the portfolio. Some indexed pricing. So, if there are certain indices that moved, we will accommodate that and then there are incentive contracts where you have some of our service providers can meet performance benchmarks that drive our costs lower there is some sharing of that as well. So, we\u2019re focused on ways to continue to improve our cost position there and the efficiencies in activity and productivity that we\u2019ve seen in recent times have amplified reductions in input costs. If you start to see input costs level out or even turn a little bit, I still expect further improvements in productivity and efficiency will offset that. So, we could see some very modest, but I\u2019m talking single-digit, overall increase within the Permian, but a step back to our whole portfolio we\u2019ve got growing production, and we are not going to allow cost to grow at the rate that production is growing, and so from my unit cost standpoint, you can absolutely expect that we're still focused on driving unit costs even lower.\nFrank Mount: Thanks Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please.\nAlastair Syme: Thank you and hello, everyone. Mike, one of your peers has recently suggested that SEC reserves are becoming a less meaningful metric for the industry. And obviously, this is a metric that Chevron has scored very highly on in recent years. So, can I get you to offer your perspective on how you look - as you look closer into the E&P business, how you view reserve life as a management KPI? And whether you think there is an optimal reserve life for the business to be running?\nMike Wirth: Yes. So, we respect the SEC's roles and their reserve process. We are very diligent in setting up our own internal approach to reserves to be sure that we have the right checks and balances, and so we - I\u2019m not going to suggest the SEC regressive rules or anything with something that we understand, comply with and they are, I think a consistent benchmark for investors to use to evaluate companies. And so, like many things, you can argue are they perfect or not, but it is a consistent benchmark and we all use it. So, I think it\u2019s useful. I believe stability and reserve life is good. If you see reserve life growing it\u2019s either a sign that your production is declining, or that you are investing prematurely or too much. If you see the reserve where reserve life is declining, it starts to raise questions about sustainability about the need to go out, and spend money to acquire resource and so to me stability is the key. We\u2019ve had a good stable R-over-P ratio here for the last many years and continue to add our reserves, primarily through organic activity. I talked about the reserve ads this year being driven by the Permian and Gorgon. Those are big contributors, and those are certainly contributors that we can see out into the future. We would expect to play a part in extending reserves life as we go forward. So, I think each company has got their own particular set of circumstances, and I\u2019ll only comment on ours. I think we\u2019re in a good strong and sustainable reserves position.\nAlastair Syme: Brilliant. Thank you. That's very, very helpful.\nFrank Mount: Thanks Al.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question, please.\nBlake Fernandez: First, good morning, and my congratulations as well. Back, I guess, right on that reserves topic. Maybe Pat, this is a question for you, but given the nice increase that you saw this year, is it fair to think that DD&A rates have potential to move lower as a result of that?\nPat Yarrington: Yes. I do believe that. I don\u2019t have an order of magnitude for you at the moment because we are just finalizing that. You\u2019ll note that the numbers we\u2019ve put out are preliminary and we\u2019re tying that now between now and when we publish the 10-K later in February. But yes, I do directionally that will happen. We will have lower DD&A rates.\nBlake Fernandez: Perfect. The second question is on the, I guess recent discoveries you\u2019ve had, both look pretty attractive and then look like they have fast track potential. Given this focus on short cycle, the past 12 to 18 months or so, obviously, you haven't sanctioned many projects, but these look promising. I guess I'm just trying to understand the timing of when you could look at sanctioning that and how that would fall into the capital program. And I guess what I'm thinking there specifically is phasing with Tengiz. As Tengiz rolls off, could these kind of make their way in and hopefully not create a step-change in total spending?\nMike Wirth: Yes. We\u2019re really still appraising these discoveries, and they\u2019re encouraging and we\u2019re very pleased with the first look and the proximity to infrastructure, but I think it\u2019s really premature to jump into exactly when and how those would be developed, other than the proximity the infrastructure does open up more capital efficient developments alternatives and you would see if you were distant from, but more work to be done to be sure that these have been fully characterized. I think to get above that a little bit, I would just say that we really believed in a more ratable C&E program is important. I think it helps us financially. I think it helps us from our standpoint of execution. And so, I think that the swings you\u2019ve seen in our C&E spend are things that we will try to significantly dampen out and stay in a more ratable band. The last thing I would say is, no matter how good this resource looks, and how interesting it is, we\u2019ve got a great option in our shale and tight portfolio and other resource classes and Gulf of Mexico deepwater is a great example of that. Need to get the cost down in order to compete for funding. Our people know that that\u2019s what they need to do to make these competitive within our portfolio for funding, and that\u2019s why I think the brownfield aspect of these is interesting, but they have to compete and they have to deliver attractive returns and economics relative to our other alternatives.\nFrank Mount: Thanks Blake.\nBlake Fernandez: Very helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nRyan Todd: Great, thanks. Maybe another one on capital allocation. Post the tax reform, does the tax reform in the U.S. impact the way that you think about investment at all over the next five years, either from - in terms of an increase in cash flow or from an improved rate of return from associated or particular projects? Or should we think that you will generally continue to err on the side of capital constraint? I guess how - does it figure at all in terms of how you look at allocating capital over the next five years?\nMike Wirth: Yes, we\u2019re still grinding through the real details of our specific position and these are - companies like ours have complex tax positions and so to get too specific about that, it\u2019s probably premature. I would say that it makes U.S. assets and investments more attractive because they are going to be attracting a lower tax rate. And so, I think over time, as I said earlier, I think it\u2019s good for the U.S. economy. I think it\u2019s good for U.S. companies. I think it\u2019s good for investment in this country, and we have significant assets here already and opportunities to invest in the future. So, we will grind through all of that and make sure that we get a clear understanding and guidance. The other thing if you think about it through the lens is, you know as we have assets around the world, some in fiscal regimes that have not changed for quite some time whether it\u2019s in response to lower prices or the changes in the US tax laws, those investments become tougher to make, frankly. And so, I think, the other thing is governments around the world will over time have to evaluate the competitiveness of their fiscal terms relative to the options that a company like ours would have. We allocate our capital to drive better returns across the global portfolio, and so as these things move around it\u2019s a competitive world and we need to acknowledge that as do others.\nFrank Mount: Thanks Ryan.\nRyan Todd: And then maybe a follow-up on the Permian. You've been relatively active and you have a slide in there on acreage sales that you've done over the past few years and expectations for 2018. If you think about the program, I mean, would you characterize it as more of an effort to core up your position? Or is it an effort to pull forward to some extent kind of the long-term tail of the valuation, a mix of both? And I guess kind of given your expectation of going to 20 rigs at year-end, you clearly have a very, very, very long resource life there. How should we think about your philosophy in terms of maximizing the value of the asset? Could you monetize more in terms of monetizing some of the tail or accelerating rig count? I mean, how do you look at maximization of the value of that resource?\nMike Wirth: It\u2019s a good question. The real goal is to maximize the value of the resource position and the largest driver by a significant amount is coring up acreage, so that we can get longer laterals in the efficiencies that we continue to see out of our operations. I mentioned, we understand the resource much better today than we did 12-months ago, and our 24-months ago, and I think we will understand the resource better 12-months from now, as we continue to use more and more sophisticated tools and gain more experience and insights into what makes it work. So, as you have that kind of knowledge and you\u2019ve got a large land position we would intend to drive our portfolio to what we believe are the sweetest of the sweet spots and the positions that will create the most value over time. If that means some of it is, what you would describe as further back in the queue, and the right thing to do is simply to exit it for cash and redeploying into coring up today, that is certainly a part of it. But it\u2019s a value driven strategy and it\u2019s to say, okay we\u2019ve, how do we get the most value out of the 2 million acres that we have there. So, it is not driven by any intent to sell the tail alone, but it is really to create value across the whole position.\nFrank Mount: Thank you, Ryan.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question\u2026\nPat Yarrington: One more question, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nRoger Read: Thanks for sneaking me in here at the end. Good morning, everybody. Mike, if I could follow up a little bit on Ryan's question, you kind of talked about the Permian position there, is it easier, the same, or more difficult to do the swaps and exchanges? In other words, as everyone gets more comfortable with what they own, or are we seeing it where people are less certain what they own and it is slowing down some of the exchanges? I know you had kind of a 200,000 acre, 80,000 done so far. I'm just curious how that's progressing.\nMike Wirth: Yes, what I would say Roger is, it is one of those unique places where you can drive win wins and because the way the acreage was defined over a 100 years ago and the way it has been held over time, and the technology today with these longer laterals and the value creation through that kind of a development program, it\u2019s in everybody's best interest to find ways to improve their position, and oftentimes in commercial negotiations we\u2019ve got a win lose and that can create a tougher dynamic than one where both parties can realize value. And you sit down at the table and both really have incentives to find a way to do a deal. So, I would say, we may in fact have been a little more difficult to deal with, heretofore simply because of our, let\u2019s go slow to really understand what we\u2019ve got approach to this. And whether you're talking development or you are talking land optimization, there is a lot of activity going on in the basin where we weren't necessarily engaged in as much of it. Now that we are in a position, we feel like we really understand what we want, and where we want to go, and we\u2019re willing to deal. We\u2019ve got numerous conversations underway with counterparties, and I think there is strong reason to believe that we will conclude further value creating transactions this year and into the future.\nRoger Read: Okay, great. Thank you, and I\u2019ll see you next month.\nMike Wirth: Okay. I know we\u2019re just a touch over time here. So, I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. I truly appreciate your interest in Chevron, and everyone's participation in the call. I look forward to seeing many of you in New York in a few weeks. Jonathan, back over to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2017, "date": "2017-10-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Mount, our General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Turning to slide 3. Let me start by revisiting the three messages we delivered in March at our Analyst Day. First, we are growing free cash flow. Third quarter cash flow after dividends, excluding asset sales proceeds, was approximately $500 million. As shown on the chart, including asset sales proceeds, we generated $2.8 billion. Second, we're focused on improving project, book, and cash returns on investment. Projects are coming online, reducing pre-productive capital; and revenue is being realized from growing volumes. Spend is shifting to shorter cycle time, high return investments in base business and shale; and our cost structure is lower. Finally, we're focused on unlocking value from our advantaged and balanced portfolio of opportunities highlighted by legacy positions in Australia, Kazakhstan, and the Permian. Let me now turn the call over to Pat, who'll take you through the financials. I will follow her up with some operational updates and a few closing thoughts.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thanks, John. Starting with slide 4, an overview of our financial performance. Third quarter earnings were $2 billion or $1.03 per diluted share. Included in the quarter was a gain on the sale of our Canadian refining and fuels marketing business of $675 million and charges associated with the project write-off of $220 million. Foreign exchange losses for the quarter were $112 million. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange impact, earnings totaled $1.6 billion or $0.85 per share. Included in this total was a catch-up depreciation adjustment of about $220 million related to our Bangladesh Upstream business, which we have decided to retain. Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.4 billion, reflecting continued strong Downstream performance and the impact of growing volumes and higher realizations in our Upstream business. A working capital draw benefited the quarter, but was mostly offset by an increase in notes receivables. Our debt ratio at quarter-end was just over 22%. Our net debt ratio was approximately 19%. During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we declared $1.08 per share dividend payable in the fourth quarter. We currently yield 3.6%. Turning to slide 5. During the quarter, net cash generated, after C&E and dividends, was $2.8 billion, including $2.3 billion in proceeds from asset sales. Year-to-date, net cash generation after dividends stands at $3.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was $5.4 billion during the third quarter. It was a strong quarter despite approximately $600 million in pension contributions, and affiliate dividends being the lowest we've had this year. Year-to-date, cash from operations has totaled $14.3 billion. Lower affiliate dividends and earnings, working capital consumption of funds, and deferred tax effects, in the aggregate, totaled nearly $3.3 billion through the first nine months. Cash capital expenditures were $3.2 billion for the quarter, approximately $800 million lower than the third quarter 2016. Year-to-date, cash capital expenditures were $9.8 billion, over 30% lower than the same period a year ago. Third quarter asset sale proceeds were approximately $2.3 billion, reflecting the sale of our Canadian refining and fuels marketing business, select Central Basin Platform assets in the Permian, international interest in the Natuna Sea in Indonesia, and gas assets in Trinidad and Tobago. Year-to-date asset sales proceeds now total $4.9 billion. We are confident that we will exceed our objective of being cash balanced this year, including asset sales. Turning to slide 6 now. Slide 6 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2017 earnings were approximately $700 million higher than third quarter 2016 results. Special item, primarily a $675 million gain on the sale of our Canadian refining and fuels marketing business, offset by a project write-off of $220 million, and the absence of special items in the third quarter of 2016, increased earnings by $165 million. A swing in foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings between the periods by $184 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by about $800 million between periods. Higher realizations and increased volumes were partially offset by higher DD&A, both from the increased production and, as previously mentioned, from the catch-up adjustment in Bangladesh. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign-exchange increased by $55 million. Higher global refining margins were partially offset by a swing in timing effects, resulting from rising prices. If we turn now to slide 7. Slide 7 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter of 2017 and third quarter of 2016. Third quarter 2017 production was 2.72 million barrels per day, an increase of more than 200,000 barrels per day over the third quarter of 2016. Major capital projects increased production by 263,000 barrels per day, as we started and ramped up multiple projects, such as Gorgon and Angola LNG. Shale and tight production increased 39,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian. Lower planned turnaround effects, primarily at Tengiz, favorably impacted production between periods by 54,000 barrels per day. Base business growth of 44,000 barrels per day reflected additions from new wells, mostly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria. The impact of asset sales reduced production by 76,000 barrels per day, approximately 45,000 of which were due to 2017 asset sales that impacted third quarter production. Overall, production increases were partially offset by normal field declines and PSC effects. So, I'll now turn it back to John.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay. Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide 8. Our production is growing, as major capital projects come online, the Permian ramps up, and we manage declines in our base operations. At the beginning of the year, we said that production, excluding the effects of 2017 asset sales, would be up 4% to 9% from 2016. At nine months, production before current-year asset sales is up approximately 6% in the middle of the range. We now expect the full-year growth to be in the range of 6% to 8%. The bar on the right shows year-to-date production including the impact of 15,000 barrels a day in 2017 asset sales. We completed our final shallow-water GoM transaction; that's in the Gulf of Mexico. We sold certain Permian properties and divested international interest in Trinidad and the Natuna Sea in Indonesia. We now expect the impact of 2017 asset sales for the full year to be 30,000 barrels a day. As Pat noted, we've canceled the sale of our Bangladesh gas business. Turning to slide 9. Gorgon continues to ramp up. Total production was more than 400,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. We finished a successful maintenance pit stop on Train 1 in early October. The three trains are currently averaging well above nameplate capacity. As we fine-tune the plans to enhance reliability and improve volumes, we'll likely have intermittent downtime on other occasions. At Wheatstone, we announced first LNG production from Train 1 on October 9 and are currently ramping up at 65% of capacity. Loading arms are connected, and we're in the process of loading the first cargo. We expect production to ramp up to full rates over the quarter. We have scheduled downtime to remove temporary strainers in December. Upstream well performance for both projects is at or above expectations. First LNG for Wheatstone Train 2 is scheduled for the second quarter next year. Now, let's turn to the Permian on slide 10. Unconventional production in the Permian continues to exceed expectation. Volume was 187,000 barrels a day in the third quarter, up 30% from third quarter a year ago. Our new basis of design is proving quite effective, and we're standing up our 15th operated rig. A proprietary database contains over 5 million well attributes, encompassing most Permian wells. We continue to apply data analytics and petrophysical technology to that information to drive improvements in well targets and performance. Volume growth is one outcome of our activity. Of course, the more important outcome is the return we generate on the money spent to achieve this volume growth. Earlier this year, we indicated our IRRs on Permian investments were more than 30% at $50 a barrel WTI. I thought it'd be helpful to share information from some recent appropriation requests approved under the new basis of design, and we show that on slide 11. These are fully loaded cost economics. On the left are the operating and financial parameters for three pads currently being developed with 10,000 foot laterals. Based on our type curves and costs, we expect to recover an average of about 1.9 million barrels per well with $14 per barrel capital, operating, and overhead expenditures. At $50 a barrel WTI, $2.50 Henry Hub, and $25 a barrel NGLs, revenue from oil, condensate, and gas streams will weight average $33 per barrel. Our realizations are advantaged by our legacy royalty position and add to strong returns. As you can see by the chart on the right, the typical profile of cumulative cash flow from production allows capital to be recovered very quickly. We expect the average time from initial investment to payback to be about 28 months, and cumulative cash flow over the life of the pad to be nearly two times the capital cost. This is very good use of your money. Capital and operating expenses continue to trend down. Capital expenditures average $4.5 billion per quarter this year, down by more than half from three years ago. Following the normal intra-year pattern, fourth quarter spend will be higher, but we expect full-year capital expenditures will be less than $19 billion. We're also controlling operating and administrative expense as well. Average quarterly costs are down again this year, about $450 million per quarter lower than last year, despite higher Upstream production and 22% lower than 2014. We expect unit cost in the Upstream to continue the downward trend. Turning to slide 13. Last year, I indicated we plan to sell $5 billion to $10 billion worth of assets in 2016 and 2017 combined. Through seven quarters, we've sold $7.7 billion, squarely in the middle of the range. In the third quarter, we closed the sale of our Canadian refining and fuels marketing business and the Upstream assets I noted earlier. We expect no significant asset sales in the fourth quarter. In South Africa, our minority shareholders exercised their right of first refusal and plan to purchase our refining and marketing assets there. We now expect this sale to close in 2018. Our criteria for asset sales hasn't changed and is listed on the chart. Before taking your question, I'll offer a few closing thoughts. As you know, I've announced my retirement effective February 1, so this'll be my last earnings call. The financial community judges CEOs by TSR, and I'm gratified that we outperformed our peers during my tenure. That's an outcome my two predecessors established as a precedent, and we certainly owe much of our success in this long-cycle time business to those that came before us. During my time we're seen tremendous volatility in price and cost conditions. On my first day on the job, back in 2010, oil was $80 a barrel and Henry Hub was over $6 per MCF. Today, of course, prices are much lower, and that's impacted industry results and produced TSRs that have lagged the S&P 500 Index. But the company has weathered the downturn, adjusted rapidly to new conditions, and is well-positioned for the future. Including our fourth quarter declared dividend of $1.08, we've now increased the annual per-share cash payout 30 years in a row, a record that is very important to us. We've also repurchased shares when it was prudent and have been conscious not to dilute the share count. As you've seen in the results, we're at a cash flow inflection point, with spending coming down and revenue from growing production going up. With the fourth quarter at current prices, we should be close to cash balanced without asset sales proceeds this year. We have an Upstream business that I believe can sustain itself at current prices, thanks to an enviable unconventional position highlighted but not limited to the Permian. I expect Australia will deliver earnings and cash flow for decades, and we've had a successful record developing a huge resource base in Kazakhstan. We have a tightly configured high-return Downstream and Chemical business that complements the Upstream. Most importantly, we've got a wonderful management team, organization, and culture. You know Mike Wirth and his team well. They're typical of the talented and effective people that make up our 50,000 employees. Mike has a track record of success, and I know he'll do an outstanding job for you. With that, I'll take your questions. So, Jonathan, please open the lines for those questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of James (sic) [Jason] Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nJason Gammel: Yeah. I think that's me, folks. Hi, everyone.\nJohn S. Watson: Jason.\nJason Gammel: First of all, John, I'd like to congratulate you \u2013 thanks. First of all, John, I'd like to congratulate you on your highly successful tenure as CEO. You left things in great shape for Mike. And as a former Chevron guy, I've got a strong appreciation for the mark you've left on the company, so best wishes in all your future endeavors.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you much, Jason.\nJason Gammel: First question, John. Pretty significant major milestones achieved over the quarter, with first LNG startup at Wheatstone, Gorgon at full economic capacity. Now, that you're transitioning from construction to operation, can you talk a little bit about some of the lessons that you've learned since you embarked on this big expansion in Australia, given that it spanned most of your tenure?\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. Jason, there are a lot of lessons we've learned. We went to FID back in 2009 on this project. And a lot of the engineering work was done 10 years ago; a lot of the project planning work was done 10 years ago. And I think it's fair to say, we, in the industry, have learned a number of things during that time. I think the real lessons are around the assurance work we need to do and the preparatory work. We had a lot of reviews of, say, Gorgon when we started. And it was labeled by independent reviewers, the best prepared mega-project out there. And it's pretty clear that we needed to do more engineering in advance, and we needed to have better assurance work on some of the project planning and other aspects of the project. It's a complex project on Barrow Island. And if you miss a few things, you're going to incur some additional costs. So, we've learned from that and learned from what we've done and others have done. And we've tried to make some of those changes going forward on projects like FGP and elsewhere. So, there certainly have been learnings. And I think in a broad sense, we have to verify every single aspect of these projects in advance, because we're on the hook for them, regardless of the kind of contract that we sign. So, if a vendor or a contractor doesn't perform, or there's some element that we've not thoroughly vetted, and during construction, we have to verify these things. We have to be sure that what we order gets delivered. We have to be sure that the designs are robust. We have to be sure of everything. And I think we had a different mindset going back a decade ago.\nJason Gammel: That's great. And it's actually a good segue to my follow-up question. Thanks for the financial data on the Permian. With the baseline moving into more of a manufacturing mode, can you talk a little bit about the advantages that scale and the strong balance sheet give you relative to smaller competitors?\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. When you look at the Permian and you look at Chevron, we have a portfolio of products. So, we're generating cash flow from each individual investment that we make in the Permian. But that's a team effort, really. We have a strong procurement organization. We have a technical organization that supports our people in the Permian. And we have learnings that we're generating. We've talked a lot about data science, but there's more to it than that, that's enabling us to learn from others, so that we can really spend our money very efficiently. We showed some charts last quarter that showed how we process the information from others. And we think we came up with the learning curve pretty fast. We're drilling fewer wells. And it's that kind of capability that I think is advantageous to us. Also, we have a portfolio, where different assets have different roles. For example, right now, we can choose to pace how much we spend in the Permian. I showed you a chart that showed the kinds of returns that we have there, so we can scale that. We're continuing on our ramp up to 20 rigs, but we have the ability to ramp that up and really manage the cash flow as a portfolio. Overall, my view is the work we do, whether it's procurement or advantage royalty position, the integration that we have with our supply and trading organization, the technology, all those things are something that a big company can bring. And I think we're showing that in the results that we've been metering out to you, guys, every quarter.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Jason.\nJason Gammel: I agree with that. All the best, John.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please\nPaul Sankey: Good morning, everyone.\nFrank Mount: Hey, Paul.\nJohn S. Watson: Hey, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: John, we first met a long time ago, when you were the CFO. And I just want to thank you for the time and the patience you showed in dealing with guys like me, and congratulate you on your retirement. We really can't argue with shareholder return as a measure, so enjoy. You've got me slightly fantasizing about retiring myself, but unfortunately, it's a long way off. With all that said, John, this result was pretty weak, if we look at cash flow, if we look at EPS, if we look at volumes. If we could just focus perhaps \u2013 and by the way, there was a tremendous positive element here, which was the Permian slides. But if we could just focus on the cash flow, is there anything that you would highlight that made it look as weak as it did? Because I think we were a bit negatively surprised, quite frankly.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah. I saw how the stock opened, and I must say I was surprised, because underneath that I think we're doing pretty well. And so, it won't surprise you, Paul, if we have a little bit of a disagreement on this. But, in fairness, not all of it was apparent to you in the numbers. So, let me talk through a couple of things, and I'll also let Pat make a comment. On earnings, earnings were $0.85 a share. We didn't call the Bangladesh catch-up depreciation adjustment a special item. Basically, what happens here is when you declare an asset that's going to be sold, you suspend depreciation. When you decide not to sell it, you have to reinstate it, so that was some $220 million. We terminated a rig contract, which is $150 million before tax, and so that appeared in the numbers. We've also got some things going on in working capital that don't impact earnings per se. And I'm going to let Pat walk you through a couple of those.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. I mean, two things on the cash flow side I would mention is, one, the pension contribution. I called out a number of $600 million in total, but $500 million of that was discretionary, and the first one that we've made in \u2013 all year, so that is a quarterly impact. $600 million in total, $500 discretionary. The second thing I would mention is \u2013 and we did mention it here, but we did have a circumstance where one of our partners \u2013 as you might expect over the last three years, there's been some difficulty in some of our partners actually paying us what they owe us. So, during the quarter, we were successful in negotiating more security around that ultimate payment, but it meant having a swap between what was the current receivable into a notes receivable. So, you ended up having a positive working capital effect in the quarter of about $600 million as we recognized this reclassification from a accounts receivable to a notes receivable. So, when you look at our 10-Q statement, and you look at what's happened in notes receivable, you will see there was no cash flow impact during the quarter for that. It did impact working capital, however.\nJohn S. Watson: So, what you're saying is the working capital adjustment is a touch misleading...\nPatricia E. Yarrington: It is.\nJohn S. Watson: ...during the quarter. And really the news was good, because we were able to provide better security around arrear and arrear from one of our national company partners.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: So, if you kind of look through that, you're really talking about our cash from operations, I think, on a headline basis and adding back the $500 million discretionary pension contribution. That gets you close to a $6 billion figure.\nPaul Sankey: Great. And, John, in all sincerity, thanks, and congratulations.\nJohn S. Watson: Paul, thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. And, John, congratulations.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you.\nNeil Mehta: John, first, a big picture question. The energy sector broadly hasn't created a lot of value over the last 10 years. Now, a lot of that has to do with commodity price, but a lot of that has to do with capital allocation. Your stock has been one of the better performers. So, sort of handing off the baton question, what's your message to the CEOs of the energy industry, whether it's the next-generation of major CEOs, many of which would come from Downstream or the shale E&Ps.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, if you look at our TSR since I started, just under 10%, but that's lagged the S&P which, of course, gets heavily weighted by the FANG stocks. But there's no getting away from the fact that I think we missed on the commodity side which was largely a miss on technology. If you look at miracle of hydraulic fracturing that's taken place really since 2010, that's put supply on the market that we didn't anticipate. And so, I think the message really is that we're a pretty resilient bunch in this business. And when prices go up, technology keeps moving, and we're able to respond to that very well as an industry. So, never underestimate that ingenuity, if you will, because we're very, very good at what we do. Our industry doesn't get a lot of attention as a technology industry, but clearly, we have been, and that resulted in a transition. So, we are in a commodity price business. We really have to focus on the lowest-cost projects and opportunities that we have regardless of the ups and downs that we'll see on a transitory basis in the commodity market. I suspect, Neil, that if we had commodity prices that were in the range that most of us anticipated, we would all have performed a lot better. And the message is be a little bit wiser about the quantity of projects that you take on; be very wary of the capabilities in the supply chain during those busy times that I commented on earlier; and pursue your best opportunities. And that's what we are doing right now. You know well, we talk a lot about the Permian. But Vaca Muerta, you've seen a little bit in the press, is performing very well. The Duvernay for us is good, the Marcellus. We've got four big shale opportunities that are very low cost. We've got continuing base business opportunities. And we're trying to drive down the costs in some of the longer cycle time projects. But the emphasis will be on getting a lot out of the assets that we have, particularly during this period, where commodity prices are \u2013 maybe lower than many have anticipated.\nNeil Mehta: I appreciate that, John. And then follow-up just around 2018 CapEx. Recognizing you're going to give us more color here in a couple of weeks with the December capital spending release, but just how are you thinking about the drivers going into 2018 relative to the $17 billion to $22 billion band that's out there?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah. We indicated that if prices stayed in the kind of \u2013 near $50 range that we would be toward the bottom of that $17 billion top $22 billion range. And I see no reason to modify that guidance. That will certainly be the case. A couple of things I'll highlight for next year, and it'll be \u2013 we've got our plan approved in early December, I expect. And we'd put out a C&E release after that. Next year will be the peak year. Next year, 2018/2019 will be the peak spending time for the future growth project in Kazakhstan, and of course, we'll continue to fund the Permian. But nothing has changed that will drive us away from the bottom \u2013 toward the bottom of that range.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, John. Good luck with your handicap.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Neil.\nJohn S. Watson: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please?\nPhil M. Gresh: Yes. Good morning. And I echo everybody's sentiments. Congratulations, John.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Phil.\nPhil M. Gresh: First question is just, as I look at the production trends over the past couple of quarters, if you look at that base plus shale piece, it's been pretty flattish. And I think at the analyst day, you actually expected it to be more like minus 2% this year. And it would take a couple years for that to get to kind of a 0 to plus 1% trendline. So, maybe you could just elaborate on why you've been able to outperform that base plus shale expectation? And how do you roll that forward and think about the outlook for the next few years?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, I think the outlook is nothing but good. If I think about, first, the base business, our people are very focused on getting the most out of the assets that they have, so certainly, that has been a positive. And so, with infill drilling program, development well drilling off of our hosts in deep water, et cetera, has been very successful for us. So, that is certainly a positive. And then you see the Permian and shale results have been good. So, I made a comment in my closing remarks that I think we're sustainable for a good period of time at lower prices. And that was sort of a code for what you're describing. I think we'll be in a position to grow production for a period of years, just from the shale, frankly, and the projects that are continuing to come online and ramp up. So, I think that's very positive. We'll go through our normal cycle with you, where on the fourth quarter earnings call, we'll give you an estimate for production for next year. But I think looking forward, with the continuing ramp-up of major capital projects and the success we're seeing in the Permian and elsewhere, it'll be a good news story.\nPhil M. Gresh: Okay. Thanks. Second question just on the dividend, obviously, acknowledging the long-term track record. I think some investors maybe were a little bit surprised not to see a modest bump with the dividend in the fourth quarter, as we lap last year's fourth-quarter tweak up. So, maybe you could just share your thoughts on that in the context of the broader picture?\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. I said in my closing remarks, we like the dividend, and we like it a lot. The board likes it, and every member of management that I know likes increasing the dividend. And you've heard me overtime, we've said we'll increase it as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. I've also said that we want to be sure that any increase in the dividend is ultimately sustainable. I said, I wouldn't knowingly increase the dividend if I didn't think we could sustain it in perpetuity. So, we put a high bar on increases. And I'll say, the story inside the company is very good. We chose not to increase the dividend this quarter, in large part, based on the time of year that it is and the potential risks that we see in the marketplace in the fourth quarter and early part of next year. There's uncertainty around OPEC, and there's just always uncertainty in the marketplace. Having said that, if you look at where prices are today, it may have been a conservative call, to be honest. But the great thing about the dividend is we get an opportunity to reconsider it every 90 days. And so, our board will take a close look at it every quarter. And I'll remind everyone that we've increased it 30 years in a row, the annual per share cash payout. And I expect that, that'll be a priority going forward.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Phil.\nPhil M. Gresh: Thanks, John. Congratulations.\nJohn S. Watson: Phil, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, John. Good morning, everybody. And John, I'm going to add my congratulations also. I'm in the same generation as (31:40) CFO timeline. So, thanks for putting up with us for the last 15 years. We really appreciate it.\nJohn S. Watson: All good, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: It looks like you're going out on a high with oil price above $60, but relatively speaking anyway. All right, so two questions, both high-level, John. I'm going to apologize for not asking any specifics about the quarter, but your legacy has been to establish or maybe be the \u2013 you kind of managed through the establishment of a very large legacy asset base, this obviously driving this inflation in cash flow. Mike's worst (32:18) track record has been something of a cost-cutting asset sales generator in the Downstream. I'm just wondering, given the succession planning on the continuity of strategy, with the flexibility in the Permian, how do you see those two things coming together as Mike steps? And what I'm really getting at is do you think there's an opportunity for a more aggressive resizing of Chevron's portfolio, given that those major changes have taken place? And I've got a follow up, please.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, Doug, that is a broad question. And I think it's certainly true that during my tenure, we've had some significant capital projects, and we've seen a wild ride in the commodity cycle markets. I do think those investments give Chevron a lot to work on. I'd describe it internally as we have a lot to chew on over the next few years. So, what do I mean by that? What it means is Gorgon and Wheatstone, for example, we have to ramp those up, fine-tune them, get the most out of those young assets and then debottleneck them over time. So, I would describe that as sort of a base business type activity. We have a Permian business that has a lot of momentum behind it. And we have other assets, other fresh assets, that have been or will be coming online that will give us a lot to work on for incremental returns over time. And those incremental efforts and outlays of capital will, in general, be smaller. And they'll likely have higher returns, because they're building off existing infrastructure. So, I think it's a wonderful opportunity. And certainly Mike is very familiar with that, because one of the things the Downstream business has done well, all downstreamers have done, and Mike did an exceptional job, is really they've been penny-pinchers in that sense. And they've learned how to eke more out of the refineries. And I think that's exactly what we want to do with our assets. But I think it undersells Mike to describe him as just a cost-cutter, because actually, there have been opportunities to grow in the Downstream business that we've taken advantage of over time. And I think that Mike has been a part of our leadership team, my leadership team, for a long time. He's been in leadership positions elsewhere, so there will be elements of growth likely over his period of time. But I don't think it will be \u2013 whether it was Mike or somebody else, I don't think it would be this big period of additions to the capital base that I went through. But I would encourage you to think about Mike as being certainly great at grinding returns out of the business, but also very balanced in his capabilities. You got a chance to talk to him. You know he's a very broad guy.\nDoug Leggate: Well, we're looking forward to it. But we'll miss you just the same, John. So, my follow up is \u2013 I'm going to have a little fun with you now, because I think as you walk away, I think you've been quoted multiple times as the prospect of peak oil demand, I think, wishful thinking is probably, putting it kindly, as to what your response was. I wonder if I could just ask you as you walk away to offer your thoughts on the commodity outlook and this concept of peak oil demand that seems to be current fashion.\nJohn S. Watson: Sure. Well, I just try to speak factually about what I see out there. And I am an unabashed advocate for our industry. Our industry is responsible for the greatest advancements in living standard in recorded history. And literally, light, heat, mobility, mechanized agriculture, everything that we have, every shred of our standard of living, has been provided by our industry, if you look back 100 years ago. So, that's the context in the statements that I make. And the comments on demand are simply, I'm just repeating what the International Energy Administration and others state. In fact, if you look at our demand forecast going forward, they're very similar to those of our competitors'. So, when people talk about peak oil, they're simply not looking at facts and data for the foreseeable future. Now, technology advances, and that's a good thing. And there will be other forms of energy that will come into the energy mix. But I think good debate on energy policy starts with a good grounding of the facts. And peak oil will happen at some point. But for the foreseeable future, as the developing world puts in place economic systems to generate the kind of standard of living that we have and the infrastructure that's associated with it, it's pretty clear that oil demand is going to grow. In fact, demand estimates for next year are up again. We're getting close to 100 million barrels a day. Natural gas demand is growing and our products are needed. And we have to be able to provide them in an environmentally safe way and an environmentally responsible way, but we really ought to have deeper debate on these subjects based on a well-grounded set of facts. And so, that's where I come from when I make the kind of comments that I do.\nFrank Mount: Thank you, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate your viewpoint. Thanks again. Good luck, John.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital. Your question, please.\nPaul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nFrank Mount: Hey, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: John, I want to add my congratulations.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you.\nPaul Cheng: I think that you make me feel really old because I think I met you more than 20 years ago, so that has been...\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah.\nPaul Cheng: ...a wild ride. So, really appreciate that.\nJohn S. Watson: You're seasoned. You're seasoned, Paul. You're not old.\nPaul Cheng: That is a very nice term. But anyway, really want to say congratulations, and thank you for putting up with all the nasty (38:05). I really appreciate it. So, with that, maybe I have two questions. First, if we look at the industry, we've been nearly constantly going through the boom and bust. Partly, it's probably related to the normal commodity cycle, which naturally that is going to have volatility like that. But I'm wondering, you said also partly is because the industry, how it is being managed or that is being compensate. So, I mean, as you're departing and go to the retirement, John, when you look at the industry, do you think the way to how it's being managed or how it's being compensate need to be changed, or with the cycle, it's just naturally going to be here and not much can be done?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, I think that's, in many ways, a company-specific question, because if you look at our comp system, we've had a pretty balanced compensation system for a long time. And for those that aren't aware, there are really four big components to it. One is a salary that's based on competitive data. Two is a current year cash bonus, which is based on a scorecard. And I would invite anyone to take a look at Chevron's scorecard. And it has a variety of things in it, including returns in that scorecard, and so, whether it's health, environment, and safety project progress and things of that sort. Now, we've enhanced our disclosure on that in recent years, but I think it sets a standard. So, that's for the current year cash bonus. And then we have two other long-term components that really are 100% aligned with shareholder return. The first is a relative TSR performance unit. And just last year, we added the S&P 500 as one of our competitors. But that is married up with, what for the most part in the past has been, options that have been given, which again, is lined with absolute shareholder performance over time. And the thinking behind those components for us has been that you will have these ups and downs. And so, if in an absolute sense, we don't perform well, options won't return much. If in a relative way, we outperform all of our competitors, we'll get that component. But if the downtime for the industry, you won't realize value from the options. And so, it's really quite balanced, but it's very returns-focused, whether it's TSR-focused or returns-focused in the scorecard for the current year, along with other current-year performance information. The outcomes that we've achieved have largely been a function of the commodity price environment. We made $26 billion when oil was high, and we made nothing when oil was $42. And so it's been a volatile ride. But if you look at those components together over time, I think ours has been a good system. I think there's a wide range out there in industry. And, look, I read the same articles you do. And I've read some of the proxies and some of the information that other companies put out there. And I think you're seeing a response to that by shareholders and by management.\nPaul Cheng: The second one, don't know whether you want to comment, but seems that you're retiring, you may. What would be your advice to the high official in a number of oil-producing countries? The way they \u2013 how they manage the industry and \u2013 or how the oil revenue is being \u2013 I mean, not to mention how oil revenue is being managed inside, but how their relationship with the oil industry, and how they can do better in terms of attracting the investment dollar?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, Paul, as you know, I mean, we talk a lot about the strain on the private companies, like Chevron, during this period of lower prices and the adjustment we've had to make. And I've said on previous calls, host governments are going through the exact same type of change. The difference is we have dividends; they have social spending as commitments that they have. And so, they're wrestling with lower revenues, they've made commitments to their people, and they've got trade-offs to make. And so, I think they're in the process of making those trade-offs. The advice would only be that it's a competitive world out there, and so when I talk to heads of state or governments, we are economic agents and we respond to the incentives that are out there, so putting in place a system that's going to draw capital, be viewed as stable over time is very important. And we're seeing some countries that are responding to that. We're seeing others that aren't. And when they don't respond, when it's not economic, private companies walk with their feet. And so these transitions can take time because of these trade-offs that governments have between keeping the cash and not adjusting the fiscal terms and adjusting the terms to draw capital, so that we can make the kind of long-term investments that'll deliver benefits over a longer period of time for their country. And so, those are the things that I think have to be considered. And most governments eventually gets there.\nPaul Cheng: Well, congratulation, and hope you have a lot of fun in your retirement.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Paul.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you. Appreciate it, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question, please?\nDoug Terreson: Well, first, John, congratulations on your stock beating every peer during your...\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: ...tenure and over 5 and 10 years. But I don't think you need any help with your handicap.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: I think that's pretty good. So, my question is, Chevron had this pledge to focus on returns on capital employed and free cash flow, which you guys highlight on page 3. And it's had a long history of positive shareholder outcomes. Simultaneously though, a lot of times, investment discipline will falter as surplus capital materializes. And Chevron looks likely to have a lot of surplus capital during the next couple of years. So, my question is how significant do you consider the challenge to manage this transition to be? And besides some of the commentary that you and Pat made on spending and distributions, are there any other thing that we should focus on which underscore Chevron's commitment to value creation going forward?\nJohn S. Watson: I don't want to advertise that my successor's going to have an easy time, because there will be challenges that the industry will face going forward. But I think we're in a good place right now, because we do have projects coming online and more that are coming. They are going to deliver cash flow. I actually think that there's a very high chance that we'll be very disciplined for a whole variety of reasons. One, the opportunity set that we have tends to be shorter-cycle opportunities that we've highlighted by the shale. Second, if you compare the current period with the period, say, 10 years ago, we knew we had a number of major capital project opportunities coming up and that were in the hopper. And I won't relive the history of timing of funding of Gorgon and Wheatson, Jack/St. Malo and some of the other large projects that we have had, but we clearly don't have that array of gigantic projects coming up. We are funding in a counter-cyclical way, the FGP project, in a place we've been very successful in Kazakhstan. But the number of projects that we have going forward, the die is reasonably well cast over the next few years. In other words, there's not some $20 billion or $30 billion project expenditure that's progressed to the point that would likely get funded during this period. So, I think the discipline will be pretty clear. And, in fact, Mike will have the opportunity to give you an update on that capital spending range at our normal meeting in March.\nDoug Terreson: Okay. Well, listen, Chevron is set up well. Congratulations, again, John.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you very much, Doug.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nEvan Calio: Hey, good afternoon.\nJohn S. Watson: Hey, Evan.\nEvan Calio: I want to congratulate both Mike, I'm sure he is listening, and echo the congratulations, John, on your tenure. It's been a pleasure working with you, and I wish you the best.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you, Evan.\nEvan Calio: My first question, bigger picture. I know, John, you've been a strategic thinker. You've been involved in acquisitions of Unocal, as well as the Chesapeake acreage and others. I think last month, Chevron made a compelling case that the majors can really win in unconventionals. And my question is what do you think that the U.S. shale industry structure looks like in five years? I know it's less necessary for Chevron, but do you think that, that industry will significantly consolidate over time, or any thoughts there would be interesting.\nJohn S. Watson: I do expect there to be some consolidation. I think a lot of the work that's going on now, a lot of the land work that's taking place certainly for us, but for many others as well is, we call it coring up, but it's really making sure that you've got contiguous acreage positions, so that you can drill up the kinds of laterals that you want to drill, put in place the infrastructure that you want, so that you can deliver good returns very efficiently. And so, I do think that there will be that focus. And we're engaged in a number of different \u2013 I mean, frankly, we've got dozens of different transactions that are under way to do just that, and we've highlighted that. One of them will be broader consolidation. I think it depends a lot on valuations. Now, valuations have come back into line recently, so it may create some of that opportunity. From our way of thinking, when it comes to M&A, we like the positions we've had. I've made it pretty clear in the past that we don't have to do any particular acquisition at this time, but at the same time, I've also said that we're in a resource business. And so, whether it's adding volume through exploration, discovered resource, or M&A, we'll likely participate in all those things. And so, if there were a bolt-on opportunity, we'd consider it. But it really would be driven by, how does it fit? I mean, the question I always ask our people when we do M&A is, what do we know that the market doesn't, and how can we add value that wasn't contemplated here. And so, anytime we would engage in a transaction, I would encourage you to ask us that question, because that's the question that we ask ourselves.\nEvan Calio: Great. And John, there's always room for a Watson's pack (49:07) out there, if you choose to follow your peers and not work on the handicap. My second question is on the Permian, more detailed in your slide 11. Can you give any color on what percentage of your 2017 or 2018 programs will be this new well design? And any indication on how that affects your guidance, which I presume was predicated on the prior completion design?\nJohn S. Watson: I think it's virtually all of it is under this new design. We've been migrating to that design. This chart, I hope, was helpful to you, because it's really three pads that we've had. And we monitor the type curves and the performance against them. These are 10,000 foot laterals. There are some that won't necessarily be 10,000-foot laterals, but that's certainly what we're striving for in most areas.\nEvan Calio: Got it. Good luck. Thank you\nJohn S. Watson: Okay. Thank you, Evan.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Evan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo Securities. Your question, please.\nRoger D. Read: Yeah. Good morning, and congratulations, John. It's certainly been a solid run.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Roger.\nRoger D. Read: Hey. I just wanted to follow up. Pat, this actually maybe a question more for you. In the presentation, the change in depreciation, which I'm sure is driven mostly by Gorgon and the coming Wheatstone, is that accurate? And is that the right way to think about \u2013 obviously, a little less large, but the impacts of Wheatstone coming forward as well?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. I mean, a lot of it would be production volumetrically related. I do call you back to the Bangladesh depreciation catch-up component that was in there in this quarter for $220 million. But the fundamental underlying components are going to be related to volumetric increases that we've had quarter-to-quarter. It depends on which period you're looking at. Third-to-third, of course, up significantly. Second to third is not exactly the same scenario, but that's where the Bangladesh catch-up shows itself.\nRoger D. Read: Okay. Great. And then as a follow up to that, as we think about the slide on the Permian and all, and obviously, very attractive F&D and ultimate depreciation cost there, does that trend down overall for the company, or is the Permian not likely to be large enough for that to be the case over the next couple of years?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, let me think. Overall, there's a balance between depreciation that's coming on from the new projects from Gorgon and Wheatstone, which we've said are largely between $20 and $25 a barrel; and then the ramping down of depreciation that's taking place in the Permian and unconventional business. And I flagged that last quarter going down from, say, $19 a barrel down to $13, and frankly even lower than that, as we move forward with this new base of design and more volumes at lower cost coming into the mix. Maybe I'll defer on what the exact number will be each year, and we can come back to a little bit of guidance in that way. We haven't...\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Finished our...\nJohn S. Watson: We haven't finalized our plan, but you're correct that it's a weight between those two.\nRoger D. Read: Okay. That's great. Thank you.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Roger.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Roger.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber from Simmons. Your question, please.\nGuy Baber: Good morning, everybody. And, John, just echoing everyone else's comments, congrats on a great run here.\nJohn S. Watson: Thank you much.\nGuy Baber: I wanted to circle back to the CapEx kind of framework. But as we think about the level of spending right now going to your base upstream assets, so setting aside your shale and type (53:01) program and the spending associated with major projects, how comfortable are you with the current spending level for those assets just in terms of sufficiency to sustain the base? And really, just trying to understand if you see a need to step up that base spending level or not, given the efficiencies, which you seem to continue to realize, and maybe how much flexibility there might be with oil prices where they are right now.\nJohn S. Watson: Well, if you look at the base level spend, it's been \u2013 we've categorized it, excluding the major capital projects that are part of that base, it's been about $6 billion a year. So, we've been kind of at the bottom of that range. In our guidance going forward, we will have projects that will be associated with some of these new assets. So, you'll call that base \u2013 there will be base level of spend. Some of these base projects are not trivial in the sense that some of the deep water well programs that are off existing hosts and things like that are there. But I think what you'll see is a higher component, a higher percentage of our spend will be in the category of base and shale type spend going forward. In terms of the precise number, maybe we'll defer until we give you that \u2013 we'll give you that usual split that we do in March, but the general trend is in the direction that you described. And certainly, it's driven by economics.\nGuy Baber: Okay. That's great. And then at the risk of getting into the weeds here, on cash flow, as we dial in our 2018 cash flow and free cash flow expectations, just in light of some of the year-to-date headwinds, can you speak at all to some of those less-obvious drivers of free cash flow next year that might be hard for us to see but important to consider? And just thinking if there's any high-level observations perhaps around the evolution of deferred tax or potential tax refunds, given where oil prices are right now, necessary contributions to TCO that might or may not be needed. And maybe even a step down in pension payments next year, given the discretionary contribution. But just wondering if you can put any color there.\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, let me make an overall comment about cash flow. There often are some things that are difficult to see. We've given you guidance on how sensitive we are to oil prices, for example. And we've said it's $350 million per $1, but the devil's in the detail on that, and particularly, depending upon the range of prices that it's covering. For example, right now, if we happen to have negative taxable income, the leverage is higher in a particular jurisdiction. So, I think that's part of why we've said that we are exposed to the upside to commodity prices. But we do have \u2013 I do urge some caution in the sense that we have a major affiliate, for example, in Kazakhstan that is incurring spending that runs through the affiliate and that can impact dividend or capital contributions to that company. It's not the normal consolidated operations, so those kinds of things can impact us. And Pat can make a couple of other comments.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, I'd just say, if you're thinking about the future, I mean, pension contributions we look at every year. At least in terms of the U.S. pension plan, we're not in a statutory requirement to make a funding. But in the past, you will see over time that we have up to $500 million, or in healthier days spent $1 billion per year. So, that is a consideration that we will look at every year, but it's completely discretionary. John mentioned the affiliate component of things. The other one that I would highlight on a deferred tax basis, we have been in a position where our deferred tax has been a headwind for us this year and in the last couple of years. As I look forward, obviously, prices will be a huge impact as to when those, in fact, reverse. But if you look at reasonable price ranges around what we've had here, in the $50s, say, I think you should anticipate that that will take some time for that cash benefit to come back into our actual cash coffers. So, it will be a bleed out over time, where the net operating losses that are creating these tax cash carry-forwards, in fact, get monetized. But it's a pretty slow bleed-off if you're looking at prices around today's.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Guy.\nGuy Baber: Yeah, thank you, all.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks. And I'll echo all those before me in passing on my congratulations, John. It's been great, and good luck with what's next.\nJohn S. Watson: Thanks, Ryan.\nRyan Todd: Maybe a question. You've touched a little bit on this on various questions earlier, but a number of your integrated peers, including your U.S. peer who also reported this morning, have been relatively active over the last couple years in global asset markets acquiring resources in global LNG, Brazil, or various locations. You guys have remained relatively on the sidelines through most of this. I mean, can you talk about how your thinking about managing investment priorities, not just for the next few years, but also how you view in terms of how your portfolio is positioned post-2020, and whether your decision to kind of stay on the sidelines through much of this over the last couple years represents \u2013 is it just portfolio positioning relative to what you think you have, or is it a slight shift in investment philosophy longer-term?\nJohn S. Watson: Well, I think it's been a couple of things, Ryan. One is, as you say, it's the portfolio. We've got a very good portfolio. We've got 1.5 million acres in the Permian; we've got a lot to do and to digest there and the other unconventional positions. So, we have a good resource base position. And we have growth ahead over the next few years, as we continue to bring on these projects and develop them and grow the shale. So, one, we do have a good position. As you point out, you do have to add resource over time, and that's why I made the comment that I did earlier. But I'll tell you, we look at what's going to compete for capital in the portfolio against the opportunities that we have. And for much of this time period, over the last few years, there's been, let's say, an imbalance between the expectations of buyers and sellers. And so, you can't always reach commercial agreement, or you may just see things that are out of the money. And so, we've been very cognizant of that. Now, I highlighted earlier that \u2013 and I've said in previous calls that we have a watching brief on a lot of different opportunities, whether they're asset-level transactions or companies. And so, we do watch that very carefully. And over time, we do need to add assets to our portfolio. But we've made some choices based on costs. We exited the Australian Bight, a difficult decision. We've got a good relationship with the government, but that wasn't going to compete for capital going forward. So, we're really trying to be true to what we told you, where we're being returns-focused, and we're spending our money on what we think will be most economic.\nRyan Todd: Good. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe a follow up on the chemicals side of the business? I mean, you continue to see potential expansions talked about in the chemicals industry, particularly, in the U.S. Gulf Coast. I know you guys have a cracker starting up here early next year. But can you talk about maybe what you view as future growth opportunities on that side of the business within CPChem? How aggressive you'd like to be and whether your Permian position \u2013 whether you think it allows for a certain amount of integration across the value chain there?\nJohn S. Watson: Yes. Well, as all of you know, we've got a good relationship with Phillips. And Chevron Phillips Chemical Company is a primary vehicle through which we invest in petrochemicals. And so, that relationship is good. We do have the plant that's \u2013 the derivatives are on-stream, and the ethylene plant's coming on early next year, so we do have that. And we have contemplated other expansions with them. I think it's fair to say that the economics of those have the potential to be good. And certainly the continued growth of NGLs and the growth in the Permian, I think, is going to contribute to an advantage feedstock position for a long time to come. But with the overall drop in prices that we seen and the impact of NAFTA, it's tighter than it was previously. But I expect \u2013 I mean our focus right now is getting the project we've got online, getting through that storm damage, and bringing the second phase of the project up. And then we'll consider the other opportunities.\nRyan Todd: Great.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Ryan.\nRyan Todd: Thank you.\nFrank Mount: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Your question, please.\nAnish Kapadia: Hi. Yeah, my first question was on exploration. You've called out for some frontier areas. You mentioned to buy, I think, in the Senegal and Mauritania area as well. I just wondered how do you think about the role of exploration and resource replenishment going forward? And how do you see exploration stacking up relative to mine resource in the current market?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah. I think you'll see us putting more money into existing basins where we have a lot of expertise. So, for example, there will be a focus for us on the Gulf of Mexico, pending conditions, Nigeria's perspective, and some of our existing basins, I think. Look, remote areas, whether it's Arctic or Australian Bight or others, are just not likely to compete for capital. Believe it or not, we do have a little bit of exploration work that we'll do to continue our appraisal and assessment of some of our unconventional positions that are out there, but if you look at where resource ads are coming from and where reserve ads are coming from, I think you're going to continue to see strong contributions from our four unconventional businesses going forward.\nAnish Kapadia: Thank you. And then I had one follow-up. It feels like we're bottoming out in terms of costs in the international markets to some extent as well. So, from that regard, I was wondering if you could give some kind of update on the potential FIDs that you thought to take. I'm thinking about Rosebank, Tigris, Anchor in the Gulf of Mexico and some projects in Indonesia. Are any of these likely to be FID-ed in 2018, if you can account the costs where you want them, and do you have the capsule (01:04:38) availability to do it?\nJohn S. Watson: Yeah, it's a good question. I think we've gotten \u2013 we're working very hard. For example, Anchor and Tigris, in the Gulf of Mexico, those are in the concept development stage. So, we're not in feed yet with those projects. And a lot of the work that we're doing, for example, is to qualify equipment for the pressure regimes that we'll see. So, there's industry work to achieve some of the milestones in that area. At the same time, we have really joint teams that are working those two developments to see if we can really design once and have enough commonality in design for not only those two projects but for others in the industry, working with vendors to try to really do what we've talked about for a long time, which to better standardize the development schemes to bring the cost down. That work continues on those projects, and so \u2013 they're not in feed yet, so you wouldn't expect to see FID. Rosebank has been in feed and has been working very hard and diligently on both the concept and the cost. And they continue to make good progress, but I think it's fair to say that in a $50 world, we've got strong opportunities in the unconventional space and elsewhere. And so, we're continuing to work that project. It's a good opportunity for us, but there's more work yet to do.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Anish.\nJohn S. Watson: Okay. I think that concludes my prepared remarks for today. I certainly appreciate the very kind words that all of you stated. I've enjoyed my coming up on eight years in the role. I appreciate the dialogue that I've had with both the sell side and the buy side. And I'll look forward to the afterlife. So, I wish you all the best. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2017, "date": "2017-07-28 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. Good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown here on slide two. I'll begin with a discussion of our second quarter 2017 financial results and Jay will then provide an update on our Upstream business prior to my concluding remarks. Turning now to slide three, an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $1.5 billion or $0.77 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $430 million as well as asset sale gains of $160 million. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange gains of $3 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $1.7 billion or $0.91 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Cash from operations for the quarter was $5 billion, reflecting high margin production growth and strong Downstream performance. Excluding working capital, cash flow from operations was $5.3 billion. At quarter-end, debt balances stood at approximately $43 billion, more than $3 billion lower than where we began the year. Our debt ratio is currently 22.7%. During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week we announced a dividend of $1.08 per share payable to stockholders of record as of August 2017. We currently yield 4.1%. Turning to slide four. Year-to-date, net cash generation after dividends was $1 billion including $200 million generated in the second quarter. This result is a solid down payment on our full year objective of being cash balanced at $50 Brent including asset sales. Cash flow from operations was $5 billion in the quarter, up $2.5 billion from the second quarter of 2016. Year-to-date, cash from operations has totaled $8.9 billion despite working capital consumption and adverse deferred tax impacts, each sized at approximately $1.2 billion, as well as affiliate earnings exceeding dividends by $1.4 billion. Cash capital spend for the quarter was $3.2 billion, approximately $1.3 billion less than the second quarter of 2016. We continued to reduce our spend by finishing our major capital projects under construction and driving capital efficiency gains throughout our investment queue. Second quarter asset sale proceeds were approximately $430 million primarily from the sale of proxies in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado and some on the Gulf of Mexico shelf. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect our cash outcomes to favorably reflect growing production and additional proceeds from asset sales. Despite some anticipated unevenness between third quarter and fourth quarter, for example related to the precise timing of sales transactions, pension contributions and affiliate dividends, we do fully expect to end the year in a cash balance position at current prices. Slide five compares current-quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2017 results were $2.9 billion higher than second quarter 2016. Special items, primarily the absence of $2.4 billion in second quarter's 2016 net charges, partially offset by current period net charges of $270 million improved earnings by $2.1 billion between periods. An unfavorable movement in foreign exchange negatively impacted the earnings comparison by $276 million between periods. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased nearly $950 million between periods. Increased volumes and higher realization as well as lower operating expenses were partially offset by increased DD&A associated with increased production. Downstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased nearly $380 million primarily driven by higher margins and a swing in timing effects. The variance in the Other segment was primarily due to unfavorable corporate tax items. As we've indicated previously, quarterly results in the Other segment are likely to be non-ratable and we continued to guide to $1.6 billion in annual net charges for this segment. I'll now pass it over to Jay.\nJames William Johnson: Thank you, Pat. Slide six compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter 2017 production was 2.78 million barrels a day, an increase of 252,000 barrels a day or 10% over the second quarter of 2016. Major capital projects increased production by 265,000 barrels per day as we started and ramped up multiple projects including Gorgon, Angola LNG, Jack/St. Malo, Alder, Moho Nord, Mafumeira Sul and Bangka. Shale and tight production increased by 41,000 barrels a day primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian. The increases were partially offset by normal field declines and PFE effects. The other bar includes the loss of 38,000 barrels a day due to 2016 asset sales. Turning to slide seven. Year-to-date 2017 production is 2.73 million barrels a day. Up 5% from 2016 and within our guidance range of 4% to 9% growth excluding asset sales. Our expectation is that full year production will be well within our original guidance range. The ramp-up of production in the second quarter was strong, with June's monthly production at 2.85 million barrels per day. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect to see reliable production from the assets that are currently onstream, further growth in the Permian and Wheatstone coming online. Some of these increases will be offset in the third quarter due to normal turnaround activity. Year-to-date there's been no impact on production from 2017 asset sales since the first transactions involving producing assets closed on June 30. Assets sold year-to-date and assets expected to be sold later this year have a combined daily production of around 175,000 barrels per day. The impact on full year 2017 production from asset sales is expected to be 25,000 to 75,000 barrels a day given the late in year timing for the sales. Turning to slide eight. We're seeing strong performance at Gorgon. All three trains have achieved or exceeded nameplate capacity and are operating smoothly. On a 100% basis, second quarter Gorgon production was 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is currently averaging around 430,000 barrels a day. We are currently producing around 3 billion cubic feet of gas a day from 14 wells. In the second quarter, domestic gas sales were approximately 125 million cubic feet per day and condensate production was around 14,000 barrels a day. We shipped 88 LNG cargoes so far this year. Looking forward, we're focused on achieving sustained operations and are analyzing plant performance to find opportunities to increase reliability and production. Additional fine tuning of the plant will maximize efficiency and we expect further debottlenecking opportunities to increase plant capacity. Turning to slide nine. We're on track at Wheatstone. The Wheatstone platform and pipeline are operational and supplying natural gas to the inlet of the onshore LNG plant. Early well performance is encouraging. We're in the process of starting up the plant and expect to commence cool-down shortly. LNG production is expected to follow next month. Train 2 construction is progressing well and we're on track to start up six to eight months after Train 1. Turning to slide 10. The future growth project, or FGP, is progressing well, and I'll highlight some milestones. Module fabrication is in progress in Korea and Kazakhstan, as is the fabrication of gas turbine generators in Italy. Dredging is essentially complete, and other activities required for the initiation of port operations are on track. Infrastructure work and site construction are progressing, and we're 75% complete with our piloting program. We have two drilling rigs in operation on multi-well pads, with a third rig expected in August. We're on track for first production in 2022. In addition to FGP, we're also making progress on a number of other major capital projects. At Hebron, offshore Canada, the platform's been installed on location and we expect first oil before year-end 2017. Projects expected to come online in 2018 include Clair Ridge in the North Sea, where offshore hookup and commissioning is well underway; the Stampede platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which was recently installed on location; the Big Foot platform, which is preparing for sail away around the end of this year; and Tahiti, where we're progressing the Vertical Expansion project. These projects are expected to add approximately 20,000 net barrels of new production in 2018 and 65,000 net barrels in 2019. Let's turn to slide 11. This is an updated map of the Permian Basin including Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our two million acres, 1.5 million of which are Midland and Delaware Basins, are depicted in blue. Outlined on the map are our Chevron-operated and non-operated development areas. Additionally, on the right side of the chart, we've included an updated version of our assessment of acreage valuation. Currently, we estimate that approximately 650,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 an acre, and an additional 450,000 acres have a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre. The balance of our acreage is a mix. Some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation. Some lacks nearby infrastructure, and other requires further appraisal. As a reminder, these estimates are a snapshot that assumes simultaneous development at a $50 WTI price, burdened with all the development and production costs as we see them today. Let's turn to slide 12. This slide illustrates our returns-focused Permian development strategy. We're investing for value. We're applying technology and learning from others to drive capital efficiency. Let me provide a few examples of how we're using technology as a competitive advantage. We're using seismic data to detect variations in the properties of reservoirs to identify the optimal areas. We're then applying petrophysical modeling to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of rocks and their contained fluids, and we integrate geophysical information with production data to identify the most productive intervals, and to select well locations that offer the highest returns. We perform focused data analytic studies to optimize horizontal well placement and well spacing decisions. To do this, we have a comprehensive database of industry wells with production, completion, reservoir, and operational data. We also use this data to optimize our completions for proppant loading, cluster spacing, and liquid loading. During drilling operations, we use well and model data to make precise wellbore placement decisions to keep the well path within the most productive depth, often within a 10-foot interval. Our Integrated Operations Center provides support to our field personnel, who have access to real-time, operational data on mobile devices. As an example, real-time equipment information, such as excessive compressive vibration, can provide an early indication of a potential problem, allowing us to react before downtime occurs. But the real key in all this is effectively applying the technology to deliver better outcomes. We also learn by watching others. The graphs on the right side are one example of how we successfully combine our application of technology with our learning from others. The initial six months' recoveries per lateral foot are highlighted on the charts for wells in two different benches. In red are the actual results of Competitor A, who's a strong growth player in the basin, employing a strategy of speed to the development of the second Bone Spring and Avalon horizons in the Delaware Basin. They got there first, they drilled aggressively in each horizon, and they demonstrated production growth. However, their strategy of trial and error required them to spend significant capital. We've learned from their experience. The blue on the chart shows our actual results in the same horizons. For a similar number of wells, we're recovering more production per foot, and our cost per foot is lower than our competitor. Our strategy is working. We believe real value is created through capital efficiency and discipline, as well as strong, consistent execution. Let's go to slide 13. This chart illustrates three elements of financial performance. Our current financial metrics, the competitiveness of our current spend, and the attractiveness of returns for future investments. First, our unconventional Permian business, fully loaded with overhead cost, has positive after-tax earnings for the first half of 2017. We forecast earnings growth, even at flat prices in future periods, as a result of lower unit operating costs and depreciation rates. Our depreciation rates are expected to further decline as we cycle through prior invested capital and replace it with today's more efficient development costs. At actual 2017 oil, gas, and NGL prices, our year-to-date operating cash flow per barrel is approximately $20 and is accretive to Chevron's overall portfolio. Second, our unit development and operating costs are competitive and declining. The chart on the right compares our company operated with our non-operated JV costs. As you can see, cost reduction progress has been encouraging, and we are increasingly competitive. And third, the Permian is an attractive place to make future investments. We estimate, as noted in the box at the bottom, that our 2017 investments in the Permian, fully loaded with overhead, will generate greater than 30% returns at a $50 a barrel WTI price. Turning to slide 14. We're actively managing our Permian portfolio through acreage swaps, joint ventures, farm-outs and sales. This chart shows our historical and forecasted transaction activity in the Midland and Delaware Basins. We've identified between 150,000 and 200,000 acres in the Midland and Delaware Basins that we plan to transact to generate more immediate value. A recent transaction effectively more than tripled the value of our acreage simply by enabling longer laterals. Generally, the highest value transactions are swaps to core up acreage and enhance value through long laterals and other infrastructure efficiencies. In 2017, we've already closed seven deals and have grouped the remaining acreage into a number of packages that are actively being marketed. Slide 15. Production continues to track ahead of expectations as we continue to see efficiency gains and improved well performance. The chart on the left shows our second quarter, 2017 production of approximately 178,000 barrels a day, up about 44,000 barrels a day from the second quarter of 2016. In March, we gave you our forecasted Permian compounded annual growth rate of 20% to 35%. And we're currently near the top of that range. Today, we're operating 13 rigs and our plan is to continue to add rigs approximately every eight to ten weeks achieving 20 operated rigs by the end of 2018. In addition to our operated fleet, we expect to see our share of production from non-operated rigs. Our objective in the Permian is to generate value through capital and execution efficiency. We intend to be fully competitive on our unit development and production costs and realizations and use our superior royalty position to generate leading financial performance. With that, I'll turn it back over to Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. Turning now to slide 16. We continue to see lower capital spending as well as lower operating expense outlays despite significant production increases. C&E outlays have averaged $4.5 billion per quarter this year. That's over $1 billion lower than the average quarter in 2016 and over 50% lower than the average quarter in 2014. 2017 year-to-date total C&E is $8.9 billion. We are trending below our full year guidance and conservatively would expect full year C&E to come in around $19 billion. A positive pattern is also evidenced with operating expenses. The average quarter this year is $5.6 billion, $650 million lower than the average quarter in 2016 and 25% lower than the average quarter back in 2014. We expect to close out 2017 with operating expenses $1.5 billion to $2 billion lower than 2016. Second half costs will reflect growing production, the impact of asset sales and continued cost containment efforts throughout the enterprise. Now on slide 17, we're on target with our asset sales program. In fact, we're already in the $5 billion to $10 billion proceeds range that we established for the 2016 and 2017 years. With six of the eight quarters behind us, cumulative asset sale proceeds now total $5.3 billion; $2.5 billion so far this year and $2.8 billion last year. During the remainder of 2017, we have a number of transactions that are listed on the slide, where sales and purchase agreements are signed. We currently anticipate having at least $1 billion closing in the third quarter. Many of the remaining transactions are international in nature. These are often complex and subject to multiple regulatory agency oversight making timing uncertain. When all is said and done, we expect 2016 to 2017 sales proceeds to be solidly within the established guidance range. Now turning to slide 18. I'd like to close out my comments this morning on cash flow. We have an improvement trend underway with the first half of the year net cash positive after dividends by $1 billion. Production is up, in particular, high cash margin production is up and capital spend is down. We're getting more efficient and our cost structure is coming down. We're executing well on our asset sales and we're realizing good value in those transactions. We're also focused on improving returns. We expect this to happen as projects are completed and revenue is realized from growing production volumes. It'll happen as we pivot to shorter cycle time, high return investments. We showed you the opportunity we have in the Permian for high return investments. And returns will be aided by ongoing reductions in operating expenses and improvements in how we manage our capital projects. We're competitively positioned with a very strong portfolio. We're confident we're taking all the steps within our control to enhance our competitiveness longer term. So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue and so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary, and we'll certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, please open up the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Hi. Good morning, Pat and Jay.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: (24:09)\nPhilip M. Gresh: First question \u2013 morning. First question is Pat, you made some commentary in the very beginning here about the transitory factors adding up to about $3.8 billion of headwinds in the first half of the year. And if you go back to the Analyst Day, I think the number you gave for the full year at that time was $4 billion of headwinds that you were expecting. So it seems pretty front half, 1H loaded in terms of how that's played out. But just wondering if that's still a good number to be thinking about for the full year.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so good question. And I would say within our ability to forecast these things I think that is still very reasonable guidance that we gave you back in the SAM, certainly within that range.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Got it. Okay. And the second question is just around the capital spending reduction. You noted $19 billion but conservatively so. As I think about that number, and what's imbedded in there for Gorgon and Wheatstone and CPChem, et cetera, it seems like it's $2 billion if not $3 billion of spend for some projects that'll be rolling off. So as I look ahead to 2018 and beyond, you had that $17 billion to $22 billion range that you had given. And so if we take the roll-off against the conservative $19 billion, it would seem like you're tracking pretty well in a $50 Brent world to be at or even maybe below that range longer term. But I'm sure there's some offset. So maybe you could just talk about how you see the puts and takes around that, and especially in light of your peer today saying they're seeing some upward inflationary pressure.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. I think the guidance that we've given so far, we stand by. I did say $19 billion conservatively. We do anticipate additional activity in the Permian in the second half of the year. We mentioned about having the rig rates running up and so additional activity there. We do anticipate seeing more spending out of TCO as that FGP project ramps up and we also have additional spending in the Agbami infill drilling program. So there are some elements that we can see adding to outlays in the second half of the year. You're absolutely right. There will be offsets with Gorgon and Wheatstone trailing off certainly. And as I look forward to 2018, I do think that we have \u2013 we did say $17 billion to $22 billion, but we would be at the low end of that range if prices are hovering around $50. And I think that is still the best guidance that we can offer at this point. We as we normally do, we're in the middle of putting our business plans together and as we move through the second half of the year here, we will get much greater confirmation of that capital program really looks like.\nUnknown Speaker: Thanks, Phil.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your question, please.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nJames William Johnson: Hey, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: Jay, I'm going to take advantage of you being on the call. Clearly the Permian is running well ahead of your guidance. I wonder if you could speak to \u2013 I guess there's a number of facets to this. What's driving the beat? How did it impact your guidance? And from a broader portfolio standpoint, you've clearly got an enormous footprint that could really stand on itself in terms of sustaining your or offsetting your decline rate. So how does the (27:33) even think about capital allocation? Think about getting pregnant with a six-year, large scale development versus the flexibility this gives you in the broader portfolio. So strategically what role does this play going forward and what happens to the guidance?\nJames William Johnson: So you're correct. We're seeing very good performance out of the Permian. Our drive on capital efficiency and good execution is really paying off for us. We also have seen good performance from our new basis of design. It's early yet but the results are encouraging. As we look at our overall portfolio and as we finish the period of heavy capital spend that we've been on, we have a pretty youthful portfolio that allows us a lot of opportunity to continue to build now on the infrastructure that's been installed and to capitalize on the Permian as a very large resource base for us. Our current plan that we've given you has the rigs running up to 20 company operated rigs by the end of next year. One thing I really like about the Permian is we're monitoring financial performance and financial returns virtually on a real-time basis. And as we continue to see performance out of Permian, we have the option to continue to expand that rig fleet or to hold the rig fleet depending on the performance that we're seeing. So we have seen a continued set of surprises to the upward over the years as we've shown you what the Permian can do for us and I would expect to see continued performance as we move forward. What's first and foremost, out of all this is that the Permian is one of our primary assets and it will attract the capital that's necessary. We are not holding back capital to the Permian and I don't think we'll need to. As these big capital programs roll off, the amount of discretionary capital allocation that we have has been increasing pretty significantly and that's going to continue over the next several years. So I'm very encouraged.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks for the answer, Jay. My follow-up is for Pat. And, Pat, obviously the slide on Permian asset sales, just to be clear, I'm not entirely sure if you were indicating that those would be outright disposals or swaps because even at the low end of your valuation, the $20,000 an acre, that could be a $3.5 billion type number. Maybe you could just clarify that, and just a broad update on, is the $10 billion still a good number? And maybe just as a quick add-on, CapEx, combined, if we put the two together, it looks like free cash flow could be hitting a fairly substantial inflection point. Is your CapEx going to end coming in light as well? I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. So just a point of clarification, on the Permian slide where we talked about opportunities for transaction, that is a combination of swaps, leasing and sale. And as another point of clarification, that activity was not anticipated in our $5 billion to $10 billion asset sale proceeds guidance range that we had given. So that would be on top of that. And we haven't really made a distinction. We haven't clarified publicly what the proportionality of swaps versus leases, versus sales is. As we said, the priority really is on the swaps because that's where really you can capture the greatest value by being able to extend the laterals. And we also said there's a number of sales packages that are also out in the marketplace. I do think we are \u2013 this is a \u2013 2017 is a transition year. And I think we are very much at a point of inflection as we get through this year in terms of higher cash generation from the assets that are online, higher margin-accretive production, lower operating expenses as well as lower C&E outlays and greater flexibility around the capital program altogether. So I think it is very much a transition year and an inflection year.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. So just to be clear, Pat. Does the CapEx ramp up in the second half or are you trending well \u2013 you're obviously trending well under your guidance.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. We're just saying we didn't think it was appropriate for people to take the first half of the year and double it and think that that's where we were going to close out the year because we do have certain elements where we see some outlays increasing.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nEvan Calio: Hey, good morning, everybody and great results.\nJames William Johnson: Hey.\nEvan Calio: A few questions for Jay if I can. There's a significant high-grading in the Permian inventory in one quarter where you've added additional 50,000 acres at the $50 value \u2013 $50 per acre \u2013 $50,000 per acre and 100,000 at the $20,000 to $50,000 range. Can you discuss what drove the change? Was that one factor or multiple? And is that inventory review process a quarterly ongoing process? Just trying to understand or get an understanding of the progression or potential future rate of change here.\nJames William Johnson: Thank you, Evan. The actual update isn't a quarterly update. I think the last time we gave you that data was third quarter of last year. So it's over a period of time. But there are a number of factors that drive that increased valuation. Probably first and foremost is just the increasing efficiency we're continuing to see, both in terms of our recoveries and our cost development and operating cost per foot. So those are driving, to a large extent, the increased valuations that we're seeing, because they're based on our well performance. So, we would expect to see \u2013 we'll continue to update these periodically. We won't do it probably quarterly, because it's just too much effort focused on keeping track of all the acreage, but the general message is, our acreage position, we continue to work it hard. We continue to look for the next best development areas. We're using technology and the experience of others, and we are seeing continued improvement in those valuations. And then we're delivering those results.\nEvan Calio: Great. And my second question is on \u2013 you had great progressions on both DD&A and LOE in the newer slide indicate DD&A dropping 30% by 2020. I mean is that for incremental wells in 2020, or the entire Permian unconventional business by 2020? And on the LOE side, any color there on what's driving the difference? Whether that's be efficient infrastructure buildout or a shift to multi-well pad development?\nJames William Johnson: It's a combination of things. On the capital side, the DD&A is really a mix of what we've already got in the portfolio, plus the new wells being added on a continuing basis. But because of the profile of production on these wells, we have a pretty rapid turnover of the capital employed through the depreciation schedule. And so, as we move forward in time, the wells that we're drilling today are more efficient than the wells we drilled last year and the year before, and we're just seeing this progression and decrease of DD&A consistent with the decrease in our unit development costs. From a lease-operating standpoint, we have looked at our actual organization structures. We looked at how we're organized. We look at the efficiency of our factory model. We're using the Integrated Operation Center to keep our production reliability as high as possible. And, as we build scale, we don't have to increase the organization in direct proportion to the scale, so we start getting more and more economies of scale in our operations. So all those together, with the advances in the technology that we're really applying on a very real-time basis, we see this drive to continue to become more efficient.\nUnknown Speaker: Thank you, Evan.\nEvan Calio: Maybe just a follow-up to that, on the multi-well pad development, just where are you today versus where you'll be in 2020, maybe in terms of percentage of activity? Is there a big change or improvement there?\nJames William Johnson: Virtually all of our development activity now, all 13 rigs, are running in multi-well pad mode and factory mode. The only wells you'll see in the future in the Permian that won't be that basis might be some expiration wells that we do to stay ahead of our development drilling. But that would be a very small percentage of the wells.\nEvan Calio: Okay. Thank you. Impressive.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question, please.\nPaul Cheng: Good morning, guys.\nJames William Johnson: Morning.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Morning.\nPaul Cheng: Jay, just, this may be a little bit theoretical, but let's assume that by year 2020, you are running at 20 rigs and that by then, that you probably already reach at the 450,000 barrel per day or so. At that point, what kind of oil price and gas price you need in order for that to be as a self-sustained cash flow breakeven? Any kind of rough number? And also then, as you're looking at Permian, clearly the resource is impressive, but I got to believe that still have a sweet spot in terms of the resource and the peak production ratio. Any kind of help you can give us, that \u2013 I know that your result will ultimately be multiple over time of the $9.3 billion (37:22) that you are citing. But if we're looking at a result at a certain level, what will be a reasonable RP ratio to achieve the optimum capital efficiency from you guys' standpoint in the Permian?\nJames William Johnson: Okay, so from the Permian in terms of breakeven position, we gave you guidance in the SAM meeting back in March that if we \u2013 we're growing our rig fleet to 20 rigs, is our intention by the end of 2018, and then we have options at that point. But if we should decide to hold at 20 rigs and just continue to run those 20 rigs, under the current conditions with the current performance, we would expect to be cash-flow positive overall. But what's really important here is, we're looking at the returns each and every well and development area give us as we're drilling those areas and as we make the decision on the next area, and those are all very positive. How much we choose to invest into the Permian on an ongoing basis, or on an expansion basis, is really part of our portfolio allocation of, where do we get the best returns. So we're not really worried about whether the Permian in and of itself is returning positive net cash flow, as long as the underlying wells in development are all strongly positive on their financial performance. So, our view is that we're going to get to 20 rigs. We're going to understand our performance and the conditions in the Permian, and we have the option to continue to increase rigs beyond that point should we choose, and should that be an optimal place for us to continue to invest. Terms of the sweet spot, it's really \u2013 we're working on the best spots today. But what's important is, as we continue to drive more efficiencies into the business, as we continue to advance the technologies that I talked about and the application of those, what we're finding is that we're continuing to drive down our unit development cost such that we can move into areas that might not have been so attractive before are becoming more and more attractive today. And also, as the infrastructure buildout continues, we are able then to bring in some of these lower value areas now become more and more attractive, because they don't have to underpin infrastructure. We can just use what's already been built out in the past. So overall, we see a very good resource picture. We'll use exploration to stay ahead of the game, and that's really our focus.\nPaul Cheng: So you guys not really looking at, say, an RP pressure ratio, say, 30 or 40 or 25 will be the optimum. So that's not a consideration. Or that's at least not the way how you look at \u2013 how much is the overall typical program that you may end up to be.\nJames William Johnson: No. We're really looking at the financial performance of the developments that are in front of us and the results that we're achieving out of the investments we've made and comparing that with the opportunities that we have across our portfolio.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nUnknown Speaker: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nJason Gammel: Yes. Thanks very much and hi, everyone. Wanted to ask couple of questions about Gorgon if I could please. First of all, you're currently running essentially at or above nameplate capacity, but you did mention specific items like building reliability and fine tuning the process on the slide. Just wondering if this running at nameplate capacity is something that we can look forward to for the rest of the year or if you will still have some shake-out maintenance as we look towards year-end.\nJames William Johnson: Thank you. Gorgon's running really well. And particularly as we saw Train 2 and then Train 3 start up, Train 3 start-up was a beautiful thing. We're really pleased with it; it looked great. And so now all three trains are stable at or above nameplate. And that was our goal. When we look at the reliability, it's how many trips or how many times does the plant go offline, and obviously we want to eliminate those so that the plants run reliably day in and day out. And then on top of that, we start getting the plant performance data so we can look at what are the bottlenecks that we can correct that'll allow us to then increase the ultimate capacity of the plant. There may be some short pit stops that we'll take from time to time that are going to be economically driven and planned, if we find that some of those opportunities require us to take the plan offline to make that adjustment. There are other things that we'll continue to make adjustments while they're online and running. So on balance, I expect to see us running at these levels throughout the year. There may be times we'll take short pit stops but those would be planned in advance and they'll be driven by economics.\nJason Gammel: Great. And then if I could just do a follow-up on Wheatstone actually. Sounds like start-up is pretty imminent so I assume there's really nothing on a critical path for Train 1 and that you're just in commissioning process. Just wondering if there's anything still on the critical path for Train 2 to achieve that six- to eight-month start-up or if it's very similar to Train 1 where you just really are now into more of a commissioning phase.\nJames William Johnson: So on Wheatstone Train 1, you're correct, we are in the final stages of commissioning, and in fact, we are now into the true start-up phase. So we expect to see cool-down occurring here shortly. There's really no construction going on at all in Train 1 and commissioning is largely complete. In Train 2, we still are in bulk construction mode. But we expect to see that winding down in the fourth quarter and at this point in time, really don't see any particular on obstacles or challenges in our path to getting Train 2 complete and getting into the commissioning and start-up. There's always the issues of moving from bulk construction into the sequence of commissioning but we've got teams all over that. And just as we saw at Gorgon as we move from Trains 1, 2 and 3, we expect to see continuing efficiency both in the final construction and in that transition to commissioning building on the experience of the first train.\nUnknown Speaker: Thanks Jason.\nJason Gammel: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team.\nJames William Johnson: Hi, Neil.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Morning.\nNeil Mehta: First question I had was just around base decline rates. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your portfolio on a base decline rate basis and then also any thoughts in terms of how you see that evolving going forward?\nJames William Johnson: Sure. Base declines have actually been quite good. The shift in strategy as we've moved from the heavy new greenfield investments into a focus on leveraging maximum value from our installed infrastructure base on install base business has been paying big dividends. So the infield drilling programs, the focus on reliability, the workover programs have been really sustaining our production, I think better than we would have expected given the amount of capital and costs that we've pulled out of the system. We have the advantage of a portfolio that has a lot of young assets. So as we start installing things like \u2013 or start taking advantage of things like Jack/St. Malo and the other projects that I mentioned that are coming online this year and next year as well as Gorgon and Wheatstone, we are seeing a very young portfolio. Lots of continued opportunities for infield drilling and, really, brownfield expansions. And there's a lot of value in that, even at today's prices.\nNeil Mehta: I appreciate the comments, Jay. And the follow-up is just on some of the areas of disrupted production or areas where there's been a lot of focus on geopolitical issues. And just wanted your comments on three areas in particular, recognizing there could be some limitations in terms of the comments here. One would be Partitioned Zone, two would be Venezuela, and three would be Nigeria. Any updates from Chevron's perspective would be helpful.\nJames William Johnson: Sure. In the Partitioned Zone, the stopping of production continues. There's been no restart activity. There are continuing negotiations and dialogue between the two governments. We continue to advocate for a return to the status quo, get the field back in production while the longer-term issues are addressed. But at this point in time, there has not been any movement towards a restart. Somewhat perplexing to us, but we'll continue to play the role of facilitator and see if we can't get the fields restarted. I think it's in everyone's best interest. In terms of Venezuela, we have continued to be operational. We do not have major impacts on our operations at this point in time, and it's just a situation we continue to monitor. Our priority is on just maintaining safe operations, and protecting our people and assets. And in Nigeria, we continue to see good performance coming out of Nigeria. There are disruptions from time to time, but it has not had, I would consider, a material adverse effect.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Jay. Congrats on the good quarter.\nJames William Johnson: (46:54).\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Scotia Howard Weil. Your question, please.\nBlake Fernandez: Folks, good morning. I had two questions. One for Pat and one for Jay, please. Pat, on the CapEx, obviously, it looks like you're lowering the guidance from 19.8 billion down to $19 billion. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how you see that impacting the cash flow breakeven that you've articulated around $50 a barrel. Presumably, there's some downward pressure there, but any color on that?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, I mean, I think that would be a normal outcome, an intuitive sort of outcome. Obviously, if we have a little bit less spending, that's where you would fall out. I mean, I think the larger flywheel for us here may be exactly the timing of asset sales during the second half of the year. As I mentioned, many of those are international transactions and getting a bead on exactly when they will close, whether they will close in fourth quarter or perhaps move into first quarter, there's still some uncertainty around those.\nBlake Fernandez: Okay. Second question on the Permian, Jay. Based on the feedback we're hearing from some of the refiners, it sounds like we're getting relatively close to exhausting the light sweet processing capacity along the Gulf Coast, and we're starting to see some batching, which kind of indicates we're preparing for some oil exports. I didn't know how that would impact your growth rates and is there an opportunity? Are you planning to participate in exports? Or is that really something you're just going let the midstream players kind of handle on their own? Thanks.\nJames William Johnson: Well, look, when we've talked before about how we look at the Permian, we look at the whole value chain. So everything from our development, operating cost on the front end to the realizations we get on the back end. And we've done a lot of good work to open up multiple pathways to get our products to market so that we can take advantage of the different variations in the markets. So we have been working to stay ahead of our build out curve. At this point, we don't see any constrictions on our ability to grow, as we've discussed, in the Permian. And this is an area that we'll continue to stay focused on and seek the best realizations as we move forward. Thank you.\nUnknown Speaker: Thanks, Blake.\nBlake Fernandez: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question, please?\nDoug Terreson: Hi, everybody.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Hi.\nJames William Johnson: Hello.\nUnknown Speaker: Hey, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: Jay, I had just a clarification question for you. A few minutes ago you talked about 30% returns in the Permian. And when you say 30% returns, are you talking about fully-burdened returns? Or conventional return on capital type definition? Or drilling decision returns? Or what are we talking about there?\nJames William Johnson: No, when we're talking about 30% returns, we're basing that on a $50 WTI price, $2.50 (49:45) gas, $25 NGLs. And what we are doing is looking at our all-in costs, so we're not cherry picking just development costs or anything like that. But this is what we really expect to see, full returns, fully burdened.\nDoug Terreson: Okay. So, Jay, it includes facilities and land costs and all the other things that some people leave out. Is that correct?\nJames William Johnson: Yes.\nDoug Terreson: Okay. Just wanted to be sure. And then also had a question for Pat. Pat, the performance in your Downstream business has improved significantly. Your returns are not only above the cost of capital, but they're as close to that of some of your peers as they've been in a decade or so from what I can tell. I mean, they've gotten to be really good. So when you consider this increase in absolute and relative value of that business, I wanted to see if we could get your updated perspective how you think about that business, meaning besides my point about rising relative and absolute value, what are some of the other factors that you consider when you think about whether or not the R&M and chemicals business should be a core part of the portfolio, longer term?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Well, we do completely believe the R&M should be a core part of our portfolio long-term. We like our integrated model, not only for the hedge that it makes in terms offsetting commodity price impacts on the Upstream side, but we use it, importantly, in terms of kind of knowledge transfer between Downstream and Upstream for the efficient operations of plants and facilities. So it's a core part of our business. I think we have been very successful over the last decade really.\nJames William Johnson: Yeah.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: In improving the returns on Downstream, through some of the transactions and the fine tuning of the portfolio, optimizing of the portfolio that we've done. Plus significant effort around cost management and cost containment. It's a growth opportunity for us if you're including the chemical sector in here as well. So I think it's a key part of our portfolio going forward and we would look to expand and evaluate its investment opportunities for future growth projects. Just along the way we would look at other opportunities. It would compete for capital for future investments as well, in the chemical sector in particular.\nDoug Terreson: Okay. No it's been real successful.\nUnknown Speaker: Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: Just real success story for you guys. Thanks a lot.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Absolutely.\nDoug Terreson: Yep.\nJames William Johnson: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Your question please?\nAnish Kapadia: Hi. First question was going back to your Permian position. So you talked about the \u2013 gave a bit more detail about the asset of swaps and sales going forward. But I think one the big stores of value that you have that you could potentially bring forward is the value of your royalty position. If you look at where some of the pure play lifted royalty names are trading in North America. So I'm just wondering, have you thought about maybe selling or monetizing some of your royalty positions in the current, very low interest rate environment?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, Anish, so obviously, this is a topical area there. We're certainly very much aware of the opportunity, and we have evaluated it. But I think the best I can say at this point is, we don't have any plans for anything like this at this point in time.\nAnish Kapadia: Okay. Thank you. And then I had a follow-up. We used to (53:26) get a little bit of an update on your North American activity onshore outside of the Permian. And just thinking about your updated plans in terms of the Duvernay in California, what's the outlook there? And also the Marcellus and, combined with that, is there any thoughts of maybe hedging in the gas price to lock in returns, to be able to put rigs back to work?\nJames William Johnson: So as we look at the different assets that we have across North America, one of the things that we are very active on is sharing the information and best practices that are being developed in each area with the other unconventional areas. So we've seen cost, development cost, come down in the Duvernay. We've been largely involved in an appraisal program and a land tenure strategy. But now, with the results that we're seeing, we have a good-sized resource there and we are evaluating, as Pat mentioned earlier, our business plan at the current time on just what we want to do there, but it's very encouraging. We'll give you more details on each of those in the SAM meeting next year. In terms of the Marcellus, we've also seen our cost structure come down significantly, as well as our drilling efficiency improve. So that also has some promise, especially with the recovery in gas price, as to whether or not we hedge. That's something that we'll evaluate as part of putting together our strategy going forward. Another key area for us is the San Joaquin Valley, where we continue to run a very efficient operation in that area. The strategy there has been a drill-to-fill strategy, so we're really utilizing the existing installed infrastructure base, and we see very good returns coming out of our San Joaquin area. Builds on our heavy oil expertise, and provides a very good return us to. So North America overall looks very strong in the onshore areas. Thank you.\nUnknown Speaker: Thanks, Anish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please?\nRyan Todd: Hey, everybody. Maybe a quick follow-up on the Delaware Basin. One of your competitors today talked about drilling laterals up to 15,000 to 20,000 feet in the Delaware. Can you talk about your general thoughts on lateral length, where you're trending right now in terms of where you've been pushing lateral length? And what you think about the ultimate extent of those efforts going forward?\nJames William Johnson: Yeah. Thanks very much. It's a good question. And there are a lot of different things being tried in the Permian on a real-time basis. And, as I mentioned earlier, our strategy, we've been criticized for it maybe a little bit in the past, but it's proving to be a very good strategy, is to let some of the others do some of the experimentation and then we watch and see what performs well, and then build that into our basis of design. Right now, our focus is on 7500 to 10,000-foot laterals. We'll wait and see if those really turn out. But as you get longer and longer laterals, it gets very difficult to get good returns throughout the length of the well bore. So, our focus is on getting the ultimate return for the capital invested. And that's really what's going to drive us more than any other single parameter.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. That's helpful. And then, maybe a follow-up on some of the earlier comments and questions on free cash flow. It does look like there's \u2013 we're already seeing some amount of free cash flow, probably a greater inflection as we look into 2018. You've paid down a decent amount of debt this year. How should we think about your prioritizations for use of free cash as we go forward in terms of incremental capital, debt paydown, resumption of a share buyback, et cetera?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. I mean, Ryan, I'm going to go back and just reiterate our priorities that we've had. Dividend increase would be the first one, as soon as we can see our way clear to having a sustainable increase, meaning supported by cash flow and earnings. After that, it becomes the capital program, and where do we have incremental opportunity for investments there. You've heard about how strong an opportunity queue we've got sitting there in the Permian. We do want to keep a strong balance sheet. I think that's important, and it's particularly important being in the commodity cycle. And we've learned in the past that, when oil prices are high, it's good to shore up a little bit, and when oil prices are low, you use your balance sheet. And so we want to make sure that we're prepared through the thick and thin of the cycle. I do see share repurchases as the last use of cash, and I think those, at this point in time, with the view we have of commodity prices, et cetera, it's fairly remote for us.\nUnknown Speaker: Thanks, Ryan.\nRyan Todd: Good. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please?\nRoger D. Read: Yeah. Thanks, good morning.\nUnknown Speaker: Morning, Roger.\nJames William Johnson: Morning.\nRoger D. Read: Follow-up on the Permian. 20 rigs by the end of 2018 from 13 today, it seems, whether it's the Permian or other shales, comments from developers have been that you keep learning more the breakeven number of rigs to keep production flat, or to grow it at a higher rate, keeps declining, as well as breakeven prices. I was wondering, as you think about the 20 rigs, is that based on static knowledge today, or is that incorporating the idea of improving efficiencies, and that's part of how we should think about the range of 20% to 35% on the CAGR?\nJames William Johnson: Yeah. So the 20 is really based on \u2013 we want to be bringing rigs in a steady, orderly fashion so that we can continue to increase the organizational capability around those rigs and make sure we're continuing to use each incremental rig very efficiently. So if you think about all the work that has to go on from establishing the land position, coring up, getting ready for the design of the development area, all through the procurement and then into the offtake afterwards, we want to make sure that we're keeping the organization and the factory healthy around each incremental rig. What we are finding is that, in addition to increasing the rigs, the amount of production each rig is generating is higher, and growing as the efficiencies improve. So part of it is increasing the rigs, but part of it is also getting more out of each and every rig that we apply. And the fleet is becoming more productive. So we're balancing all that. And as I say, because we get data on virtually a real-time basis, we're able to make decisions now and look forward and decide, do we want to continue that pathway higher or do we want to go ahead and hold at any number of particular rigs that we feel would deliver the efficiency? Capital's not the issue. It's really making sure that we're delivering the financial performance that we're looking for.\nRoger D. Read: Okay. I appreciate it.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Hey. I think the...\nRoger D. Read: Could I ask you just one thing, Pat, real quick on the dividend? It's been modest growth the last couple years. And the earlier question about free cash flow allocation, just at what point do you think you'll have the confidence in say a flat $50 oil world to maybe move the dividend a little more aggressively?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: It's a Board call here and I think it's not just what current prices are but it's the outlook for future prices as well because it gets into a sustainable support level for the dividend that's important. So it's a combination of what's the commodity price outlook that we have, how are we seeing our capital program, how are we seeing cost structure, and as I said, we made tremendous strides over the last couple of years to get into a much more cash balanced position. And we're cognizant of our 29-year history and would love to be able to take it to a 30-year history but we're only going to do that when we have full confidence that it's a sustainable increase.\nRoger D. Read: Thanks. I'll bet on 30 though.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Okay. All right. I think we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please?\nBrendan Warn: Yeah. Thanks. I'll keep this short considering it's the last one. Just two-part question. I guess relating to Tengiz, you gave a bit of an update. Can you talk about the capital commitment to Tengiz? Obviously, it seems money buys a whole lot more today than it did 12 months ago and you're carrying quite a high contingency on that project. Can you just flag where that we should be seeing the CapEx coming for Tengiz? And then I've got a follow-up question, please.\nJames William Johnson: Look, it's early days in terms of Tengiz. We carry good contingency and we make sure that when we run our economics, we really take into account what we think it could cost, not just what we want it to cost. We're taking all the steps we talked about in previous calls in terms of making sure the design assurance, our contracting strategies, our execution and our quality management are all in place. It's got our full and complete attention. So we're really working hard to manage this project. We're off to a good start. Projects of this nature are so large, there are always going be challenges and our goal is to address those challenges and minimize the use of contingency. But it's too early to give any other guidance than what we've given so far.\nBrendan Warn: Okay. My follow-up to Pat, and I guess it's in regards to the abilities of the Permian to deliver. That $17 billion to $22 billion and more focusing on the $17 billion, that soft floor, and I guess in around $50 a barrel Brent. I mean, how should we think about that $17 billion? Where could it potentially be considering what you're getting out of your short cycle investments now?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, I think the best I can do is just say we're in the midst of our business planning cycle here and we'll come out with our C&E plan for the 2018 year around December. Typically, that's when we would do it after we've had a chance to go through the full business planning cycle. I don't have any different guidance other than to say what we've said. I mean, we are getting, for every dollar spent, Jay just went through it, for every dollar that we're spending we're getting much better response out of the Permian. So the capital efficiency per dollar is really increasing and that will all be taken into account as we're doing our revised planning. It is important for us to be cash balanced, this year with asset sales and next year without asset sales. And so those are primary objectives that we will be trying to balance as we put this next year's plan together.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Thanks very much. I'd like to thank everybody for the time on the call today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron, and we appreciate everybody's questions on the call and participation. Thank you. Jonathan, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Steve Green, President, Chevron Asia-Pacific Exploration & Production company. Also joining us on the call is Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2. I'll begin with a discussion of first quarter 2017 results. Steve will provide an update on upstream activities, with an emphasis on the portfolio he leads in the Asia-Pacific region. Then I'll conclude with a recap of key messages from our March 2017 security analyst meeting. Turning to slide 3, an overview of our financial performance, the company's first quarter earnings were $2.7 billion or $1.41 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and special items, as detailed in an appendix slide, earnings for the quarter totaled $2.3 billion or $1.23 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $3.9 billion and included about $1 billion in working capital consumption. Excluding working capital, cash flow from operations was $4.8 billion. At quarter end, debt balances stood at $45 billion, approximately $900 million lower than where we ended 2016. On a headline basis, this means a debt ratio of approximately 24%. On a net debt basis, our debt net of cash totaled $38 billion. Our debt ratio stood at approximately 20%. During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.08 per share payable to stockholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield 4%. Turning to slide 4, we intend to be cash balanced in 2017 at $50 Brent prices, and this slide demonstrates that we are nicely on our way to delivering that. First quarter 2017 net cash generation of $900 million incorporates the impacts of growing operating cash flow, reduced capital spend, and proceeds from asset sales. Operating cash flow reflects improved realizations and high-margin volume growth. Deferred tax effects were approximately $600 million, and affiliate earnings exceeded affiliate dividends by approximately $700 million. TCO did not pay a dividend during the first quarter. That is more likely a second half event. Additionally, working capital requirements consumed approximately $1 billion in the quarter. If you look back over several years, you will generally see a pattern of working capital consumption in the first quarter and often the second quarter resulting from the timing of tax and variable compensation payments as well as inventory build. The historical pattern also shows reversal in the second half of the year, and we expect that reversal pattern to hold again this year. Cash capital spend for the quarter was $3.3 billion, approximately $2.3 billion or 40% less than the first quarter of 2016. Reductions come mainly from finishing our major capital projects under construction, pacing and high-grading future investments, and realizing efficiency gains along with higher cost reductions. First quarter asset sale proceeds were $2.1 billion, primarily from the sale of our geothermal assets in Indonesia. Turning now to slide 5, here you see current quarter earnings compared against the same period last year. First quarter 2017 results were $3.4 billion higher than first quarter 2016 results. Special items, primarily a gain from the sale of our Indonesian geothermal assets, increased earnings by $795 million between periods. Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased $2.3 billion between periods. This reflected improved realizations, lower operating expenses, and increased volumes. Downstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by approximately $80 million, mostly due to the swing in timing effects and lower operating expenses. The variance in the other segment was primarily from lower employee expenses and favorable corporate tax items. As we've indicated previously, our guidance for the other segment is $1.6 billion in annual net charges, so quarterly results are likely to be non-ratable. Turning to slide 6, I'll now compare results for the first quarter of 2017 with the fourth quarter of 2016. First quarter results were approximately $2.3 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Special items, mainly from a gain on the sale of geothermal assets in Indonesia, increased earnings between periods by $600 million, while foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $267 million between periods. Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $267 million between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations. Downstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange were higher by $668 million, reflecting the absence of the impacts of the fourth quarter Richmond refinery turnaround and a swing in timing effects. The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges and a swing in corporate tax items between quarters. Turning to slide 7, this chart shows first quarter production growth of 82,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or more than 3% from full-year 2016 levels. Startups and ramp-ups, primarily from Gorgon, Angola LNG, and Alder as well as growth in our Permian assets support accelerated production through the quarter. Base declines, the impact of production sharing and variable royalty contracts, along with the 2017 impact of asset sales consummated in 2016, reduced production. Looking forward to the remainder of 2017, we expect to see additional growth from Gorgon Train 3, the first train at Wheatstone, and Sonam. Additionally, we expect to see continued ramp-ups from other MCPs such as Mafumeira Sul and Moho Nord as well as growth in our Permian assets. Ultimate production growth for 2017 will be impacted by uncertainties, such as the timing and speed of MCP startups and ramp-ups, external events such as the Partition Zone restart, and base decline rates. Price and spend levels will also impact the amount of cost recovery barrels we receive. All said, we expect to comfortably be within the 4% to 9% growth range we provided earlier in the year, again before asset sales. Our current estimate for the impact of 2017 asset sales on production continues to be a reduction of 50,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement to sell our assets in Bangladesh, which produced approximately 114,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. The annualized impact of this and other asset sales will be dependent upon the timing of this close and of other individual transactions. And now Steve will walk us through some upstream updates.\nStephen W. Green: Thanks Pat. Good morning. Turning to slide 8, all three trains at Gorgon are operational making LNG and in aggregate running over 85% of nameplate capacity, processing gas from both the Jansz and Gorgon fields. The Gorgon project is currently loading a ship about every two days and has shipped 67 cargoes to date, with 38 cargoes shipped since the beginning of the year. Cargo 68 is currently loading now. Recent highlights include we maintained domestic gas production of about 130 million cubic feet per day through the quarter. The Gorgon offshore field started up mid-February. Trains 1 and 2 operated reliably near capacity, with first quarter net LNG production of 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Train 3 started up mid-March, a month ahead of schedule, and very much like Train 2, above expectations on ramp-up and approached nameplate capacity within two weeks We recently completed a shutdown of Train 2. The shutdown was planned to address a reliability issue previously identified and resolved on Train 1 and on Train 3 prior to startup. Once all three trains are at nameplate capacity, our share of Gorgon production will be over 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Looking ahead, we'll complete commissioning and startup of additional equipment which boosts efficiency of the trains such as the turbo expanders and the end flash gas compressors, systems that can be started now that all three trains are operational. Once all systems are in operation, we can begin the optimization and tuning of each train, the first step in further increasing capacity. After this, we'll analyze plant performance and look for debottlenecking opportunities that'll increase capacity and capture incremental value going forward. Turning to slide 9, at Wheatstone, the physical construction of all systems required to commence Train 1 startup is complete, and our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. Presently, we're focused on commissioning a range of systems as we move toward first gas and have begun running and testing the compressors. We've achieved permanent power at both the onshore and offshore facilities. We're also progressing activities such as mechanical, electrical, and instrument tests as well as final integrity inspections. Within Chevron, we're leveraging our experience locally from Gorgon and more broadly from Angola LNG, which has been operating steadily since the beginning of this year. We're also working closely with our partner, Woodside, which operates several LNG projects. We're preparing for a strong startup, recognizing it is still the first train of a new facility. We anticipate Train 2 startup about 6 to 8 months after Train 1. Turning to slide 10, a primary strength of our portfolio is our base business, where we generate value and cash flow through a disciplined approach. Capturing incremental value in base business is not new to us. We've been doing it for decades. During my time in Thailand, we continuously reinvented ourselves and increased efficiency. We planned our work to avoid stranding capital by bringing wells online timed to meet contractual obligations and market opportunities. This pattern continues today. This chart provides an example from our Thailand E&P business, where we drill over 500 wells per year and have net production of 240,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We've seen a substantial reduction in unit development and operating cost through well planning and execution. We've applied these best practices across the company and are seeing benefits in places such as San Joaquin Valley, Indonesia, and the Permian. We're also leveraging our installed capacity and our technological capability to generate value. An example comes from Agbami, where we've drilled and tied back 36 wells since 2005, which have kept the FPSO full. Another example is the 27-mile Lianzi tieback to an existing host in deepwater West Africa, where technology unlocked the opportunity to produce from a remote satellite reservoir. We have an integrated operations center in many of our core assets, where we create collaborative environments for cross-functional teams to analyze asset performance data and to make better intervention decisions. These centers are low-cost and consistently generate value. At TCO, it's helped achieve and sustain record production levels, with a focus on reliability and continued optimization of the well portfolio. We also have an integrated operations center in the Permian, which we expect will help us increase reliability and drive efficiency as our activity levels and production grows. Turning to slide 11, in the Permian, we continue to meet if not exceed expectations. The chart on the left shows our first quarter 2017 production of approximately 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up about 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the first quarter 2016. In March, we gave you our forecasted Permian compound annual growth rate of 20% to 35%, and we're currently well within that range. We're standing up our 12th rig, and our plan is to continue to add rigs at this pace, achieving 20 operated rigs by the end of 2018. In addition to our operated fleet, we'll see our share of production from 13 gross non-operated rigs. We continue to see efficiency gains and improved well performance, and we're incorporating the learnings into our forward plans. We intend to realize value through accelerated development and deliberate portfolio actions from the 150,000 to 200,000 acres we have identified as candidates for swaps, leases, or sales. Our objective in the Permian is to be fully competitive on our unit development and production cost and realizations and use our superior royalty position to generate leading financial performance. With that, I'll turn it back over to Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, thanks, Steve. Now turning to slide 12, we continue to lower our cost structure and reduce our spend. The chart shows a steep reduction in quarterly average C&E since 2014. Year-to-date capital expenditures of $4.4 billion are down 22% compared to the average 2016 quarter and down 56% compared to the average 2014 quarter. We are trending below annual guidance. We previously communicated that our capital guidance range is $17 billion to $22 billion per year through 2020. If oil prices remain near the $50 per barrel mark, you can expect to see our future spend near the bottom of this range. Year-to-date operating expense is down almost 11% when compared to the average 2016 quarter and down 26% when compared to the average 2014 quarter. We have made substantial progress on lowering our cost structure, and we are striving to have the remaining quarters of 2017 broadly continue this pattern. Now on slide 13, we received approximately $2.1 billion in asset sale proceeds in the quarter, the vast majority of which related to the sale of our geothermal assets in Indonesia. Since the beginning of 2016, we've sold approximately $5 billion in assets, and thus have already achieved the lower band of our targeted two-year range. Also during the quarter, we signed sales and purchase agreements to sell our marketing and refining assets in British Columbia and Alberta as well as our downstream business in South Africa and Botswana. These in-progress transactions are subject to regulatory reviews prior to closing, hopefully later this year. Additionally, we announced an agreement to sell our upstream assets in Bangladesh, a business where gas production is sold into the domestic market at a fixed price. Turning now to slide 14, I'd like to close by reiterating our messages from our recent security analyst meeting. Our financial priorities are clear and consistent. Our number one priority is to maintain and grow the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. To do that, we're focused on three areas. First, we are taking actions that should enable us to be cash balanced in 2017. We intend to continue to grow free cash flow thereafter. The first quarter was a good start. Second, we are focused on improving returns. This will happen as projects are completed and revenue is realized from growing production volume. It will happen as we shift our capital program. 75% of our spend is expected to generate cash within two years, and it will be aided by ongoing reductions in operating expenses and improvements in how we manage our major capital projects. Third, we're focused on unlocking value from our entire portfolio. Our portfolio is anchored by legacy positions and advantaged by assets that are early in life. This gives us the opportunity to realize efficiency, reliability, and debottlenecking gains with short-cycle high-return capital investments. So that concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please go ahead and open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies, your question, please.\nJason Gammel: Thanks very much and hi, everyone. I'd like to take advantage of Steve being on the call and ask a couple questions about Australia, if I could. Steve, you referenced in your remarks that Gorgon was currently operating at about 85%. I think each of the trains individually has been able to run at its nameplate capacity. Could you talk about anything that's on the critical path for all three trains being able to operate at nameplate capacity simultaneously and essentially what needs to be done before you can reach full economic capacity at Gorgon?\nStephen W. Green: Sure, Jason. Thanks for the question. We have operated all three trains at or near capacity, and we're seeing good performance from all three trains. There's nothing that is prohibiting us from operating at nameplate capacity except the fact that we have to work through a methodical startup and again bring on the proper blend from gas from Jansz and Gorgon. In my prepared remarks, I referenced there's some additional equipment that we will now commission since all three trains are operating that will allow us to, again, boost capacity and continue working toward nameplate capacity. But all three trains have operated very reliably. They're operating reliably now. The Train 2 shutdown was a planned event to address a mechanical device that we knew we were going to. So we're looking forward now to a reliable period of operation that allows us to do some tuning and performance improvements.\nJason Gammel: Okay, very clear. And then maybe as a follow up, I did note in the media that there was an unfavorable tax ruling recently in Australia that I think was related to interest deduction on some intercompany loans for some prior-year tax returns. I think the number was about $250 million that was referenced. I just wanted to check and see if there was any further potential liability on any past tax returns related to this issue and if there's anything prospectively that you think will affect your tax position in Australia.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: So, Jason, I'm going to go ahead and take that one, and I guess I want to start with expressing our huge disappointment in the ruling. I want to make it clear to everybody though that the courts affirmed that the financing arrangements that we had in place are legal. And so the issue that is being litigated here is the appropriate interest rate for a loan between our corporate group and our Chevron Australia subsidiary. I would say that the court ruling deviates substantially from recognized international transfer pricing guidelines. And in those guidelines, the courts are to treat related parties to a transaction as if they were standalone separate legal entities. And the Australian appellate court really failed to do this, so in other words they were making no distinction between the creditworthiness of the Chevron Corporation as an entity versus Chevron Australia as an entity, and therefore no distinction on the relative borrowing costs between those entities. I'd say that there's an awful lot at stake with this ruling, not just for Chevron but for any intercompany lending in Australia and more broadly around the globe, because it fundamentally changes established transfer pricing guidelines and principles. So if the ruling stands, it certainly going to affect any future investment in Australia. And I would say going forward and thinking about it specific to the Chevron case, we're obviously evaluating the decision. Now the decision just came out a week ago. It's a fairly lengthy decision, and we're reviewing our options. Those options include going forward with an appeal to the High Court of Australia as well as continuing on with discussions with the ATO on possible settlements and any other reasonable resolution to the dispute.\nJason Gammel: Thanks, Pat, very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays, your question, please.\nPaul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning. Steve, I had two questions. First, you mentioned that the Train 2 is done. So when's that supposed to come back? And I presume that you already \u2013 what happened is the mechanical issue you already addressing in Train 3 and Wheatstone. And also for Gorgon Train 4 and also Wheatstone Train 3, what kind of precondition do you need in order that you even consider an FID at this moment?\nStephen W. Green: Sure. Thanks, Paul. With respect to Train 2, it is online and operating and producing LNG this morning. And as I mentioned, a little more color than in my prepared remarks, the issue that we addressed on the recent Train 2 shutdown was a mechanical device that's part of the flow measurement apparatus that we had previously dealt with in Train 1 and we corrected in Train 3 prior to Train 3 even starting up. Certainly, we are transferring all the learnings and experience from Gorgon to the Wheatstone project, so that prior to startup they have the opportunity to intervene and address those known issues prior to startup. As far as expansion trains at Gorgon and Wheatstone, there are a lot of factors that go into that. Our first priority is to get these assets up, stable, working as intended, and capture the value from the investment we've made. At that point then, it will be that decision, like any major capital project, will be a function of the market and the market's appetite for it and how those individual investments will compete in our portfolio at the time we FID them.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research, your question, please.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, everyone. Pat, you mentioned TCO no dividend. Could you just remind us? I think that you had said that at $50 Brent, below $50 you have to contribute to the capital expenditure programs there, above it's self-financing. I was just wondering what the sensitivity is on the dividend as regards to the oil price and whether I've got about the right numbers there. Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Actually, Paul, what happened was that in 2016, we and Exxon made co-loans into the joint venture. There was also a third-party borrowing. And a summation of that, when you looked at the amount of funds that came into the enterprise relative to the amount of investment that was going to be required on the capital project, there were sufficient funds projected out for 2017 where there would not be another co-lending requirement needed for 2017. As you look forward in 2018 and if you assume a $50-ish scenario, there will more likely than not be co-loans going on in 2018 \u2013 2019. Somewhere in the $2 billion to $3 billion-ish range is our requirement for total affiliate spending over this period of time. So what we were saying is that because there was an advance funding of capital requirements in 2016, we didn't see that we would need to co-lend again in 2017. We do anticipate that there will be a dividend receipt in the second half of this year for us.\nPaul Sankey: That would be around oil prices? Sorry.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: That's exactly right, that's exactly right. And going forward, there will be obviously a lot of planning around what is the pace of spending on the project, what's happening to oil prices, what's the internal cash generation at TCO, et cetera.\nPaul Sankey: Great, thanks, Pat. And then the follow-up is your volume target for this year of 4% to 9% growth is a pretty big range. When I look at the uncertainties that you've listed, you seem to be saying that Gorgon/Wheatstone are bang-on schedule as far as you're concerned. I'll give you the Partition Neutral Zone uncertainty. I understand that one. I would have thought the base decline was fairly predictable by the time we're in April, and I don't really understand why there would be a PSC [Production Sharing Contract] effect if you were assuming $50 oil. Is it safe to say that we should be looking towards the higher end of that range because of the uncertainties apart from the Partition Neutral Zone are essentially being significantly mitigated? Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I think what we were trying to do in addition to PZ, PZ is a significant component there, but we're also trying to say that even \u2013 what people capture in their mind is the 4% to 9%, and they forget the pricing premise that was used for it. And so yes, there are price sensitivities built into that range that influence cost recovery barrels and the like. Also, the investment levels going forward influence the cost recovery barrels as well. So we were just trying to be as descriptive as we possibly could be in naming the things that could either work to the upside or work to the downside.\nPaul Sankey: I guess my point is that it feels like the downside effects are significantly mitigated.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: If we continue on with first quarter results into second quarter and third quarter results, I would agree with you.\nPaul Sankey: Thanks, Pat.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs, your question, please.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nFrank Mount: Hi, Neil.\nNeil Mehta: Hey, how are you guys? First question relates to CapEx. It looks like you're tracking below the guidance, and I wanted to confirm, Pat. The $17 billion to $22 billion, it sounds like you're going to be on the lower end of that range at $50 a barrel Brent. And relative to the guidance, what surprised to the downside here as it relates to CapEx?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I think that we are trending lower than a ratable amount would give you relative to our $19.8 billion target for this year. The affiliate spending was a little bit lower than ratable. And I think as you go through the year, there will be spending by TCO in particular that should pick up as the remaining three quarters get underway. Other than that, I would just speak to capital efficiency. I think we are getting much more output \u2013 much greater activity for a given dollar spend than we were anticipating. So coming in at the lower end of \u2013 coming in below the $19.8 billion could very well be where we end up for the year.\nNeil Mehta: I appreciate that. And, Pat, corporate costs were a little funky this quarter, favorable after being unfavorable last quarter. Can you talk about some of the drivers that contributed to that benefit?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, it's my favorite topic. Actually, all I would say is that the corporate sector can be really quite volatile. It does include certain corporate expenses, for example, related to employees. I mentioned last quarter, if you'll recall, about pension settlement costs. That's a factor that goes on in here. But more impactful typically would be corporate consolidated tax entries, and those are just very hard for us to predict. They're not necessarily ratable, and that's really what you see going on here in this particular quarter. I would just again ask you to go back and think about the full year and use the $1.6 billion net charge for that sector for us in your predictions. That's the best information that I have, and it will be not ratable. It will be lumpy.\nNeil Mehta: That's great. Thanks, Pat.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America, your question, please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks, good morning, everybody. Good morning, Pat. Pat, disposals, you made the point that you've already hit the low end of your range. There is some speculation that there could be additional asset sales that you haven't yet put in the public domain, Canada oil sands being the case in point. I'm just wondering if you could frame what the objective is. Is it to achieve the $5 billion to $10 billion, or is it to high-grade the portfolio? And what I'm really getting at is, if there were other things to sell, would you cap the sales at $10 billion, or would you keep going as you upgrade the portfolio? And I've got a follow-up, please.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. So I don't think it's an either/or circumstance. We do want to come in between the $5 billion to $10 billion, but we also are very focused on improving the portfolio and high-grading the portfolio. So we put this target out a year and a half ago or so now, and we're in the second half of the time period in executing it. I think it's still a good target for us this year, but we will continue to look at the portfolio and continue to see if there are assets that again, either aren't strategic or not closely strategic, whether there's value that others see in it that's greater than ours or that won't attract capital in our capital allocation process.\nDoug Leggate: Can you address Canada specifically?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Canada, it's a good asset for us. It's a cash generator for us. We're obviously aware of \u2013 you're talking about oil sands. I'm talking about oil sands at least.\nDoug Leggate: Yeah, I am.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: We're aware of the transactions that have occurred in this space over the last few weeks. All I would say is that if we were to transact, we'd want to make sure we got good value for it.\nDoug Leggate: My follow-up, Pat, hopefully a quick one. At the Analyst Day, you talked about evaluating a case to add an additional 10 rigs after the 20 rigs in the end of 2018. I'm just wondering, with CapEx trending below target, I know it's really early days. I get that. But I'm just wondering where you are in that evaluation, whether the pace might accelerate faster than you're currently guiding, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Really I hate to \u2013 Doug, I hate to go off of guidance we gave just four weeks ago or so. It clearly is in our quiver here. We are obviously very much evaluating it. We're seeing great efficiency in terms of what we get per dollar spent. All of the production and operating cost improvements that we noted before continue to happen. So we very well may be able to capture much greater activity and therefore much greater volume per dollar spent. So we'll continue to look at this. We understand the \u2013 we have the same desire that our shareholders have, which is monetizing that asset as best we can, and this is certainly one avenue for doing that.\nDoug Leggate: Appreciate that, Pat. Good weekend, everyone.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Thanks.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan, your question, please.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Hey, good morning, just one additional follow-up on Gorgon, I guess Wheatstone as well. With the production that we saw in the first quarter and where you're running today and then assumed startup cost for Wheatstone, how are you thinking about the real cash flow contribution from these two assets in 2017? I know they're meant to be a big contributor in the long term. But with the startup costs for Wheatstone and Gorgon finally just hitting its full stride, how much of that long-term cash flow contribution do you actually expect this year?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I would say from a Gorgon standpoint, a reasonable number to have in your mind is a couple billion dollars. And of course, Wheatstone is just going to be ramping up, so I wouldn't expect a significant contribution there.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Would you expect it to actually be a negative with the startup?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I don't think I want to give a number there necessarily. There are still capital expenditures that are being incurred. And so if you look at it including capital expenditures, the answer on that would obviously be yes. It's probably a net drain on us.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Understood. My follow-up is just...\nPatricia E. Yarrington: For 2016 (36:35).\nPhilip M. Gresh: Yes, okay, got it. My follow-up is just on your supplement. The other production bucket for nat-gas has been up significantly. I assume that's Angola. You touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks. But maybe, Steve, if you could just highlight a little bit more for us where you're at with Angola and what you're expecting for the year.\nStephen W. Green: Well, as you know, Angola restarted early part of the year, and it's been running very reliably since that time. And we are consistently loading LNG cargoes, propane cargoes, butane, and we expect that performance to continue. We've gotten the plant where we want it now and it's operating reliably.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Phil.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley, your question, please.\nEvan Calio: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nFrank Mount: Hi, Evan.\nEvan Calio: Pat, you mentioned that CapEx runs to a low end for 2017 if oil is near $50. Oil being near $50, can you discuss when you begin to adjust that spending? And is that adjustment within short-cycle Permian or elsewhere, just how that plays out in the 2017 capital program?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I would just say within upstream, I think there is fine-tuning as the year progresses about where capital opportunities are being generated \u2013 additional spending opportunities are being generated. Obviously, the Permian is going to be one of the first places to draw additional capital, but there are other short-cycle investments, for example, in Thailand and also in San Joaquin that would also be attractive as well. So that is a routine optimization that goes on within the upstream leadership team \u2013 I won't say on a monthly basis, but obviously they continue to monitor that as the year progresses.\nEvan Calio: Right. So that works for lowering CapEx as well? I think you phrased it for raising CapEx.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I did phrase it for lowering it. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I meant...\nEvan Calio: Perfect, sure. My second question, I know, for Paul, I know a lot's been covered here within Australia. I know you have a lot of moving pieces in the portfolio that are outside of Chevron's control. Maybe just some update of conditions to outlook in Nigeria, Venezuela, and PNZ, any update in those regions I think would be helpful. Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Let me just \u2013 I'll take PZ first. I can say that negotiations and discussions are underway still. They're still occurring between the parties of the government. I really can't go out on a limb and predict when the resolution might occur. We're going on two years now where this has been an issue. I will say that the longer this goes on, the more challenging it is to get the equipment back up and running. We do continue to reduce operating expenses in PZ and continue to let people leave the payroll because we need to limit the losses that are occurring here. So I don't have any fresh news about when we might expect that restart, unfortunately. In Venezuela, I would just say it's a very tough circumstance for all of the people of Venezuela. We haven't had any or significant \u2013 it's really been minimal impact to our operations and our facilities. Priority number one for us is keeping our people safe, and so we're operating with that intention in mind. And Nigeria just continues to be a challenging location as well. There has been some disruption to production facilities in the first quarter of the year. We continue to monitor for safety there as well.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Evan.\nEvan Calio: Great, I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse, your question, please.\nEdward Westlake: Yes, good morning, a question for Steve on Australia. You had the issue I think with the flow meter, and you sorted that out on the trains. I wanted just to confirm that there isn't any design difference between Gorgon and Wheatstone, and therefore, what the risks are in terms of starting up at Wheatstone, that it's all been fixed based on the learnings at Gorgon, if I understood you correctly.\nStephen W. Green: Yes, Ed. Thanks for the question. There are design differences. They're two different technologies in the plant between Gorgon and Wheatstone. But of any common equipment and any issues that we have dealt with in the startup of all three trains at Gorgon, we have communicated. And those issues have been addressed at Wheatstone to the extent they're common to Gorgon. That also includes \u2013 I mentioned our partner, Woodside, any issues that they have experienced in any of their facilities. We're benefiting from that as well, or Angola LNG. So any place we can get learnings or experience or borrow it, we're factoring that in and addressing it as best we can pre-startup to try to remove those variables.\nEdward Westlake: And then sticking with Australia, obviously at Gorgon you're talking about debottlenecking. It would be interesting to see what sort of debottlenecking uplift you can get from the plant, but also obviously there's Northwest Shelf, and there are other plants that need filling. Maybe how would those investments compete against each other? I obviously appreciate there's commercial terms to be negotiated as well.\nStephen W. Green: Right. I guess I would start with your second part of your question first. We do have active work going on now to assess our large portfolio of discovered resource and look for commercial opportunities to accelerate that and commercialize that as the market materializes. So that work is ongoing, whether it be through one of our facilities or third-party facilities. With respect to Gorgon and debottlenecking, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have been looking forward to the day where we are today at Gorgon where we have all three trains up and running. We can begin to now tune and improve performance in the system as a whole. We have some additional equipment that will boost capacity as we bring that online. I mentioned a couple of examples of that in the prepared remarks. But this is really an opportunity to exercise what I consider a real core competency of the company, and that is getting more and more out of assets once they're up and operating. A terrific example of that is our long experience at Tengiz, where we have consistently improved performance and efficiency and increased the throughput from that facility. And we're looking forward to having a similar experience at Gorgon as we go forward in time. Specific to the debottlenecking, we'll analyze those opportunities, and some of those will be relatively short-term that we can do while we're in operation. Others are more complex and will require engineering and scheduling into planned outages or turnarounds as we go forward in time.\nEdward Westlake: Thanks, Steve.\nStephen W. Green: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi, your question, please.\nAlastair R. Syme: Hi, everyone. Pat, can you talk about the cost trend on slide 12 a little bit, as you look back, how much you think those have been variable costs, such as energy and chemicals? And are you seeing any signs that that's beginning to come back? And I had a follow-up for Steve as well.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: So I would say just general in terms of inflationary pressures, the only place around the globe really that we are seeing inflationary pressures of any size would be in the Permian, and that's obviously being driven by activity levels in the Permian. And within the Permian, obviously we're working very hard to restrict that through our contracting strategy in terms of fixed-price contracts, indexed contracts, staggered contract terms, performance contracts, et cetera. Overall, we think that will be manageable for us, relatively small impact in 2017. And then outside the Permian, we really just haven't seen inflationary pressures. So I think in general, that's why I said that we intend \u2013 we're certainly striving to have a continued downward trend on operating expense in the remaining three quarters of the year, acknowledging that we will be bringing on additional production, and that will be an element going in the other direction.\nAlastair R. Syme: Thank you. And my follow-up to Steve \u2013 I know this is going to be a sensitive subject. But can you comment on what you think the Australian government is trying to achieve with its PRRT [Petroleum Resource Rent Tax] review and other aspects of the existing legislation that you would like to get changed?\nStephen W. Green: I think as an investor, there's no difference in Australia than we look anywhere. We look for stability of fiscal terms and conditions that we invest under to be maintained over the life of those investments. So we have been and have been engaged with the government on the PRRT question, and that is a cautionary note for all investors, not just us. But the government yesterday in Australia released the initial report, and any changes that are contemplated will be prospective, which is exactly what our position was, is you can't go back and change the rules of the game after the investments are made. And so I think we have good engagement with the government. It has been a bit of irony. I was there last week, and the second story on page 1A is the emerging gas crisis, or energy crisis on the East Coast, which of course a solution will demand significant capital investment. So I think Australia is appropriately trying to find the right balance between their fiscal needs in the government and preserving what has been a very, very successful regime for attracting large capital investment, especially in our sector.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Alastair.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Scotia Howard Weil, your question, please.\nBlake Fernandez: Folks, good morning. Congrats on the results. I had two questions for you on the Permian. I know you already addressed the operated rig count, but my question was on the non-operated rig count. I think you said the base case contemplated 13 non-operated rigs. And just based on the level of activity increases we're seeing in the industry, it just seems like there's probably upward pressure there. So can you confirm whether you're getting pressure from peers to maybe increase activity on that and whether that probably leads to some upside on your base case? And then I guess tying in with the Permian question, the second is on the oil price realizations in the U.S. It seems like there was a pretty healthy increase in U.S. oil relative to the benchmarks. I didn't know if there was something one-off or this is just a function of Permian ramping up and that representing better realizations relative to the rest of the portfolio. Thanks.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, yes. So, Blake, I would say on the NOJV [Non-Operated Joint Venture] issue, I don't really have any significant information that would suggest the NOJV plan is any different than we had outlined. Currently, we've got 13 gross NOJV rigs, so that's five net. And I see that \u2013 I think in our plan as we look forward, there was ramping up some, but I don't have any new information relative to that. And with regard to the realizations, there's nothing unusual there in terms of one-offs on realizations. It really is just as a function of WTI prices, San Joaquin Valley prices, Mars prices, et cetera, and how those move relative to one another.\nBlake Fernandez: Fair enough, thank you.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Blake.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH, your question, please.\nAnish Kapadia: Hi. My first question was really to Steve to think about the Southeast Asia business from a more strategic standpoint. You've divested of the Bangladesh assets. There have been quite a few stories in the press that you've been looking at least at divesting of maybe some of your other Southeast Asian assets. And then on the other side, you have got some predevelopment pre-FID decisions to make on things like Ubon and further developments in Indonesia. So I just wanted to get an idea of how you view Southeast Asia within the context of the portfolio and the strategic decisions that you're thinking about for that portfolio.\nStephen W. Green: Thanks for the question. Southeast Asia has long been and remains a core part of our upstream portfolio. We have a great business in Thailand, have had for 40-plus years. That business continues to perform very well. And in terms of incremental investments in Thailand beyond the base business, those are evaluated just like they are anywhere else in the company. The market, the terms and conditions, the resource, all those things \u2013 the cost of finding and development on a unit basis, all those things factor into our decision, whether it's Thailand or Indonesia as well. And our process for some time has been to go through the portfolio systematically and look at incremental investments on how they compete within the portfolio relative to our other opportunities. But notwithstanding the asset divestments that have been announced, Southeast Asia's still a very, very core part of our upstream portfolio and is performing well.\nAnish Kapadia: Thank you, and then a follow-up for Pat around cash flow. So you mentioned some impacts in Q1 that may turn around in the second half of the year, I think in terms of the working capital in particular. And I'm guessing also you've got the impact of projects ramping up in the second half of the year. So I'm just thinking in a flat oil price environment, should we expect significantly higher cash flow in the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2017? And also just related to that, are there any significant pension contribution impacts through the course of this year?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: So I would say in general, I think that's a good premise for you. If you look back over time, our first quarter tends to be typically our lowest cash generation quarter, and part of it is driven by the working capital. I did indicate that we saw a portion of that working capital most likely reversing between the end of this quarter and the end of the year, so I don't think you will get the same kind of penalty there per quarter. I'd also say \u2013 I mentioned the dividends, a potential coming in from TCO in the second half of the year, so that would be a positive in the remaining quarters of the year. If you go back to what I said back in March, one of the questions I had was about all of the summation of all of these \"headwinds\", and I had given an indication then of them being about $4 billion, a little bit over $4 billion for the year. And I still think that is a good element to think about when you consider the deferred tax impact, the working capital impact, and the difference between affiliate dividend and dividend earnings during the period. So all said, when you put that all together, I know there was a lot of numbers there. I do think the second part of the year we'll have stronger cash generation, not only from these reasons that I'm talking about, but production increases and the fact that these are high cash margin barrels that we're bringing on.\nAnish Kapadia: Okay, thanks. And just to clarify, that $4 billion, does that include the cash contributions to pensions?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: It would, it would.\nAnish Kapadia: Right, thank you.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Anish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.\nDoug Terreson: Good morning, everybody.\nFrank Mount: Hi, Doug.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Hi, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: To me a positive aspect of the capital allocation and the corporate governance changes that are underway at the company is the increased emphasis on cash returns at the business unit level and specifically on project execution, at least in my opinion. And while John [Watson] talked about this some at the analyst meeting, I wanted to see if you could provide a progress report on this process in the upstream business, the timeframes over which the teams are going to be judged, and really any other factors that you deem relevant to positive execution and performance in this area.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: It's a good question. I think the best place that I would go because where we're seeing it in action is in TCO because this is the most significant capital project that we have underway at this point in time of a longer duration. And so we've talked about the fact that we were increasing the overall engineering that was done before we began to essentially cut steel. We've now started fabrication in Korea and the Kazakhstani yards. We're monitoring \u2013 we've done more in terms of design assurance there on that project, optimizing contracting strategy, taking advantage of the lower-cost environment. So I really think the benchmark in terms of how this will turn out in terms of all of these elements that Jay [Pryor] and John have talked about before in terms of major capital project execution, the benchmark on how we're doing will be with regard to TCO and how well it is coming forward. And right now, the overall progress, we're on track with elements of fabrication and construction of the port and we're underway with constructing the village, the housing village, et cetera, and the drilling is going very well. So all of those efforts are really being focused in real time on the TCO project.\nDoug Terreson: Okay, great. It'll be a good test case. And then also, Pat, there's a $2 billion sales proceeds figure floating around in the press for Bangladesh. And so my question, is that your number or is it somebody else's number, or is that a no comment at this point?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: That's a no comment at this point, so thank you very much for giving me that third option.\nDoug Terreson: Okay, thanks a lot, guys.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank, your question, please.\nRyan Todd: Great, thanks. Maybe a follow-up to the earlier cash flow questions. You generated I think roughly $900 million of free cash flow in the quarter beyond the dividend and you used it to pay down some debt. I realize there was an asset sale at the tail end of the quarter. But as you start to generate modest amounts of discretionary cash flow beyond CapEx and the dividend, how should we think about the use of the discretionary cash flow? How would you prioritize debt paydown versus buyback versus incremental capital spend?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, so I'm just going to go back and reiterate what our priorities have long been. The first priority is going to be given to growing the dividend when we feel cash flow and earnings can support it for the long term, and by that I mean in perpetuity. Secondly, we look at future additional investment opportunities that we've got because we do need to continue to grow future revenue streams. And then we look at the balance sheet. It is important for us to continue to have a strong balance sheet. And what you saw in this quarter is really a flex in our commercial paper program, and that's part of why we have a commercial paper program is to take flex like this. So all of those are important to us. We do balance that. We're at a 24% debt ratio, which is an okay place to be, I would say. But over time, I'd like to see us move a little bit lower in the debt profile when cash flow permits us to do that. Maintaining a AA is important to us. We did just meet with the rating agencies. We did just get affirmed by Moody's as a AA stable. We haven't heard from S&P yet, but it's an important element for us.\nRyan Todd: Okay, thanks. And then maybe you have a slide there in the deck. I think it's slide 10, showing efficiency gains across the base portfolio as well. And obviously for investors the efficiency gains in the U.S. onshore has been a huge area of focus and generally is quite transparent. Can you talk a little bit more about the efficiency gains that you're seeing across the broader global portfolio? Do you think the market underestimates gains outside the U.S? And is the 30 to 35-plus percentage type of gains that you're showing here and a couple anecdotal things, is that representative of the type of gains you're seeing across the broader portfolio?\nStephen W. Green: The chart that you referenced, of course, is specific to our Thailand operations. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are transferring both people and learnings from those operations into the Permian, into AMBU [Appalachia-Michigan Business Unit], into other places where we have this factory well approach. And we are seeing those kind of gains in efficiency and driving down our unit cost. Another example that's probably a little less visible perhaps comes from Indonesia. Last year in Indonesia, in our Duri operations, which is a heavy oil steam flood, we were able to drive down the cost of our steam, which is our largest line item of OpEx, by over 40%, without degradating the production, no impact to production. So again, as I said in response to a question about Gorgon, this is the sweet spot of Chevron's core capability is transferring learnings and ways to get efficiency and operate assets in the portfolio and get more and more out of them as we go forward.\nFrank Mount: Thanks, Ryan.\nRyan Todd: Sure, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, I think we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP, your question, please.\nTheepan Jothilingam: Yes, hi. Good morning, Pat. Good morning, gentlemen.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning.\nTheepan Jothilingam: Just coming back to the financials, could you perhaps just talk a little bit about cash taxes? I know you've quantified the deferred tax impact this quarter. But just going forward at Chevron, let's say at $50, how should we think of cash tax rate? And then my follow-up question was just on PZ. Again, broadly speaking, what type of run rate should we be thinking about on OpEx and how we actually capture that back if and when PZ volumes are back onstream? Thank you.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, so I'll take PZ first. I don't want to get into describing what our ongoing operating costs are here when we've got an asset that is not operating. I will just say that when it does come back online, these cumulative losses will be taken into account in terms of the eventual recovery, tax recovery that's available to us. In terms of cash tax, this is a hard area for us to forecast at this particular time because of just issues that I've explained before about tax loss carryforwards and the fact that we've got different jurisdictions with different circumstances as their current tax position standpoint. I would say in general, we do still have some jurisdictions at current prices that are generating tax losses. And so that means that these tax losses will be carried forward into future periods. And when oil prices rise from $50 to $60 to $70, if you assume that hypothesis, we do need higher prices here to recover some of those previously deferred or those tax losses that have been carried forward that cannot then be carried back and will become a cash benefit, a relative cash benefit in future periods. That's really the best guidance that I can give you at this point in time. At low prices, there is not a lot of \u2013 we do have cash taxes in some locations, but it is not in all locations.\nTheepan Jothilingam: Is there any way to quantify that number in terms of an aggregate number there, if prices were to recover, Chevron could use in terms of tax allowances?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I don't have it handy here. It's something I can consider for future disclosures.\nTheepan Jothilingam: Great. Thank you, Pat.\nFrank Mount: I Thanks, Theepan.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, I think that concludes our call for this morning. I want to thank everybody for your time today, and we certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on the call. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day."}], "2019": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-02-01 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Mike Wirth. Please go ahead.\nMike Wirth: Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements, please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Back in March, I laid out Chevron's strategy to win in any environment. I outlined our three compelling strengths, an advantage portfolio, sustainability at lower prices, and a strong balance sheet. I also indicated that the combination of these distinct advantages together with the commitments to action highlighted in blue will deliver growing free cash flow and shareholder returns. In 2018, we delivered. We grew oil and gas production by more than 7% achieving our highest ever annual production. We grew cash margins in our operated upstream assets, contributing to an improvement in cash returns. We lowered our unit costs and we sold $2 billion of assets. These outcomes yielded record free cash flow, a dividend increase and the initiation of the share repurchase program. 2018 was a very successful year and we intend to build on this momentum in 2019. Turning to Slide 4, a view of our sources and uses of cash. Excluding working capital, we generated over $31 billion in cash flow from operations when we achieved record free cash flow of nearly $17 billion, the highest level ever achieved by Chevron in any price environment. This allowed us to deliver on all pore of our financial priorities. For the 31st consecutive year, we maintained our commitment to dividend growth and paid out 8.5 billion in cash dividends to our shareholders. Earlier this week, we announced a $0.07 per share increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share, representing a 6% increase. Second, we allocated capital across a diverse portfolio and funded our highest return projects. We have confident these investments position us for sustainable growth and free cash flow. Third, we strengthened our balance sheet and paid down debt by 4.5 billion. Finally, we began repurchasing shares in the third quarter and increased the rate in the fourth quarter, demonstrating further confidence in our future cash generation. With that I'll, turn the call over to Pat who will take you through the financial results. Pat?\nPat Yarrington: Thanks Mike. Turning to Slide 5, an overview of our financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings were $3.7 billion or $1.95 per diluted share. 2018 full year earnings were $14.8 billion or $7.74 per diluted share, up more than 60% from 2017. In the quarter, foreign exchange gains of 268 million were offset by a special item related to the project write off. The detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. For the full year earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange totaled 15.5 billion. Return on capital employed for 2018 was 8.2%, up from 5% in 2017. Our debt ratio at yearend was 18% and our net debt ratio was approximately 14%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends, brining the full year total to 8.5 billion; and we increased the rate of our share repurchases from 750 million in the third quarter to 1 billion in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 6. For the full year, cash flow from operations totaled 30.6 billion about 50% higher than 2017. Headwinds as we defined them in the past, total 2.2 billion for the year in line with my original guidance. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was 9.2 billion. It was lower than in the third quarter primarily because of lower commodity prices, but it was above first quarter when prices were comparable. This improvement was in the year was due to growth in production. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4 billion and 13.8 billion for the year. And resulting free cash flow of almost $17 billion reduced our dividend breakeven price. We are covering our cash CapEx and dividend at just under $53 Brent, without consideration of asset sale proceeds. Before moving off cash flow a little guidance for 2019. As prices hold at current levels, we expect headwinds for 2019 to be between $2 billion and $3 billion. Now onto Slide 7. Full year 2018 earnings of 14.8 billion were approximately 5.6 billion higher than 2017. Special items, primarily the absence of U.S. tax reform gain of 2 billion lower gains on asset sales and an increase in charges relating to project write off resulted in a net 3.9 billion decrease in earnings. Our previous foreign exchange impact benefited earnings between the periods by 1.1 billion. Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by about 9.3 billion between periods primarily because of higher realization and increased lifting, slightly offsetting where higher operating expenses largely associated with continued ramp up production along with additional taxes and other costs. Downstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by just over 90 million, lower volumes reflected sales of our Canadian and South African refining and marketing assets while higher operating expenses were associated with planned turnaround activity in the U.S. These earnings were mostly offset by favorable timing effects and improved results at CPChem. In the other segment excluding special items and foreign exchange, net charges for the period increased by almost 750 million, due primarily to higher interest expense and lower tax deductibility for corporate charges. Full year net charges $2.3 billion in line with our guidance. Our 2019 guidance for the other segment remains about $2.4 billion in net charges. As a reminder though, quarterly results in this segment are non-ratable. Now on Slide 8. 2018 production was 2.93 million barrels a day, an increase of 202,000 barrels a day or more than 7% from 2017. This is the highest level of production in the Company's history. Excluding the impact of 2018 assets sales, production grew approximately 8% or 1% above the top of the guidance range we provided last January. Major capital projects increased production by 227,000 barrels a day as we continue to ramp up production at multiple projects most significantly Wheatstone and Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased 132,000 barrels a day, primarily in the Permian where production grew by more than 70% from 2017. Base declines net of production from new wells, mostly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria were 19,000 barrels a day. The impact of asset sales in particular from the U.S. mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico Shelf and Elk Hills field in California reduced production by 50,000 barrels per day. Entitlement effects in total reduced production by 46,000 barrels a day, 17,000 of which was due to the effect of higher prices during the year. Higher plan turnaround effects primarily at Angola LNG and Tengiz, reduced production between years by 26,000 barrels per day. I'll now hand it back to Mike.\nMike Wirth: Thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 9, reserve replacement continues to be a real success story. In 2018, our reserve replacement ratio was 136%. We added almost 400 million more barrels than we produced and divested. This outcome is especially significant because it was achieved while growing production more than 7%. Our reserves to production ratio stands at a healthy 11.3 years, showing the strength and sustainability of our portfolio. Our five year reserve replacement ratio of 117% further illustrates as strength through the price downturn. Moving to Slide 10. We continue to maintain our commitment to capital discipline. Total C&E in 2018 was 20.1 billion. This included approximately 600 million of inorganic expense for which we don't budget, primarily related to bonus payments for offshore leases in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. The stacked bar depicts our organic C&E budget for 2019 of $20 billion. Within this budget, the cash component is 13.7 billion while the remaining 6.3 billion is expenditures by affiliates, primarily TCO and CPChem. In our 2019 budget, 3.6 billion is allocated to the Permian and another 1.6 billion is allocated to other shale and tight assets. We expect approximately 70% of our total 2019 spends to deliver cash within two years. Our current spend profile has significantly lower execution risk relative to the past, and we have several large scale major capital projects underway concurrently. Turning to Slide 11. I would like to provide an update on our portfolio optimization efforts. During 2018, we received before tax asset sale proceeds of $2 billion, with the largest contributors being the divestment of our Southern Africa refining and marketing business and our interest in the Elk Hills field in California. We recently completed the sale of our interest in the Rosebank project West of Shetlands in the UK. In addition, we expect to close the sale of our interest in the Danish underground consortium in the first half of 2019, and earlier this week, we executed an agreement to sell our interest in the project deal in Brazil. We continue marketing our UK central North Sea and Azerbaijan assets. And with all the investments, we are focused on generating good value from any transaction. The progress we made last year is consistent with our guidance of $5 billion to $10 billion in asset sale proceeds from 2018 to 2020. Turning to the Permian. Production in the fourth quarter was 377,000 barrels per day, up 172,000 barrels per day or 84% relative to the same quarter last year. Annual production was up more than 70%. In the Permian, we remained focused on returns. We are not chasing a production target, nor are we altering our plans based on the price of the day. Over the last two years, we transacted more than 150,000 acres through swaps, joint ventures, farm outs and sales, further optimizing our large land position. In 2018, we had Takeaway capacity for oil and liquids that was more than sufficient, and we've already added more capacity this year. We're pleased with our position and leading performance in the Permian. In just two years, we've doubled our rig count, increased our resource base, decreased unit development and operating costs and more than doubled our production. We will provide new guidance for our Permian portfolio in March. Moving to LNG, the plants at Gorgon and Wheatstone performed well during the fourth quarter and average almost 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was despite higher summer temperatures in December. Higher temperatures as you know generally reduce LNG throughput. We loaded 329 LNG cargoes from Gorgon and Wheatstone last year. We have now commissioned that Wheatstone domestic gas plant and expect to provide gas to the local market in the next few weeks. We will begin our routine cycle of planned turnarounds at Gorgon this year. We will be on a four-year cycle with one frame undergoing maintenance each of the first three years and the fourth year having no turnarounds scheduled. We expect turnarounds at the Gorgon fence to last about 40 days. These turnarounds offer the opportunities perform routine maintenance and also to make small enhancements that increase reliability and throughput. We anticipate significant cash generation from these assets for many years to come. Slide 14 shows our production outlook for this year, assuming a $60 Brent price. We expect production to be 4% to 7% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2018 asset sales. Our growth is largely driven by shale and tight assets and full year production from Train 2 at Wheatstone. These forecasts always need to acknowledge the uncertainties in our business as noted on the slide. In summary, we anticipate a third consecutive year of strong production growth. Moving to Slide 15, as announced earlier this week, we signed an agreement with Petrobras America Inc. to purchase its 110,000 barrel per day refinery and related assets in Pasadena, Texas. This addition to our Gulf Coast refining system allows us to process more domestic light crude, supply a portion of our retail market in Texas and Louisiana with Chevron produced products, and realize regional synergies through coordination with the refinery in Pascagoula. We expect to close by midyear and will provide further updates in our analyst meeting in March. Now just a few comments about future expectations. We expect positive production trends to continue in the first quarter and throughout 2019, reflected in the 4% to 7% growth forecast. As early as first quarter, we expect additional co-lending to TCO in support of the future growth project. In downstream, we expect low refinery turnaround activity in the first quarter which as you recall from our previous disclosures equates to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of less than $100 million. Earlier in the call, Pat provided you guidance on cash flow headwinds and corporate charges for 2019. And as we communicated earlier this week, there will be a $0.07 per share quarterly dividend increase and we anticipate $1 billion in share repurchases during the quarter. Moving to Slide 17 I would like to share a few closing thoughts. As I mentioned before, we intend to win in any abundance. As a result of our advantaged portfolio, capital discipline, lower execution risk, strong balance sheet and record level free cash flow, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary, and will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Your question please.\nPhil Gresh: First question, you talked about the dividend breakeven a $53 in 2018, you stepped up a dividend here at a higher rate than last year, and you\u2019re also stepping up the buyback. So I guess may if you could just elaborate a little bit on this breakeven where you see that going? Is it moving lower and giving you more confidence than the more return on capital? Or just how you think about that capital?\nMike Wirth: Well, Phil, we worked really hard over the last few years to get that breakdown. We were in the 80s not that long ago and have made significant progress in bringing the dividend breakeven down. We have provided I think a simple way to think about it in some of our prior definitions, and as we look forward in 2019, we think the dividend breakeven remains in the area where it was last year. You see we've got really strong cash flows coming in right now, and the commitment to a competitive increase in the dividends the confidence to step up through right a share repurchases is evidence of our confidence that we've got those cash flows coming in, in a price environments, any reasonable price environment as Pat has said, that we will be able to sustain those kinds of payouts. The other thing I would just point out is, our capital spending is still the same. And we have got the ability to provide strong production growth, sustain the kind of cash margins that you have seen out of our portfolio and do that at really modest capital spending relative to our history.\nPhil Gresh: The second question I guess would just be on that capital spending budget specifically for 2019. The Permian piece pretty flattish year-over-year which I think you've highlighted last quarter. The non-Permian shale piece just got the up quite a bit here. And I just wanted to know if you could maybe elaborate on that a little, not just stealing the thunder from the analyst day but. Is that something that is going to be contributing to this 2019 production growth guidance? Or is that something that you're ramping in '19, it would be more of a future contribution?\nMike Wirth: Well, we are beginning to ramp in the other basins. So, we've added rigs actually in all the other shale and tight basins in which we operate. We've seen significant reductions in development costs in the Marcellus, in the Duvernay and in Vaca Muerta as we have shared the learnings and improvements that are emanating from the large scale activity we have in the Permian. The economics on each of these are compelling. The EURs are coming up. And while the Permian maybe in the spotlight within our shale and tight portfolio, it's far from the only asset that we have. The other thing that I just note is, we have begun an eight well appraisal program in El Trapial in the north of the Vaca Muerta. We are currently producing in the Sothern area Lana Compa\u00f1\u00eda, but our folks are intrigued by the possibilities up in the north at El Trapial, and we continue to prosecute that program. We have also picked up additional acreage in the Narambuena, a 25,000 net acres where non-operated with YPS, and we got a full well pilot that we plan to execute there in 2019 as well. So great potential in Argentina and we really like our entire shale and tight portfolio; and again, it brings some of the characteristics we have been talking about, which is short cycle time, attractive economics, low development costs and the ability to generate cash relatively rapidly. The last thing I'll say about that is it brings a much lower risk profile than multiyear multibillion-dollar capital projects.\nPhil Gresh: And Pat, what was the amount of the co-lend for TCO?\nPat Yarrington: In 2018 the co-lend was zero.\nPhil Gresh: For the 1Q guide, I\u2019m sorry.\nPat Yarrington: Oh, the 1Q guide, okay. So, I don\u2019t have like I would say, a confirm number here for you because it will depend on what happens to price. It will depend on what happened and how the cash flow that\u2019s generated from operations matches against the investment profile for the project. It will also depend on the dividend distribution requirements for the partnership. But I think order of magnitude, if you go back and you look at 2016 when we first started the co lending that was about $2 billion, and I think as order of magnitude starting off base, maybe think about $2 billion for this year. But as I say, we reserve the right to change that number as the year progresses and we see what actually happens to prices and the investment profile and as discussions are under way on dividend.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Chain from Barclays. Your question please.\nPaul Chain: Mike, you talk about Argentina. I'm wondering, given the political environment, the infrastructure or lack of infrastructure over there, how quickly you think you can proceed with the development plan? And any kind of timeline or the pace or the capital outlook, any kind of data that you can share?\nMike Wirth: We will probably talk about this little bit more in March Paul. But I'd just reiterate, YPF has been a very, very good partner there. There Macri government is committed to improving the investment climate in Argentina and has instituted a number of reforms to encourage and support energy development in the country. We have great resource there that\u2019s benefiting from the Permian learning and competitive economics, multiple blocks that we picked up, and much of production can actually stay in the country. So at this point, yes, the infrastructure is not developed the way that it is in United States or perhaps North America more broadly, but there's a commitment on the part of the government to do that. And we'll pace our developments with the gas and liquids take away and market conditions. So, the realities on the ground in Argentina are a little bit different, but I got to see the resources tremendous, and we\u2019re very encouraged by the policy reforms that have been put forth by the government.\nPaul Chain: And for Pasadena, the refinery that you just bought, what's the game plan for that facility? I mean, are you going to need to make a significant investment up front to bring them to the Chevron standard? Because that facility probably has been underinvested at least for 20, if not 30-plus years and the labor relationship has been always very rocky. So what's the game plan? And how much is the upfront investment? And secondly, are you going to run it as a full-blown facility or that is sort of by an extension of Pascagoula?\nMike Wirth: So, let me try to respond to that Paul as best I can. We just executed an agreement this week. We don\u2019t expect to close here until somewhat later here in the first half of the year. So, it's a little premature for me to lay out an investment plan fully actually closed the transaction. In the due diligence, we have satisfied ourselves that we can operate the facility safely and reliably at the standards that we would expect. And so, I don\u2019t think you should have any concerns there. It meets our three primary criteria. One, we are getting it at a good price, and I believe one of the ways that you take risk out of the final acquisitions as you should don't overpay, and I don't think that we are over paying for the asset. It's in a great location and that allows us to integrate to increasing like crude production. Out of West Texas that allows us to serve our markets in Texas with product that we run through our own system as opposed to exchange or purchase product, and it will allow us to optimize and integrate with the Pascagoula refinery. The third thing is, it provides good strong economics and because of our system in the three kind of strategic levers that I just talked about we ought to be able to optimize that refinery as a part of our system in a way that is different than what the current owner can simply because they don't have those other assets and those other positions. And so within our business, this fills a bit of a gap, it gives us the ability to capture value in multiple different dimensions. And overtime, we will evaluate what investments we may choose to make there as we would in the other refinery. I would expect those to be relatively modest. I would expect them to be thoughtfully paced overtime and fit within the level of spending that we've established over the past many years in our downstream business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nNeil Mehta: The first question I had with around Tengiz. In the latest on the project are you feeling good about the timeline and thoughts on cost and the contingency as well?\nMike Wirth: So I probably don\u2019t have a lot to add to what we have previously said on this. We are still on schedule, so we are still targeting a 2022 startup. As I think Jay mentioned on our third quarter call, on site productivity has improved. We had a very good summer. The logistics are working very well as we are moving modules now from Korea to the staging points. We can't move through the inland waterway system during the wintertime because it freezes up, but modules arriving from Korea from Italy and from Kazakhstan. The quality levels are very high. We are about halfway through the project about 50% complete at this point. And in 2019, it will be a key year. There's a lot of activity in terms of moving modules into the Caspian to the site a lot of fieldwork where we will see if these productivity gains can be built upon again in 2019 and it\u2019s certainly a year where we will reduce uncertainty. Jay is actually headed there this weekend and will be there in next week. And when we get to New York in March, he will have had recent field visits to Kazakhstan and also to Korea. He was in Korea visiting the module fabrication yards last week and he will be in a position to give you very good insight into exactly where we stand and what our expectations are.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, looking forward to that. And the follow-up: we just want to get some more color on the share buyback. To follow up on Phil's question, I think most of us were expecting $750 million. It came in at $1 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the share buyback program, our view had been that this program would be kind of a base load $3 billion program into perpetuity, but you are demonstrating that you are willing to flex and lean into it. Can you talk about the philosophy behind that share repurchase program? Is a higher run rate potentially sustainable? And how you think about flexing it from a big picture and then a more granular perspective?\nMike Wirth: Yes, I\u2019m going to let Pat take it.\nPat Yarrington: I think the keyword here is suitability and what you saw with our increase was just, our view of future cash generation, the confidence that we have in our future cash generation and the belief that we could move that rate of quarterly purchase up to $4 billion. When we first initiated this back in the second quarter call, the points that I made were that we really wanted to have this be through the cycle and sustainable through the cycle. And so that\u2019s really we paid the $3 billion because we thought that would be supportable to any reasonable price environment. We obviously had stronger prices in 2018 and not that come off a little bit, but we still feel very strong about our cash generation in 2019 and frankly in the years to come. You will note, maybe you won\u2019t note, but we did release an 8K this morning as well that talked to the fact that our board has supported a resolution for a $25 billion with share repurchase program with no term limit. So I think that $25 billion gives you can indication of that commitment, that we have to this program our view about the sustainability. Yes, I think that should be very strong message to our investor about our willingness and intent to boost shareholders distribution.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.\nJason Gammel: I wanted to ask a question about the cost structure of the Company. And the reason I ask is you have already taken a lot of cost out of the upstream, but you seem to be with divestitures and some explorations concentrating more and more into the highest-quality assets. I am just wondering if there is the potential to take further overhead out of the business through medium-term shutting down regional offices, etc. This seems to be right out of the Mike Wirth downstream playbook of taking further cost out and enhancing returns through concentration.\nMike Wirth: Jason, I will give you short answer and the answer is yes. I think in a commodity business you always have to looking for efficiencies, and I think scale matters and we need to continue to look for ways to control our own destiny. And a big part is moving into assets that have inherently lower cost structures in continuous seeking an efficient overhead structure to support that. I will tell you that, not only can you do that through what I would call conventional means in a ways there is always been done, but technology today offers us the ability to do even more as we bring digital technologies into our business and can do things in a business that really grew up in an analog world. There's a lot of opportunity to find more efficiencies. The other thing when you\u2019re growing your business, it's important to pay attention to unit cost and we've seen unit cost come down significantly. We see this year another 2% reduction or so in unit cost, and as you look out to 2020 and 2021, I think that number can go up even more in terms of the percent reduction or the other way to say as unit cost can come down even more. So, we need to be prepared to be competitive in an environment where prices are not what we look to and we will continue to work on cost efficiencies across our entire portfolio.\nJason Gammel: Just a very quick follow-up, can you talk about the ramp-up progress at Big Foot?\nMike Wirth: Yes, so, we have got the first well online and it's been performing very well. It came on in November of last year. The second well is being drilled and completed as we speak, and we anticipate that going on here in the first quarter. So we will steadily move through the process of adding wells at Bigfoot and you can expect that to be part of the production story in 2019.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question please.\nPaul Sankey: You mentioned that you've done about 150,000 acres of swaps or sales I believe in the Permian, Mike. And hi, Pat, by the way. Sorry, I was slightly caught off guard there. I wanted just an update on where your final numbers are for Permian acreage. And how you feel about that, given that there's potentially some fairly major assets available. I guess you are strongly outperforming your volume targets. Can you also talk about your returns there? Because there's concerns that you are perhaps not as leading-edge as we might want you to be in terms of your Permian performance on a returns basis.\nMike Wirth: Yes, so, we will share lot more detail in March because as you can see, the performance out of the Permian continues to be exceptionally strong. With the large land position that we have, we have got good currency and optionality, we try to improve that because everybody is interested in drilling longer laterals finding contiguous development areas. And so, with our 2.2 million net acres and 1.7 million in the Midland of Delaware basins, we have got lots of levers with which to optimize our position and the nice thing about these transactions is they are truly win-win because you can transact with other people. There is enough economic value creation that you're not trying to split a finite pie, but you creating a bigger pie for both. Our currently disclosed resource, there is 1.2 billion barrels that\u2019s a figure that we would expect to grow. So our confidence in the Permian is higher today than it was the last time that I spoke to you. When you talk about returns, we put out data before on the returns that we are seeing and they are well locked in 35% plus range as we have moved to longer laterals of better basis of design and even in a modest price environment, we are seeing very, very strong returns. It's as good as or better than anything else we could be doing. We are returns-driven and I mentioned that in my prepared remarks and I'll reiterate that, and as returns across the lifecycle of the asset and as returns across the entire value chain. And so we are not looking to put the most wells online or have the biggest IPs, we are looking to get the best returns out of the system. We paused at 20 rigs for several years. We've been telling you we are going to grow to a 20 rig fleet. And as you go through that kind of growth, you stress the system little bit. And so, we're pausing in terms of adding rates at this point in order to ensure that anything that needs some proof from a thought performance standpoint will. We engage in regular benchmarking within the basin. We have a number of non operated joint ventures, we got really good visibility into what other operators are doing and what levels they are performing at. And I will simply tell you that we\u2019re continuing to improve performance in every dimension in intent to continue to and using benchmarking to identify the areas where we can get better. So, our Jay will talk a lot more about this in March. We will have a breakout session that will give you a chance to go into details with questions as well. But we feel like we are delivering better performance and across the value chain, I mentioned we been well situated with takeaway capacity and we\u2019ve added capacity already in 2019. So we\u2019re able to capture margin across the value chain and later this year that will include refining margin.\nPaul Sankey: Thanks Mike. And we know also that you have got an advantaged mineral right position there, which seems to be one of the issues with any potential major deals that might occur in the Permian in the near future. Mike, if I could ask you another one. I was going to make some elaborate joke about you keeping it competitive by not having just the CEO on the call but also the CFO. But obviously referring to Exxon's CEO being on the call this morning, there is a major number of major differentiations between the two companies and one of them is your flat CapEx outlook. I think that you would do well to maintain that. I think it is a relatively long-term outlook as it stands. You have just drifted towards the top of the range without going above it. What are the prospects of you actually seeing falling CapEx and CapEx that surprises to the downside going forward, given that your growth trajectory looks very good for a company of your size?\nMike Wirth: Yes, so we were committed to capital discipline. We can grow our business at modest capital levels and we have more good things to invest and then we will invest in. Last year there are two notable examples. We relinquished our rights to the Tigris development project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, not because it's not a good project, not because it can\u2019t generate a return but we have better opportunities within our portfolio, same thing with Rosebank good projects, a lot of resource but one that probably fits better for someone else than it does for us given our alternatives to invest. And so, we will continue to make those kinds of choices. The one thing that came up in the call earlier were the other shale and tight opportunities, and those are really economic as well. And so, there are opportunities for us to whether you're talking in the Permian or some of these other areas overtime to find highly attractive opportunities to invest further capital generate strong returns, minimize execution risk, short cycle annual. And as our portfolio grows, we were up 5% in production, two years ago 7% last year we just outlined 4% to 7% this year growing portfolio overtime does require modestly higher based capital spending that would go with that. And so, we're committed to capital discipline and I think you've characterized our ability to grow it. So it's relatively flat capital well. We will update forward views beyond what we've already articulated when we get to the March meetings.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Simmons. Your question please.\nBlake Fernandez: Two questions for you. One: could you talk a little bit about Venezuela? I know it's early days, but obviously you do have exposure there, both upstream and downstream and just any helpful thoughts that might help us out on our end.\nMike Wirth: Yes, I can give you quick update on Venezuela, Blake. First and most important thing for us is the safety of our people on the ground, and so that's what we are really focused on. We also want to be sure the operations where we have an interest are safe and environmentally sound. And I can tell you that that is the case. We have worked closely with the governments to be sure that we understand the intent of the sanctions within a number of new general licenses issued by the Treasury Department. And so, we are in close consultation to be sure we understand them and how they are to be applied. And I will say that the U.S. government has been very interested and engaging with us to understand our position on the ground. And we continue to operate and I think for the foreseeable future we feel like we can maintain a good stable operation and the safe operation on the ground in Venezuela. If you look at it from the downstream side in the U.S., Pascagoula is the one refinery of ours that tends to run Venezuelan crude and it runs 70,000, 75,000 barrels give or take. For some time, the prospects of actions like this have been clear and so we have had contingency plans in place. We have got alternate sourcing. We have got plenty of crude in tank for Pascagoula. We have got crude on the water there. And so, we are good here for the balance of the first quarter and maybe a little bit beyond and then back to visit our contingency planning into a full-scale execution right now. So, we will keep the refinery full with the crude. We will optimize and I think we feel like we are going to able to navigate through this. Our biggest hope is for stability on the ground in Venezuela and the safety of, not only our employees, but the contractors and the people in Venezuela.\nBlake Fernandez: The second question: I know you've kind of covered Pasadena and we will get some additional color in March. But just more broadly speaking, I think you have kind of alluded to a potential acquisition of a refinery on the Gulf Coast for some time. The size of this is 110,000 barrels a day or so, which isn't small, but it's not really large in context of some of the Gulf Coast facilities. Does this satisfy kind of your appetite or integration potential there? Or do you think there is additional scope to kind of expand that overtime?\nMike Wirth: I don\u2019t want to speculate really we got one transaction here that we have signed an agreement on. The key is value and the ability for it to not only yield value on a standalone basis, but to integrate into our network and to be sure we can capture value out of them so we are focused on that with the Pasadena refinery. And I think I will leave it at that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nRoger Read: I know all the really fun stuff has got to wait to March, but maybe to take a look at your CapEx mix. You mentioned 70% has a 2-year or less weighting to cash flow, whereas the rest obviously longer. Do you think as we not so much look at a total CapEx number but the mix within that CapEx, does that start to change back over the next couple years? I'm thinking number one: you signed a long-term deepwater rig contract obviously aimed at some of the more challenging parts of the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. So as things like that start to come in, do we see that start to move maybe to more of a 50/50 on CapEx? Or is that something you want to maintain maybe more at the 70/30 level as we think over the next several years?\nMike Wirth: Yes, Roger, it\u2019s a good question because our mix has shifted very dramatically from it was not long ago and its come down by 50% from the high watermark and that shifted in terms of makeup. I think both important issues and going back to Paul Sankey's question. I think that is the new normal for us. We got in this year budget a little bit over $5 million for shale and tight, 3.6 in the Permian, 1.6 on other shale and tight. And overtime, I think that number is likely to grow rather than on shrink. We get FGP which is in the peak spending years this year and next. And so, that's a non-trivial amount little bit over $4 billion in this year's budget. And so as that moves past the fleet and comes down, it creates room for other things and that could include deepwater, it could include more shale and tight or other major capital projects. On the under deepwater our incent was to have a ratable development program and I think one of the things that we have learned over this past cycle I mentioned, we have very large MCP underway simultaneously is that that introduces execution risk that is real. And so, our intent would be to have a balanced approach as we go forward and not to find ourselves. So overly skewed to that kind of risk that that it becomes an issue that's difficult to manage and because we've got the really strong shale and tight portfolio, I think that plus our base business which again is requires investment, but it's typically short cycle and trip to go from capital spent to cash in the door. I think the kind of range that we\u2019re today is more likely to plus or minus be the range you would see in the future as opposed to something that flips back the other direction.\nRoger Read: And then just to beat the Pasadena refining horse a little bit harder here, part of the acquisition indicated some undeveloped acreage. Are we wrong to think about this as just a refining acquisition and maybe should think about it more as an infrastructure opportunity across the board? I'm thinking we're moving more and more towards crude exports from the US.\nMike Wirth: I think there is a reason we disclose that because the asset there is not simply the refinery, but it's the port access, it\u2019s the tankage and it's the land. And I mentioned a couple of times that, our goal is to integrate this into our system. That means our upstream system or downstream system our trading system, and when I was young pup one of the lessons I learned from Susan engineer in one of our refineries is, he said, the cheapest process we have in this refineries is call the tank. And so, there are times when we can fall in love with building complex equipment and there are realities that you can create optionality and margin through infrastructure and commercial activity at relatively lower investment. And I think this asset offers us on the opportunity to not just participate in the refining margin, but also to look at the other ways that through our integrated system we can capture value across the entire value chain both up and downstream and that's the way we are approaching this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\nSam Margolin: Mike, I'm going to try to not ask you to say the same thing again in a different way. But one of the outcomes of the much Permian growth is maybe that the free cash flow profile of the Permian as a standalone entity has been pulled forward significantly. And maybe that is sort of an obvious statement or it is not new. But it seems like that is an important pendulum swing with respect to how you might think about additional long-cycle projects. So among all these other factors that are sort of -- that you have commented on kind of pointing you to thinking about expanding the portfolio in deepwater or other long-cycle areas, is that something that's important, too? Or is that more something that is on plan and you are just thinking about that within the buyback and the dividend growth and all your other sort of uses of cash that are out there?\nMike Wirth: So I think the increase performance of the Permian is a good new story. We did spend little more capital last year because we were finding that we can drill more hole we have changed our basis of designs, so little bit of capital overrun was related to the good news story that we are getting a lot more production out of the Permian. And our guidance has been we are free cash flow positive in 2020, and I think that\u2019s still a good way for you to think about it. As we have reached the crossover points it crosses over. And we have increased the dividend that Pat has already addressed the confidence in increasing the rate at which we are repurchasing shares and our intent to sustain that through the cycle. Having strong free cash flow creates alternatives and we intend to use the free cash flow to be very mindful of the need for shareholder distributions and also to look for good investment opportunities. I mentioned we were able to meet all four priorities this last year in terms of dividend investments balance sheet and share repurchases and our intent is to continue to respect that going forward. This kind of growth and free cash flow allows us to do that.\nSam Margolin: Okay. And just on a related note; I guess this one is for Pat. Is there -- leverage came down a lot. Is there a target leverage to think about conceptually? Or is it just something that is going to be a function of commodity prices in terms of the rate at which the balance sheet fluctuates here?\nPat Yarrington: Sam, we don\u2019t have a target leverage rate, we think of the balance sheet as being the outcome of other previously outstanding decisions about how we use the cash that we are generating. As I have said in the past, maybe a 20% leverage ratio on average through the cycles. And during the stronger price environment, you would obviously build back your balance sheet some and when you are in the weaker price environment you use it some. So, I think that\u2019s really what we are trying to -- that\u2019s kind of the sweet spot or the sweet area that we are trying to play in. Having a good balance sheet, it\u2019s a good insurance policy. And having a good balance sheet, allows us for both dividend and share repurchases to sustain those through any period of price weakness. And we feel that that\u2019s an important component.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please.\nAlastair Syme: It was really just one on your view on the state of the Gulf Coast chemical polyethylene market and how that makes you think about potential expansion plans. Thank you.\nMike Wirth: We\u2019re still very positive on the petrochemical investments opportunity and particularly here in the states. I think it\u2019s a good long-term story. We've seen some pressure on margins here recently because feedstock costs in the third quarter were up. I think all in the chain margins have been under little bit of pressure, but these things happen in commodity markets with long cycle time for projects, and kinds of ebbs and flows in the economy. So, that hasn't fundamentally changed our view on the attractiveness of the sector.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: And Mike, we always appreciate you getting on these calls, so thanks again for doing it this time around. Mike, my question might actually be for Pat. Pat, you talked about the $13-billion-plus of cash spending. Can you give us an idea as the affiliate spending rolls off with Tengiz completed, how do you anticipate that cash CapEx to trend, given that you are holding the line on the $18 billion to $20 billion absolute spending at least through 2020?\nPat Yarrington: I think Mike, answer that question in a way, although, we didn\u2019t split out cash verses total headline C&E. But as you see TCO's spending come off and as we move toward first production there in 2022, the other affiliate where we have potentially investment opportunities would be CPChem. And so that what occurs in that particular category will be a function of how decisions are made on investment [technical difficulty] for example. So it's not something that I can project with any degree of certainty. I think what\u2019s important is that the summation of both, what I would say company owned and operated an affiliate owned and operated, we\u2019re staying that $18 billion to $20 billion range for the near-term here certainly, and we will give you an update in March on prospectively longer period of time. But I think capital discipline is a theme that you want to read through all of this and the fact is that we have the opportunity to be very judicious and very selective about how we work in additional projects into our queue.\nDoug Leggate: I know it's a tough one to answer, given all the variables. My follow-up is kind of related, I guess. But if we go back to 2010, 2011, 2012, through 2014, 2015, obviously a lot of big oils, yourselves included, were spending much higher levels than you are today. And one assumes that that created a lot of cost recovery barrels in some of the PSCs. So I guess my question is to the extent you can, as we look forward in light of Thailand, how do you see your entitlement barrels trending if you maintain that CapEx at these levels? Do you start to see cost recovery barrels tail off? And if you can maybe offer some quantification of that, I would appreciate it.\nPat Yarrington: Doug, I don\u2019t think we've got numbers here that we can isolate for you on that. Cost recovery applies across the number of locations in our portfolio here. You\u2019re obviously aware of what happened in Indonesia. So, I don\u2019t think I have a pinpointed answer that I can give you on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\nDoug Terreson: Mike, I have a question about portfolio optimization and specifically the divestiture part of the plan. And on this point, you guys have had a pretty active program over the years, but you still also have a decent amount of value left in the queue. So my question is, is this because the market for assets has softened somewhat? Or do you consider it to be kind of normal course of business during the cycle or is it something else? So any color on your divestiture program and the market trends you guys are experiencing is really the question.\nMike Wirth: Yes, I'm not a 100% sure I'm tracking with you there, Doug. We have always had program of divestitures, and there were times it's a little high and times it\u2019s a little bit lower, but in this business you are continually looking to upgrade your portfolio. We have got some things now that are really attractive. And I earlier mentioned a couple of things that we stepped away from because we didn't think they would compete for capital. Divestments are driven by a view on strategic alignments with our broader portfolio and our view of the future, the resource potential that remains particular asset, will it compete for capital within our portfolio and there are good things as I mentioned earlier that cannot and then can we receive fair value. So that maybe a little bit of a function of what's the macro environment and the forward view on commodity price. But we are in a position that I think you can expect us to continue to high-grade our portfolio.\nDoug Terreson: Yes. So Mike, maybe I should have asked it differently. So it seems like you guys are experiencing healthy enough appetite for assets if you were a seller. Is that a good way to think about it?\nMike Wirth: Yes, everything we are talking to people about right now we think we are likely to receive very good value.\nOperator: Our last question for today comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.\nBiraj Borkhataria: It was actually on the reserve replacement. In 2018, you had 136%; that was a pretty impressive figure, given the growth trajectory over the last few years. I was wondering if you could just disaggregate some of the impacts there, particularly on the price impact in terms of revisions from 2017 to 2018. And then what the key kind of moving parts where. Thank you.\nMike Wirth: Yes, so, we did have another strong year, and our largest ads came through our Permian shale and tight activity through other shale and tight, and some of these other basins we've been talking about our Gorgon and Wheatstone, so primarily in the unconventional but contributions across the board from Australia, Canada, Asia, Gulf of Mexico, Eurasia. Our price was relatively small negative revision less than 100 million barrels on price. We produced just short of 1.1 billion barrels we sold about 60 million barrels. So, there was not a big price impact in there and while unconventionals were the big piece, so we had contributions from others. The one thing that I would call your attention to is what we view as very high quality reserve addition. They are barrels that have bring with them lower risk that\u2019s lower execution risk and lower geologic risks and lower breakeven prices. And so, we would expect to continue to have a good strong reserve replacement story as we go forward given the quality of our portfolio and the continued improvements that we see particularly on conventional development activities. All right, well, that is the top of the hour. I want to thank everybody for your time today. I appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call, and I look forward to see many of not all of you in New York City in March. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-11-02 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: All right. Good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pierre Breber, Executive Vice President, Downstream & Chemicals; and Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. But before I get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements and we ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Turning now to Slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $4 billion or $2.11 per diluted share. This is more than $2 billion higher than the same period a year ago and this is the highest recorded earnings per share since third quarter 2014. The company's year-to-date earnings were $11.1 billion or $5.79 per diluted share. This was $5 billion higher than the same period a year ago. The quarter included the unfavorable impacts of a project write-off, an impairment, and a nonrecurring contract settlement, which totaled $930 million. These were partially offset by a $350 million gain on the sale of our Southern African refining and marketing assets. Foreign exchange losses for the quarter were $51 million. A reconciliation of special items, foreign exchange and other non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange impacts, earnings totaled $4.7 billion or $2.44 per share. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $9.6 billion. Excluding working capital effects, cash flow from operations was $9.2 billion. Cash flow from operations continued to grow in the third quarter and was the highest it has been in nearly five years, back when Brent crude prices were averaging about $110 per barrel. Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled $21.5 billion, about $7 billion more than a year ago. At quarter-end debt balances stood at approximately $36 billion, giving us a debt ratio of 19%. During the third quarter we paid $2.1 billion in dividends and we repurchased $750 million of our shares during the quarter. We currently yield 4%. Turning to Slide 4. Our third-quarter cash flow from operations, excluding working capital effects, increased to $9.2 billion, reflecting higher realizations and growing volumes in our U.S. and international upstream. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, totaled $23.3 billion. This included $600 million in discretionary U.S. pension contributions, $800 million in deferred income taxes, and affiliate dividends approximately $2.5 billion less than equity affiliate earnings. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.6 billion and $9.8 billion year-to-date. The result, free cash flow excluding working capital effects of $5.6 billion for the quarter and $13.5 billion year-to-date. Through the first three quarters of the year, normalized for $60 Brent, we are on track to deliver the $14 billion cash generation guidance communicated at the Analyst Meeting in March. Turning now to Slide 5, a view of our sources and uses of cash through the quarter. We are delivering on all four of our financial priorities. We maintained our commitment to competitive dividend growth by paying out $2.1 billion in cash dividends to our shareholders. We continue to fund our highest return projects at a reasonable pace. We further strengthened our balance sheet and paid down debt by $2.4 billion, lowering our debt ratio to 19%. And finally, we commenced our share repurchase program in the third quarter and returned $750 million of surplus cash to shareholders. Now on Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update on our portfolio optimization efforts. Through the third quarter. We received before tax asset sale proceeds of $1.9 billion, including the divestment of our Southern African refining and marketing business. Most recently, we signed sale and purchase agreements including the sale of our 12% non-operated interest in the Danish Underground Consortium and the sale of our 40% interest in the Rosebank project west of Shetlands in the UK. In addition, we continue the process of marketing our UK Central North Sea assets. As with all divestments, we are focused on generating good value from any transaction. The progress we have made year-to-date on portfolio optimization puts us on track to generate $5 billion to $10 billion in asset sale proceeds over the 2018 to 2020 time period as we guided back in March. Turning to Slide 7, third quarter 2018 after tax earnings $4 billion were approximately two times that of third quarter 2017. Special Items reduced earnings by approximately $1 billion between periods. In the current period, special items included a gain on the sale of South African R&M assets. The write-off of the Tigris project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, an impairment on an asset held for sale, and a non-recurring contractual settlement. All of which netted to a negative $580 million. In third quarter 2017, special items included a gain on the sale of Canadian R&M assets, less project write-offs, for a net positive impact of $455 million. Foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by $61 million between periods. Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by almost $3.5 billion between the periods or about five times, mainly on improved realizations and higher liftings. Oil prices were approximately 45% higher in the current period than a year ago. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by about $100 million. This reflected lower margins in Asia and in the U.S., along with foregone contributions from our Canadian downstream assets which were sold. Favorable timing effects and higher earnings from CPChem were partially offsetting. The variance in the other segment was primarily the result of higher corporate tax items and interest expense. Turning to Slide 8, this compares results for third quarter 2018 with second quarter 2018. Third quarter results were approximately $600 million higher than second quarter. Third quarter special items as detailed previously, when compared to second quarter's non-recurring receivable write-down, resulted in a net negative variance between the quarters of $310 million. Of about equal size was an adverse swing in foreign exchange impacts between the periods. Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $1 billion between the quarters due to higher liftings and improved realizations. During the quarter we were in an overlifted position but on a year-to-date basis we are modestly underlifted. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange improved by almost $240 million, reflecting lower operating expenses, particularly those associated with the second quarter turnaround at the Pascagoula Refinery. Favorable timing effects were also evident between periods. Turning to Slide 9, third quarter production was 2.96 million barrels a day, our highest ever production for a quarter. This moved our year-to-date production to 2.88 million barrels a day. Excluding the impact of 2018 asset sales, which is the middle bar, our year-to-date production growth through the third quarter was 6%higher than the daily average production for full year 2017. As Jay mentioned on our last quarter call, we had planned turnaround activity across multiple locations in the third quarter. The production impact from these turnarounds was 103,000 barrels per day. 2018 asset sales impacted third quarter production by 18,000 barrels a day and impacted year-to-date production by 12,000 barrels per day. At year end we expect to be at the top of our original guidance range, approximately 7% growth excluding the impact of asset sales. And this is even without normalizing for the impact of current prices on production sharing contracts. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter 2018 production was 2.96 million barrels per day, an increase of 239,000 barrels a day, or 9% from third quarter 2017. Major capital projects increased production by 237,000 barrels per day, as we continued to ramp up multiple projects, most significantly Wheatstone, Gorgon and Hebron. Shale and tight production increased 155,000 barrels per day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, where production grew by 80% from a year ago. Base declines, net of production from new wells, such as those in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria were 6,000 barrels a day. Major turnarounds, along with planned and unplanned downtime reduced production by 59,000 barrels per day between the periods. Entitlement effects reduced production by 41,000 barrels a day due primarily to rising prices between the periods. The impact of 2017 and 2018 asset sales reduced production by 31,000 barrels a day between the periods. Now on Slide 11, Gorgon and Wheatstone continued to operate very well. Combined, these plants averaged 379,000 barrels a day of production during the quarter. This is a 35% increase over the previous quarter. We had two planned maintenance activities on Wheatstone during the quarter, a scheduled compressor overhaul on Train 1 and a startup strainer removal on Train 2. These reduced production by approximately 21,000 barrels a day on average over the quarter. We are finalizing the commissioning of the Wheatstone domestic gas plant and expect first sales in first quarter 2019. For this gas, production and sales activity will be dependent on local demand. With all five Australian LNG trains running reliably, we're focusing on finding opportunities to incrementally add production and enhance reliability. Turning to the Permian, on Slide 12, Permian shale and tight production in the second quarter was 338,000 barrels per day, representing an increase of 150,000 barrels per day. Let me say it again, this is up 80% relative to the same quarter last year. As many of you will realize, that's the equivalent of adding a mid-sized Permian pure play E&P company in a matter of months. In our operated Permian acreage, where we hold 100% of the working interest, we had an average of 20 rigs in operation during the quarter. We also had 21 non-operated rigs working on our acreage, which equates to approximately 7 net rigs, Chevron's share. As Jay discussed on the last earnings call, we remain focused on returns, capital efficiency and operational discipline. Within this framework our production levels are trending about one year ahead of the guidance we gave in March. I'll now pass it on to Pierre, who can give an update on our downstream and chemicals business.\nPierre R. Breber: Thanks. Pat. We have a tightly integrated and profitable downstream and chemicals business. Slide 13 shows that Chevron's downstream has consistently led our peer group in earnings per barrel. And during the past five years our adjusted return on capital employed has averaged over 15%. Our fuels businesses are focused in the best markets in the U.S. and Asia. In petrochemicals, we are feedstock advantaged, heavily weighted to ethane. And we are the only major integrated with wholly owned lubricants and additives businesses. Looking forward, our objective is to grow earnings across our feedstock to customer value chains and target investments to lead the industry in returns. Now let me address IMO 2020. As a reminder, new International Maritime Organization regulations will reduce the sulfur emissions from bunker fuels starting in 2020. Although there are a lot of unknowns and uncertainties with how markets will react, most agree that complex refiners should benefit, as demand increases for marine gas oil. Slide 14 shows that Chevron's refining network has the highest complexity and the highest percentage of conversion capacity among its peer group. It is a result of high-grading our refinery portfolio over the years and investing in upgrading capability. Forward markets expect mid-distillate margins to increase post-IMO and high sulfur fuel oil and sour crude discounts to widen. Chevron's refining network produces over 40% mid-distillates and about 5% fuel oil. And as a complex refiner, we run a high proportion of heavy sour crudes. We believe we're well positioned to benefit from IMO impacts. We like the petrochemicals business and have highly competitive 50-50 joint ventures in ChevronPhillips Chemical Company and GS Caltex. Slide 15 shows our major chemical projects in various stages of development. CPChem successfully started up its Gulf Coast project after a remarkable recovery from Hurricane Harvey. The ethylene plant reached full production rates two weeks after a March start up and exceeded nameplate capacity soon after. CPChem is focused on additional de-bottlenecking opportunities. Following its success with this project, CPChem is in the evaluation stage of a second one in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We like the Gulf Coast because of its feedstock advantages and expect competitive ethane supply for a long time. We are focused on developing the most capital and cost efficient project, one that is on the left side of the supply stack. GSC is in front end engineering and design for a mixed feed olefins cracker, about two-thirds naphtha and the rest refinery LPGs and off-gases. We plan to make a final investment decision next year. Estimated costs are not final, but we expect our share of the capital to be a little more than $1 billion. The fundamentals of chemicals are strong, but costs always matter. We'll continue to be disciplined in how we invest in our next set of chemical projects. In our fuels businesses, retail is an important part of a tightly integrated value chain that starts with our complex refineries. Two recent retail highlights are shown on Slide 16. In Mexico, we have about 100 Chevron-branded marketer-owned sites. Customer response has been very positive. Stations rebranded during the first half of 2018 averaged 30% higher sales through September. We've also signed access agreements for two new terminals under development. After the terminals are complete, we will have built, in a capital-light way, an additional market to integrate with our West Coast value chain. We continue to grow our convenience store offering with now over 800 stores. As the only major with a leading C-store franchise in the U.S., we have an advantage in retaining and growing our relationships with retailers. Same-store sales at ExtraMile C-stores have grown 7.4% year-to-date, more than double the industry average. In the digital space, we made announcements on new mobile pay partnerships in the U.S. and went live with a pay app in Southeast Asia. These are important efforts to speed up and simplify the fuels retailing experience. In our Oronite additives business, we celebrated the groundbreaking for our blending and shipping project in China. This facility will help us serve the growing Chinese market when it's operational in 2021. Finally, in our lubricants business we are co-developing a renewable biodegradable base oil with ultra low viscosity and ultra low volatility, important properties for OEMs as they develop engines to meet increasingly stringent fuel efficiency and environmental regulations. It's early days, but we're excited by the potential of this new product. As shown earlier, Chevron's downstream and chemicals has a track record of consistent financial performance. That said, in any one quarter refinery planned turnarounds impact our results. Through our recent investor engagements, we've heard your requests for improved guidance in this area. Slide 17 shows the average after-tax quarterly earnings impact of planned turnaround activity for the last five years for our refineries in the U.S. and Asia. The impact is defined as shutdown expenses, plus the forgone margin from volumes not produced. Planned turnarounds are seasonal, but have a fair amount of variability in any given quarter. As a result, we believe that the best way to provide forward-looking guidance is by characterizing turnaround activity as high if the earnings impact is expected to be greater than $200 million; low if it's expected to be below $100 million; and medium in between. During 2018 the first two quarters had high turnaround activity and the third quarter was low. Now I'll turn it over to Pat to close out with fourth quarter guidance and year-to-date results.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. So now looking at Slide 18 just a couple of comments about expectations for the remainder of the year we expect positive production trends to continue in the fourth quarter fueled by sustained Permian growth and fewer planned upstream turnarounds. Downstream in contrast has a high turnaround activity planned and this is expected to weigh on this segment's fourth quarter earnings and cash flow. For C&E, you'll recall that we don't budget for unanticipated inorganic spend. Through the first nine months, we have spent approximately $150 million on inorganic C&E and we expect to spend a total of $600 million for the full-year, primarily as the result of six blocks won in the Brazil licensing round. Organic C&E is running modestly above our plan and we expect it to be approximately 5% higher than our full-year budget of $18.3 billion. Cash flow from operations is expected to be strong in the fourth quarter. Oil prices of course will be the primary determinant of this outcome and we can't predict those. While we do anticipate fewer affiliate dividends in the fourth quarter, we'll continue to benefit from further production growth, modest asset sale proceeds and some expected additional release of working capital. Lastly, let's revisit our year-to-date results and how they compare against commitments that we laid out earlier in the year. Cash flow from operations is expanding as anticipated given our strong production growth, favorable market conditions and asset reliability. Excluding the impact of asset sales, production growth is currently at 6% relative to full-year 2017 and we expect to end the year closer to a 7% year-on-year increase. Our Permian assets are performing well ahead of guidance. We continue to rationalize and optimize our portfolio, with proceeds of $1.9 billion captured year-to-date. We're demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline and are returning cash to our shareholders. Total shareholder distributions have amounted to $7.2 billion year-to-date, $6.4 billion in dividends and $750 million in share repurchases. We've had a very solid operating and financial performance so far in 2018 and we expect that performance to continue. We're seeing significant growth in cash generation due to the above plan production growth, continuing capital and operating expense discipline and favorable market conditions. As a result, we've been able to grow shareholder distributions and strengthen our balance sheet. We believe that Chevron offers a very attractive offering for investors with oil price levered momentum in the up cycle and low cost portfolio resilience in the down cycle. So that concludes our prepared remarks and we're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue and so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll certainly do our best to get all your questions answered. Jonathan, please go ahead and open the line.\nOperator: Certainly. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.\nJason Gammel: Thank you very much. I guess first turn to the Permian. Obviously very strong operational performance there in 3Q. And while I certainly wouldn't prorate the growth that you saw there moving forward, I was hoping you might be able to address some of the factors that led to such strong production growth.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, Jason, thanks. I think, first of all we have been ramping up to the 20 rigs throughout the last couple of years and we achieved that 20 rig potential or realization here in the third quarter so that was the primary determinant. We are operating off of a new basis of design and we're finding that that has been incredibly successful. We're pursuing high density fracs and we're finding that that has been successful as well. So there's a number of factors that have led to the overall improvement that we have seen and I would say too, our NOJV partners, because prices have been stronger, perhaps than they were thinking at the beginning of the year, the NOJV activity has risen as well.\nJason Gammel: That's great. And maybe to take advantage of Pierre being on the call. Pierre, we've had the discussion before about your downstream business being very high return and very high margin but relatively small compared to your competitors. I believe you've been quoted as saying that you may be interested in expanding your refining presence on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Can you, if that's correct, maybe talk about some of the strategic drivers for wanting to expand there?\nPierre R. Breber: Thanks, Jason. Look, I won't comment on media reports or speculation but what I can say is I have for almost as long as I've been on the job now, over two years, talked about the strategic rationale of a Gulf Coast refinery, for three primary reasons. One, we're the only major company that operates one refinery in the Gulf Coast. Second is, we have a strong retail presence in Texas that we supply with third party barrels. And third is the possible integration and synergies with our advantaged position that Pat just talked about in the Permian. At the same time, I've also said we don't need to do anything. Pascagoula is a top quartile refinery. We have a tight value chain built around it. And I've also said we're value-oriented. Any acquisition has to be at the right price. Any investment that we do has to earn attractive returns. And so, I think that's all I can really say at this time.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Jason.\nJason Gammel: Okay. Appreciate the comments.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nNeil Mehta: Hey congrats, guys on a good quarter. Pat and Pierre, I want to get your thoughts on divestitures. You laid out a $5 billion to $10 billion target. You're about $2 billion of the way there, just how do you feel about the ability to achieve that? Where do you think you guys are going to fall in the range and just any updates on deal \u2013 on processes that might be outstanding.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, I would say, overall, Neil, we feel positive about coming in within the range that we've indicated, the $5 billion to $10 billion over the three-year period of time. We're at $2 billion a little bit and change so far. There is a little bit more that will come in we believe in the fourth quarter. And then we have certain, I guess, I would say marketing activities that are underway already that should, we believe, realize results in 2019. So we feel comfortable about the $5 billion to $10 billion range. The assets \u2013 we're finding for those that are being marketed for example in the U.K. we're having reasonable interest. Actually, I'd say probably significant interest being shown by multiple potential buyers. So I think we feel very good about that range that we've given.\nNeil Mehta: That's great. And then when we talk to investors about \u2013 who are a little bit more skeptical of the bullish view on Chevron, they point to two things. I want you guys to address it head-on. And one is the concern that post-2020, capital spending might need to materially increase because you're in a period of harvest right now, but you might not have the projects to reload growth post-2020. The second source of concern is around production sharing contracts in Asia and the risk of them rolling off, particularly in Thailand, less so of a concern around Indonesia but anything you can say on both of those topics to help comfort the market would be helpful.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. Well, let me just speak here to the issue around growth once we get into the early part of the next decade and investment opportunities therein. We obviously have a wonderful position in the Permian and with other unconventionals. And as you know, these are low capital intensity, short cycle high-return opportunities for continued volumetric growth. So that's number one. We've got TCO coming online with production in 2022. We have opportunities for de-bottlenecking on our LNG plants in Australia. We're just getting them to a fully run rate, high-reliability position now and we think the opportunity for reasonable de-bottlenecking is evident over the next several years. We have growth potential in deepwater. We have three potential areas in Gulf of Mexico; Ballymore, Whale and Anchor. And I think that's where people are thinking there will be substantial capital. And the reality is our objective is to pace those out over a several year period of time. And there's nothing in terms of the intensity on future investment there that would ever come close to the intensity that we've had in prior years which is where I think people's \u2013 they're thinking the history is going to color our future and that's really not the case. So I think we have growth potential, but it's going to be at a much lower capital rate. There may be some need to increase capital coming in say, 2021, 2022, that kind of range. But it will be small relative to where people might be thinking. Now I've taken so long on that; what was the other question that you had? Oh, the concession extension?\nNeil Mehta: Yeah. Concession. Yeah.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes. Okay. So I think it's \u2013 I'm really glad you asked the question because there's been a lot written on this and it's a good opportunity to try to work through the specifics. So if you look at our particular situation \u2013 and by the way, we put concession extension information, our expiration information in our stat supplement. So I really encourage people to look at those documents and get a good understanding of what is coming due when. But if you look out over the next three to four years, we've got about six contracts that will expire. We have one that is in a non-producing area, this is the Nsoko contract in Congo which expires in 2018 here. In Indonesia, we have the East Kalimantan PSC that expired just about 10 days ago or so. And the Makassar Strait PSC is going to expire in 2020. And we have a small NOJV PSC in China which is going to expire in 2022. So there are a couple of others that have more substance to us. All of those are relatively immaterial and not substantive. There are a couple that do have impacts for us and one would be the Rokan PSC in Indonesia and this has gotten a lot of press lately. We did bid on this, but we were not the successful bidder. The government of Indonesia elected to return this asset to Pertamina and this will expire in 2021. We're disappointed in that but we did put in a bid that we felt offered value to the government of Indonesia, as well as to the Chevron shareholder. Our net production in Indonesia today is about 100,000 barrels a day. But the earnings and cash contribution out of that is much smaller than that would indicate as a percentage of the upstream portfolio. And then the other contract of note, concession area is the Erawan PSC in Thailand and this expires in 2022. I can't say a great deal about this at this particular moment, but we have put in a bid that is under evaluation. We are taking the same approach that we did in Indonesia, which is to put in a bid that we feel offers value for Indonesia but also offers value for the Chevron shareholder.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Thanks, good morning. First question, I guess...\nWayne Borduin: Good morning.\nPhilip M. Gresh: ...would just be a follow-up on the Permian, given your success that you're seeing there and that you hit your rig count targets for the end of the year. How are you thinking about the go-forward plans here? You talked previously about leveling off with the rig count at this point. But given the success you're seeing, does this make you want to kind of lean forward and add rigs in the Permian? Or how are you thinking about that today?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: So I think we feel good about having gotten to the 20 rigs. And our approach right now would be to take a bit of a pause and to really focus on capturing all the efficiencies that we can that a 20 rig fleet would necessitate basically. And that's from the land position to the drillings to the completions, all the way through to the market realization. So our approach right now is to take a pause, gain all that efficiency. We're really focused on the returns that we're getting from the investment that we're making. And we want to make sure that we're as capital efficient and as operating efficient as we can possibly be. And then we can always reappraise and look at our options and decide what we would like to do going forward. I will say that it's not so much about the actual rig \u2013 number of rigs that you have drilling, but it's the activity that's being generated and the results that you're getting and the cost per BOE that you're getting. And so I think over time we're going to try to move what we consider to be a critical performance metric away from just the rigs to something that would be more indicative of an efficiency measure.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Yeah. Got it. That makes sense. Second question is just on the balance sheet metrics, 19% gross debt to cap, but 15% net debt to cap, so you're trending quite well on the balance sheet. How do you think about the desire to \u2013 given where we're at in the cycle, to continue to lower that metric versus other opportunities? You obviously started with the buyback last quarter of $3 billion. Is there any desire to potentially at some stage in the future increase that amount? Or given \u2013 do you have a more kind of conservative macro view, and you'd rather stick with where you're at?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, I think \u2013 so it's a wonderful question and it's a great position to be in, Phil. We have only three months into the share repurchase program. We obviously feel very comfortable and good about the cash generation that is occurring in the company. And we also know that we've got a confirmed $18 billion to $20 billion capital program. So if we are in a position where we continue to see high cash generation, the market continues to give \u2013 to be at prices at current levels or approximately current levels, and we know our confirmed spending, then there's going to be surplus cash that is being generated. And if those circumstances all materialize, then we would obviously give consideration to the size of the share repurchase program. We will want the same kind of parameters that I outlined back in the last quarter to be evident. In other words, we want to make sure that whatever we do, we can have it be sustainable and that it's a reliable component available to our shareholders. I will say in that regard, the improvement to the balance sheet supports that sustainability. Because to the extent that we have a stronger balance sheet, then when we get into a downturn on price, and we believe that at some point in time that will come. When we get into that position, then we've got a balance sheet that can help support distributions to shareholders through the thin part of the cycle.\nPhilip M. Gresh: Sure. Okay, thanks a lot.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, Pat, I'm afraid I'm probably the guy responsible for all these PSC questions, so I apologize. But I do want to follow up on the question from earlier if I may. Thailand is a legacy tax concession. And it's been re-bid as a PSC. The government has been quite transparent about the minimum terms. So I just wonder if you could address one issue. If you look at third-party analysis on this, meaning tax \u2013 very old tax framework information, this thing could be as much as $2 billion of your cash flow this year. Is that anywhere close to being right? And if so, under the new terms, how would you expect the delta on cash flow to look, even though that you might retain the contract from a production standpoint?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, Doug, you're putting me in an uncomfortable position. I really can't comment while commercial discussions are underway and bids have been put forth and are being evaluated. I think we're going to have to wait and see what the outcome is from the discussions and the \u2013 whatever gets awarded. I think by the end of this year is sort of the planned date for understanding what the outcome will be. We'll have to give you an indication then of what the results will be. I can confirm that the bidding package does contain tougher fiscal terms. So I think you can build that into your expectations. But exactly what the degree will be, I'm not at liberty to say at this point.\nDoug Leggate: I certainly did not mean to put you in an awkward spot, but thanks for trying to answer it. My follow-up is hopefully a bit more constructive and it's on the Permian. So you're saying \u2013 in your prepared remarks you said you're running about a year ahead of schedule. So with the change in design and obviously the improvement we expect next year, at least in Permian spreads, differentials and so on, would you expect to basically maintain the same plateau target? Or given that you're running so far ahead, would you expect to see further upside risks to your production outlook? In other words, will you do more with less? Or maintain the same \u2013 or continue the same growth trajectory and take what it gives you with the same level of activity if you know what I mean?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, I mean, I think we're really constructive on the Permian. And just some things to keep in mind, right. We've been ramping up to the 20 rig rate. We're now going to have 20 rigs for the full calendar year, once you go into 2019. So that will be a positive. We're seeing continued benefits coming from our new basis of design and continuing improvements in efficiencies as we move along. So we think that there's upside potential here as we continue to fine-tune our well placement; fine-tune really the entire I guess I would say value chain associated with the Permian. So, I think we're constructive on the Permian. And we'll certainly give you an update at our March in 2019 SAM, which we've done for several years now running. But I think it's a positive outlook that we feel for that asset.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks for taking my questions, Pat. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question please.\nPaul Sankey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Pierre \u2013 hi, Pat. Pierre, since you're especially on the line, I thought we'd go back to your IMO comments. There's been some recent press that the potential is for the market impact to be too severe for perhaps the administration to handle. I would imagine that would have to be on the gasoline price. Can you talk a little bit more \u2013 U.S. gasoline price for that matter, can you talk a little bit more about how you think the effect of IMO will play out? And to be specific, do you think there will be a major impact on U.S. gasoline prices as opposed to distillate? And one other thing I would ask is that, as regards fuel oil where do you expect the unused residual to end up and how will that clear the market given the transport difficulties there? Thanks.\nPierre R. Breber: Okay. Thanks, Paul. Well, let's see. There are a lot of unknowns and uncertainties around how IMO is going to roll through the system. I think part of the challenge is that IMO is not in a vacuum, right. You can't hold everything else constant and think of IMO because it will be happening in 2020 when there will be other supply and demand factors happening. What's the economy doing at that point in time? What are sour crudes global production happening? So there are a lot of moving parts that are going on. But what you can step back and say and one of my comments sort of alluded to, if you look at the forward markets right now is you would see mid-distillates, diesel, gen diesel, crack spreads increasing post-2020. And you'll see HSFO or high-sulfur fuel oil and sour crudes discounts widening. And that makes sense, right? As you point out, there is a lot of fuel that goes to the bunker market. The expectation is that there's not enough scrubbers that have been put in place to consume all the high-sulfur fuel oil. So they are going to look to alternatives and those alternatives will be marine gas oil that will look like distillate. And/or it could be a low-sulfur fuel oil and there's a lot that's going on in that space. So in terms of MO gas, it's a difficult thing to predict, because there's so many factors. I think one thing I would say is that the underlying \u2013 we've seen crude move plus or minus $10 in a few weeks the last couple months. Those movements are much bigger movements on gasoline pricing or any product pricing. We're really talking just about differentials. And MO gas can really \u2013 you can see it going either way. It could get pulled up if some of the intermediates that are used for MO gas go to make distillates. You could also make arguments that it could weaken a little bit if runs are higher and there's excess MO gas. So it's really something that I can't predict. What we're focused on is being prepared for it, minimizing high-sulfur fuel oil production in our refineries by making small-scale modifications. We are seeing scrubber uptake increase for ship owners. We are looking to sell what we do produce to them. We're looking at alternative markets that are non-marine, like power generation, asphalt, folks, who have excess upgrading capability. And we're confident that we're prepared for IMO. We're also working on testing low-sulfur fuel oils, so different marine fuels, lubricants and additives and we're a leader in marine lubricants and additives. They are going to be a big part of the solution, so we're testing and developing new products for that. So there's a lot of work underway. We got a little more than a year to go and we'll be ready for it.\nPaul Sankey: Pierre, I feel like I'm not the first guy to have asked that question. Can you just give us any sense for the power generation market and your expectation of scrubbing penetration? Thanks.\nPierre R. Breber: Well, again on scrubbing penetration, our view if you step back, the most economic way to comply with the IMO regulations is for ship owners to put in scrubbers, right. That's a much more cost-effective mechanism than investing capital. And we're not \u2013 or for refineries to invest capital. We're not looking to make any investments that \u2013 large-scale investments that are IMO-related. It's because we view it as transient. One thing about our markets is they work. And when arbs open up, they get closed. There's lots of players. There's lots of capital. And there are lots of people who are working to reduce arbs. So our view is that \u2013 sorry, I lost the track on that a bit.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Power.\nPierre R. Breber: Oh, on power generation, I'm sorry. Yes, on power generation there's a pretty good-sized market in the Middle East and other places. Again, it's not the \u2013 it's a lower-value market clearly. But our view is it's likely to require some power generation market to go through the transition. But again, over time, we expect scrubber uptake to increase and that will be the primary mechanism of complying with IMO.\nPaul Sankey: Pierre, thanks. I'll let someone else have a go. Thank you.\nPierre R. Breber: Thanks, Paul.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Hey guys, good morning.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Pierre, since you are here, so two questions for you; one really short. Your refining system, can you tell us what percentage you run as heavy oil, those we define as over \u2013 below 25 API? And how much is the medium sour you run, those we define between 25 to 30, 31 API? And the second question is that given your position that when you're looking to support your upstream, will you be involved or that think you need to be involved in terms of helping to ensure we have sufficient Gulf Coast oil export capacity because you may have some concern by late 2019 or early 2020 where you may have a gap. Or that you think that it's so transitionary that it's not really a concern and you guys don't need to be as an equity owner in those? And also then if you can comment on Duvernay, that it seems like we also have infrastructure issue. And that will \u2013 given your position and you're doing some pilot project and all that, is that something that you guys will involve? Or need to be involved I guess the question is.\nPierre R. Breber: Okay. Let me see. Let me take the first one at least. We do not disclose specific sour content or API gravity. What we do disclose in our Annual Report Supplement is the region or country of origin of the crudes. And I think folks can figure it out from there. Again, I showed a chart that showed that we're the \u2013 have the highest Nelson Complexity, the highest amount of upgrading capacity. I mean, we are designed to run lower-value feedstocks and we've invested to make that happen but we don't disclose specifics on that. On your second question, on how we think about the upstream in the Permian, I guess, I would say the downstream is \u2013 has to stand on its own. Any investment we do has to stand on its own. We're competing as a segment. We're \u2013 I showed charts that showed how we are in earnings per barrel versus our major competitors. And so we have to look at that way. Now we're part of an enterprise; and if we can have synergies with the upstream, of course, that's an added benefit. But investments in the downstream can't ride on the back of, in particular, very attractive economics in the Permian. Again, we have to have investments that stand on their own merit that compete against our competitors. Any extra benefit from synergies is upside on that. On the third question, I think it was around takeaway and I'll leave that with Pat.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. I mean, I was just going to add, I think you had a question about export capacity. And I think our corporate view would be yes, there may be a little bit of a need to build out export capacity over the next two or three years. But kind of going back to the belief that markets see this opportunity and that that capacity will be in fact built out, we don't see it as a risk to flow assurance. We have ourselves dedicated export capacity of about 25,000 barrels a day now. We see that expanding in the early part of next year to about 80,000 barrels a day. So far we've exported about 8 million barrels, I believe is the number. So we feel that we're investing appropriately for our flow. But we don't think in general over time that there will be a risk to flow assurance in the Permian because of export capacity.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Pat, is that the same apply to in the Duvernay area in Canada, that you don't believe that you need to involve on the build-out of the infrastructure there?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: In Canada?\nWayne Borduin: Your question is in reference to the oil sands, Paul?\nPaul Y. Cheng: No, to the Duvernay?\nWayne Borduin: Oh, Duvernay.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Duvernay? Yeah, I guess I don't have any particular insights associated with Duvernay.\nWayne Borduin: Yeah, I think I would just chime in. Pat, I think we have previously disclosed that we...\nPatricia E. Yarrington: (00:49:07).\nWayne Borduin: ...a while ago we committed to the Pembina infrastructure agreement that is well-paired to enable our production out of the Duvernay. And you'd expect that as we continue to progress that development there that we would be able to step into additional capacity agreements to enable that flow.\nPaul Y. Cheng: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Simmons & Company. Your question please.\nBlake Fernandez: Hi, folks. Good morning. Pat, a question for you on CapEx, it looks like you're trending about 5% above. Could you talk a little bit about what the drivers are there, whether it's activity or inflationary based? And should we be thinking about that kind of giving upward momentum into the next couple of years as well? So maybe like toward the upper end of your range?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. So, good question, Blake. Yeah, we're about $600 million on a year-to-date basis. We're about $600 million above plan if plan were ratable there. And about $150 million of this or so relates to inorganic, lease acquisitions, bonus lease payments that we have made. And as I said in my prepared remarks we expect that number to go to about $600 million by the time we get to the full year. But back to the nine months, that means we're about $450 million over on an organic basis, and there's really several reasons for this. It's not concentrated in any one particular area. The first thing I would call out is, just the fact that oil prices have been noticeably higher in 2018 than the planning premise that we use when we put the budget together. So there has been some cost savings. There were cost savings that we had built into our plan that we thought we would be able to capture from a capital standpoint. And we really haven't been able to capture those. Because the cost trends stopped going down; and in fact they leveled out, and in fact have turned the other direction along with oil price. So there's a piece of the overrun that relates to that. There is a piece that relates to major capital projects. Jay mentioned TCO on the last call, but there's other projects as well that I could throw in there with small overruns. And then, there's also more that's being spent in the Permian and again, we've talked about the drilling efficiencies, a new basis of design, the fact that we're able to prosecute the development plan against more acreage than we had originally envisioned. And with the high density fracs, they cost more, but in fact, the economic outcomes are really outstanding. And so the dollar per barrel per EUR is much better. So that's money \u2013 that's good money being spent. So those are the reasons that I would outline for the overrun that we have so far. In terms of pressures, inflationary pressures, I will say, we are continuing to see inflationary pressures, for example, in the Permian. And we do expect increases there, maybe in the order of 5% to 10% in the 2019 period. In general, because oil prices have been sustained higher, I think that the cost structure in the industry has moved up some. So I would say, yes, we are facing that and that would be something that would be reasonable to build into your expectations.\nBlake Fernandez: That is helpful. Thank you very much. The second question, I hope you didn't necessarily kind of cover this in exact detail on Paul's question, but mine was on the Permian takeaway. I think in last quarter's call you had kind of highlighted excess capacity through June and then ample takeaway for non-operated production through 2019. I'm just curious with the massive ramp-up that we're seeing here, are you still pretty well taken care of from a takeaway capacity through that same timeframe and say throughout next year?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yes, we are. Absolutely. I mean the whole process that we have, whether it be for crude or NGL transportation or fractionation, the whole setup that we've got is trying to stay ahead of what we expect the Permian growth to be. And so we do this through securing from \u2013 in increment, contractual offtake. So we feel very nicely covered for our position out of the Midland on those elements for the next couple of years. And of course, the team that we have working this will be working for the three year period and the four year period. I mean, it's a perpetual step-up that we are trying to orchestrate here.\nBlake Fernandez: That's great. Thank you.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Blake.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please.\nAlastair R. Syme: Hi. Pat, can I just ask what makes Tigris different to Ballymore, Whale, and Anchor?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: I think it really comes down to the \u2013 it fundamentally comes down to the economics that we anticipate out of those individual developments. So you're influenced by the size of the resource, the demands as to whether that needs to be an independent topsides or whether it's got tieback opportunity, the complexity of the reservoir. I mean, there's a whole number of factors that go into account. And Tigris had its own complexity, because it was a three-field aggregated development. So you shouldn't read in to the fact that we decided to exit the Tigris leases, you shouldn't read in anything there about our dedication to the deepwater. We are still dedicated to the deepwater. We think we have expertise in the deepwater. We picked up a significant number of leases in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater as well as offshore Mexico and Brazil as well. So we're still invested in the deepwater. And we're just looking for the highest return projects. It's all about making choices and going after what we believe will be the best opportunity to secure high returns in our portfolio.\nAlastair R. Syme: Thank you. Can I \u2013 as a follow-up, can I just return to the discussion around PSCs and just clarify for the sake of the guidance that you put in the SAM around cash returns out to 2020. What sort of assumptions are made around contract renewal?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Right. I mean, on the two important ones that I talked about for both Rokan and Erawan, both of the assumptions in the materials that we provided back in March were that those concessions were extended. In terms of the concession extension dates though, I think that's important. Both of those are 2021, 2022. So for the next several years we still have those available to us.\nAlastair R. Syme: Thanks for the clarification.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay. And I'd just say, and we can still, because we've seen such strong growth in the unconventional, even without those concession extensions, our \u2013 we can still see growth in our base plus shale and tight.\nAlastair R. Syme: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nRoger D. Read: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I guess could we follow up a little bit your comments on the cost inflation on the CapEx side, specifically any update on TCO relative to where we were? And then, how these cost inflation issues or CapEx overruns affect the overall spending budget or run the risk of? And then as you're starting to think about where projects are going to bid out for 2019, is that already being incorporated in expectations?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, Roger, thanks for the question. First, let me let me just reiterate, staying within the $18 billion to $20 billion range is our focus here. And that comes with any sort of adjustment that needs to be made, whether it's on the major capital project side or it's on the inflationary side. We're making choices. And our choice is to stay within that $18 billion to $20 billion range. And we think it's very doable, because we've got lined out activity over the next couple of years. To TCO in particular, let me just make a few comments about that, because I did happen to visit the plant about 10 days or so ago with both Wayne and Jay Johnson. And so I do have a firsthand view of what's going on there. And just making a couple of personal observations here, got to start with the fact though, that we're only 2.5 years in and we still got 3.5 years to go. First oil is still scheduled for 2022. So we're only about 50% of the way through on all this. And I would say from my observation, a number of things are going quite well in the project. It's a big complex project. It's been broken down into individual, five individual work streams and those individual work streams have gotten lined out, kind of what I'll call productivity packages, work packages, where daily/weekly/monthly they've got identified activity that's being done and they're tracking their progress daily. And so we are seeing site productivity improve tremendously. I think Jay mentioned on the second quarter call, that 2019 \u2013 the rest of 2018 and 2019 are the really critical execution years. We're moving away from being out of the civils and undergrounds into the MEI phase. And so, 2019 will be an absolutely critical year from an execution standpoint. So I'm really \u2013 I was really impressed with the productivity gains that we're seeing. And of course, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. I don't want to get too far out over my skis or overstate anything here, but things are working well. The logistics are working well, the modules are being delivered. It's being lined out and proceeding quite nicely.\nRoger D. Read: That's fair. I think given the performance of the quarter we won't try to put you on the rack or stretch you right here.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: (00:59:31). I appreciate that.\nRoger D. Read: The follow-up question, as we think about the outperformance in the Permian this quarter, and I mean, it's been building for a while, just really spiked up here. Between the operated and the non-operated and thinking about your comments on the high density fracs and so forth, is \u2013 should we think about the outperformance being overwhelmingly within Chevron operated rigs, or spread out? In other words, you're \u2013 what you're learning in your own wells is being applied even to the non-op. I'm just \u2013 as we think about a change in rig percentages operated versus non-operated, whether or not that would affect growth going forward?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah. So I would say in the quarter, the contribution in terms of absolute production between operated and non-operated was about the same. We had been building up activity, rig activity, as well as the non-ops had too. But of course, the non-ops had kind of rig activity that had started \u2013 production activity that started several years previously. So I feel, as though the contributions in the quarter are relatively comparable between non-op and co-op. Both areas are seeing improvement.\nRoger D. Read: All right. Great. Thank you.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Roger.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\nSam Margolin: Good morning. I'm sorry, it's late stage in the call. I sort of have a thematic question, but I'll try to keep it concise. You made a reference to fiscal terms kind of tightening or escalating in Thailand. That might be happening in other places too and at the same time, even with cost inflation in the Permian accounted for, sort of effectively the opposite is happening, where you're getting more efficient and economics are improving. So I guess, my question is just broadly, how do you manage that? In the past you've kind of set a level of where you think unconventional production could be within your portfolio, but if the economics on a relative basis are getting so much better than they are everywhere else, what's the process of kind of managing your mix here to make sure that you're optimized when things on the screen seem to incent you to go wildly in one direction?\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Yeah, yeah. Sam, I would just say, we have a fundamental belief in the value of diversification and having a diversified portfolio. And we have several legacy assets whether you think of Australia or unconventional in the Permian, TCO, deepwater. We have several significant asset classes that we want to continue to pursue. And you're right, in some locations around the world, you see a tightening of fiscal terms, but in other locations around the world you see the fact that the host governments are realizing that in order to incent foreign investment they need to revise the fiscal terms in a more kind of favorable to the investor, like a Chevron would be situation. So it ebbs and flows and we're in the business for the long term. And so we just \u2013 we continue to assess our portfolio and try to make the best decisions we can make not only for a short term, but also for long term; production growth, reserve replacement, cash flow growth, dividend growth, et cetera. So it's a \u2013 we look at it as a portfolio.\nSam Margolin: All right. Thanks so much for all the color on a long call.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, thank you.\nPierre R. Breber: Thank you.\nPatricia E. Yarrington: Okay, I guess that was our last call. So I want to thank everybody for your time today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and we appreciate everyone's participation on the call. Have a good day. Jonathan, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-07-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPat Yarrington: Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are, Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream and Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's Web site. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Turning to Slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s second quarter earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.78 per diluted share. This is nearly $2 billion or roughly a $1 per share higher than the same period a year ago. The quarter included the impact of a non-recurring receivable write-down, which was offset by foreign exchange gains. A reconciliation of special items, foreign exchange and other non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $6.9 billion. Excluding working capital effect, cash flow from operations was $7 billion. The working capital penalty in the current quarter was understated by the $270 million receivable write-down as just mentioned as this was a non-cash item. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations has totaled $11.9 billion, about $3 billion more than a year ago. At quarter end, debt balances stood at approximately $39 billion, giving us a headline debt ratio of 20% and a net debt ratio of 17%. During the second quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends and we currently yield 3.6%. Turning to Slide 4. In addition to the non-cash receivable write-down impact, our second quarter cash from operations position also requested a discretionary U.S. pension contribution of $300 million. When these two elements are taken into account to allow for an apples-to-apples comparison underlying cash generation improved between the first and second quarter by about $500 million. This improvement reflected higher Brent prices of about $7.50 per barrel and higher WTI prices of about $5 per barrel. Our upstream realizations did not fully capture the quarterly increase in global oil prices, largely due to portfolio mix effects surrounding the Brent WTI differential. We also saw lower Asia LNG spot prices during the quarter. Year-to-date, affiliate dividends were $1.8 billion less than earnings. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 billion and $6.2 billion year-to-date, in line with our 2018 budget. We had 50% year-on-year improvement in operating cash flow from 2016 to 2017. We expect a similar improvement trajectory from 2017 to 2018. We anticipate second half cash generation will reflect higher production, strong upstream cash margins, additional proceeds from asset sales and some reversals of working capital requirements. These positives are expected be offset only modestly by another discretionary U.S. pension contribution. Turning to Slide 5. This favorable outlook on cash flow, combined with our ongoing commitment to capital discipline, enables us to initiate share repurchases, targeted at $3 billion per year. Our financial priorities are unchanged. We are generating cash surplus to what we need to meet the first three of these. We increased our annual dividend by 4% earlier in the year. We continue to be very selective and disciplined in our investments. And we have an advantaged portfolio and a large captured resource base. We plan to ratably develop these resources within the $18 billion to $20 billion capital range we previously indicated through 2020. Our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger. We will take advantage of higher price period like we\u2019re seeing now to modestly reduce our debt level overtime. We\u2019ll start repurchases in the third quarter. Going forward, we will provide an update at the end of every quarter on our progress. We believe annual share repurchases of $3 billion can be sustained over most reasonable price scenarios. Turning to Slide 6. Just a quick update on our portfolio optimization efforts. We have previously indicated our intent to generate between $5 billion and $10 billion in targeted asset sale proceeds over the three year period 2018 to 2020. We remain confident in this range. On a year-to-date basis, we have had sales proceeds of approximately $700 million, primarily from the sale of our upstream non-operated joint venture interest in the Elk Hills Field in California and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Later this year, we expect to close the Southern African downstream transaction. When that happens, 2018 will be right on pace with our three year target. A few weeks ago, we announced our decision to market our UK Central North Sea assets. As with any transaction, we will only execute if we believe it is aligned with our strategic objective and we receive good value. Turning to Slide 7. Second quarter 2018 after tax earnings were $2 billion higher than second quarter 2017. Special item impacts were comparable in the two periods and hence do not show up as a variance bar in the aggregate for the enterprise. Favorable movements in foreign exchange positively impacted earnings between the periods by $262 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by approximately $2.3 billion between periods, mainly on improved realizations and higher lifting. Downstream earnings, excluding foreign exchange, decreased by about $400 million mostly due to an unfavorable swing and timing effect, higher operating expenses largely due to planned turnaround activity, lower Asia margins and the absence of our Canadian refining and marketing business. The variance in the other segment, excluding special items, was primarily the result of higher interest expense since less interest is being capitalized currently compared to the prior year. Turning to Slide 8. This compares results for second quarter 2018 with first quarter 2018. Second quarter results were approximately $230 million lower than the first quarter. For special items, the second quarter included the $270 million non-recurring receivables write-down, while the first quarter included $120 million asset impairment. Foreign exchange impacts were a positive variance of $136 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were essentially flat between the quarters. Higher realizations were offset by higher operating expense and DD&A. Downstream earnings, excluding foreign exchange, improved by about $80 million, reflecting higher volume and stronger U.S. West Coast refining and marketing margins. The variance in the other segment largely reflected higher corporate charges and lower capitalized interest. As I indicated last quarter, our guidance for the other segment is $2.4 billion in annual net charges and the quarterly results are not ratable with year-to-date charges of nearly $1.2 billion, we are trending in line with our earlier guidance. I'll now pass it on to Jay.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Pat. On Slide 9, second quarter 2018 production was an increase of 46,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of 2017. Major capital projects increased production by 180,000 barrels a day as we continue to ramp-up multiple projects, most significantly Wheatstone and Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased 91,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian. Base declines, net of production from new wells such in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria, were 51,000 barrels a day. The impact for 2017 and 2018 asset sales reduced production by 77,000 barrels a day between the periods. Entitlement effects reduced production by 54,000 barrels a day as both rising prices and lower spend reduced cost recovery barrels. Planned and unplanned downtime, along with the impacts from external events, reduced production by 43,000 barrels a day during the quarter. Overall, the first half of 2018 production is up 4% relative to the first half of 2017. Turning to Slide 10. Second quarter production was 2.83 million barrels per day, taking our year-to-date production to 2.84 million barrels per day. Excluding the impact of 2018 asset sales, which is the middle bar, our year-to-date production growth was 4.5% higher than the daily average production for full year 2017. This is in line with our guidance. As Pat mentioned last quarter, planned turnaround activity across multiple locations began in earnest in the second quarter. The production impact from turnarounds in the second quarter was 67,000 barrels a day. We expect heavier planned turnaround activity in the third quarter. The production impact from 2018 asset sales was 15,000 barrels a day in the second quarter with a year-to-date impact of 8,000 barrels a day. With the successful startup for Wheatstone Train 2, continued growth in the Permian and ramp-ups at Hebron, Stamped and Tahiti vertical expansion project, we expect production to further increase in the second half of this year. Our outlook for the full year is expected to be in the top half of our guidance range even without normalizing for the impact of price at current levels. Turning to Slide 11, Chevron is now Australia's largest producer of LNG and the proud operator of five LNG trains with a total installed liquefaction capacity of 24.5 million tons per year. Our facilities, along with available capacity and other facilities in northwest Australia will enable us to monetize our world-class natural gas resource base for decades to come. Wheatstone Train 2 achieved first production in mid-June. The ramp-up has exceeded expectations as Train 2 reach nameplate capacity within weeks of startup. We've already exported the equivalent of six cargoes of Train 2 production, and we\u2019re planning to take a pit stop in the third quarter to remove the start up strainers. Its companion plan, Wheatstone Train 1, has also been running well. The train has demonstrated nameplate capacity and has now run 195 consecutive days without a day of downtime. We also successfully completed the planned pit stop on Gorgon Train 2. The Gordon pit stops have been successful and we\u2019re seeing improvements in performance and reliability. As a casing point, Gorgon Train 1, since its pit stop, has run more than 285 days without a day of downtime. Combined net production from our operated LNG trains was 282,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. With Wheatstone Train 2 ramping up and Gorgon Train 2 back online, we\u2019re already seeing net production approaching 400,000 barrels per day. Let's turn to Slide 12. I recently returned from a trip to Kazakhstan. Our base business at TCO is running well and FGP WPMP project is progressing as guided towards first production in 2022. The project is estimated to be 40% complete with preassembled pipe racks, process modules and a gas turbine generator all in transit from yards in Kazakhstan, Korea, and Italy. Six pipe rack modules have been successfully delivered to sites, demonstrating the operability of the delivery system and the receiving facilities. Site work continues to focus on foundation, undergrounds and infrastructure in preparation for module installation. Major mechanical, electrical and instrumentation contracts have been awarded. We also have three drilling rigs operating on multi-well pads, and drilling is ahead of schedule. If you recall back in March that I said 2018 is a critical year for execution. This is the first year of module fabrication and site construction, as well as initiation of the module transportation system. With engineering approaching 85% complete and fabrication of 40% complete, we are seeing cost pressure on the project. Site productivity remains a key driver of success for the project and is a major focus for our team. Turning to the Permian, on Slide 13. Permian shale and tight production in the second quarter was 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing an increase of about 92,000 barrels a day, up 50% relative to the same quarter last year. Our development strategy continues to center around disciplined execution and capital efficiency. We\u2019re currently running 19 rigs and our development program is progressing as planned. While activity levels are high in the Permian, Chevron has not experienced supply shortages in the second quarter. And we\u2019re securing the dedicated crews and materials needed to execute the plan we\u2019ve previously described. We continue to focus on well performance and the optimization of our well factory. This requires coordination and planning, starting with our land position, running through the drilling and completion strategy, as well as the design and construction of facilities. And it ends with the midstream arrangements to ensure that we bring produced oil, gas and NGLs to market at competitive realizations. Turn to Slide 14. We\u2019re currently operating eight development areas and participating in approximately 30 joint venture developments operated by others. We continue to proactively manage and strengthen our land position. Year-to-date, we've transacted 31,000 acres through swaps, joint ventures, farm-outs and sales. We've previously mentioned that some of the highest value transactions are swaps that allow us the core of acreage and enable long length laterals. As the land transaction example on the right depicts, coring-up acreage provides an opportunity to double the lateral length of each well and optimize facilities, which in turn, lowers our unit development cost. In this case, the acreage swap increase the number of long-length lateral wells we can drill by approximately 600, and improve the forecasted internal rate of return for each well by more than 30%. Since 2016, we've increased our average lateral length per well in the Permian by approximately 35%. We\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to core-up acreage and improve the capital efficiency of our Permian program. Let's turn to Slide 15. Last quarter, Mark discuss the value of being an integrated company, and our strategy for maximizing returns in the Permian. Chevron has secured from transport capacity at competitive rates to move the equivalent of nearly all of our forecasted 2018 and 2019 operated and NOJV taking kind oil production to multiple markets, including the U.S. Gulf Coast. As a result of these contractual arrangement and long-term planning, this equivalent production is not materially exposed to the Midland basis differential. Our share of NOJV oil production not taken in kind is approximately 20% of our Permian crude volumes. We previously mentioned that the pipeline takeaway capacity and production don't always move in perfect lockstep, they'll be periods of tightness and length. As an example, in June, we had more than 50,000 barrels a day of excess takeaway capacity out of the Midland basin, which we monetize through purchases of third-party volumes. We expect that excess capacity to attenuate through the rest of the year as our production continues to grow. Agreements are in place to access additional pipeline capacity in early 2019 in line with our production growth forecast. In July, we utilized firm dock capacity in the Houston ship channel to gain access to world markets for Permian source crews. We have firm contractual arrangements in place to further increase that dock capacity in 2019. Overall, we've exported more than 8 million barrels of liquids from the Gulf Coast in 2018, further demonstrating our midstream's ability to batch, blend, trade and export to secure the highest value for our products. We\u2019re developing processing arrangements for NGLs and we have flow assurance for natural gas to ensure the production will not be impacted. We are moving forward with our development plans in the Permian, and we do not intend the slowdown activity or divert capital. Pat, back to you.\nPat Yarrington: Okay, just a couple of closing comments about the first half and expectations for the remainder of the year. Cash from operations, excluding working capital is materializing as expected, given the market conditions, production levels and asset reliability that we have achieved. The picture for total cash flow in the second half looks promising as well. We expect second half upstream cash margins to improve and our 2018 projected volume increases are backend loaded, giving us confidence that our full year product outlook is trending towards the upper half of the guidance range. In addition, we should we see some relief in working capital and additional asset sales proceeds. Capital spending is on budget for the first six months. And so in total, we have a very attractive offering for investors; a growing dividend, assets that are strong cash generators, a healthy balance sheet and finally, sufficient free cash flow to enable a share repurchase program. In short, we are delivering on all of our commitments. So that concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019re now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we have a lot of folks on the queue and so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up, if necessary, and we will certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, go ahead and open the line please.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you very much, and congratulations on the buyback. It's great to see you\u2019re making this step. I want to start there and see how you guys were framing the $3 billion number. How did you arrive at that being the right level? And to your point about this being an every year number, how should we think about this? Should we think of this as a base load fixed cost, if you will, on a go-forward basis in any foreseeable price environment? Or is this more of a flywheel dynamic?\nPat Yarrington: You hit upon in a way you asked the question some of the keywords for us, which really are, we do want this to be a sustainable element here. So we obviously took a look at multiple price scenarios and we felt that this level of sustainability -- we could handle this almost through any reasonable price environment there. We pay attention to what expectations are in the market. And you can see, if you look at the futures market, there is a bit of peak this year next year and then maybe some downward trend. So obviously, that\u2019s a scenario that we took into account. And with that we felt that the $3 billion level was sustainable.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.\nPhil Gresh: Yes, good morning. I echo Neil's sentiment. Congratulations on the buyback. I guess it's somewhat of a follow-up question. You gave helpful color around cash from operations. It sounds like it supposed to be up 50% year over year, I think is what you said. And so that would be about $30 billion of CFO. If I look at that on a post-dividend, post-CapEx basis, you'd have about $9 billion of post-dividend free cash flow. And so it sounded like you said in your prepared remarks there is also maybe some desire to pay debt down a little bit. But just wondering how you think about that? Obviously, a third of this incremental is going back to the shareholder. But are you trying to save money for a rainy day? Or how do you think about that considering you also have asset sale proceeds coming up?\nPat Yarrington: I think it\u2019s a great question and you are trying relating on the numbers quite accurately there. All I would like to say just from the start, we\u2019d like to hit the cash in the door and see it before we over commit on it. So there might be a bit of conservatism here in how we started. But if you step back and think about the price environment that we\u2019re in and the price environment that may be expected as that market is telling us over the next couple of years that maybe coming, which would be a lower price environment. We think it's prudent at this point in time to strengthen the balance a bit sheet when commodity prices are high. And so we do anticipate a little bit of debt pay down over the next period of time. We\u2019re certainly in a comfortable position from a leverage standpoint. But paying it down a little bit and showing up the balance sheet little bit, we think would be an improvement -- or we'd have willingness to go there to a small degree. Obviously, if you're building up cash little bit and paying down debt little bit, it gives you a bit of an insurance policy, when times get tougher to meet the commitments that you've already laid out there. And by that I mean the commitments that you put out there in terms of dividends and also now the commitment we have around share repurchases and the sustainability we hope to have around share repurchases. I don't -- they don't have the same level of commitments, share repurchases are the fourth in our priorities, dividends come first. But obviously, we\u2019d like to have as much readability and predictability around share repurchases as we can.\nPhil Gresh: If I could ask a quick follow-up, just on the production guidance, you\u2019re comfortable with the high end of the range. Despite, I think Jay said, despite the entitlement effects, which I think in the second quarter, is 2% year-over-year impact. So maybe you can just provide some color around what you think is going better than your expectations? Is it all Permian or are there other things as well?\nJay Johnson: So I think the primary thing that gives us some confidence is that we started out Wheatstone Train 2 very late in the second quarter. It has come up very cleanly and is running well. We continue to see growth in the Permian and we have ramp-ups going on, as I said, on a number of capital projects. We have some turnaround activity in the third quarter, which will be bit of a drag on production. But as we move through that, and as we move into the fourth quarter, overall, with these new projects coming online and our relatively low base decline, we really feel pretty comfortable about where we are in our production profile through the rest of the year, barring unforeseen events.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.\nPaul Cheng: Jay, did I hear you correctly. You were saying that turnkey, you are seeing some cost pressure or sign of cost pressure. Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of how big -- is that really going to be a big problem or what [material] we\u2019re talking about and where is the source of the cost pressure?\nJay Johnson: So we are seeing some cost pressure. We are now, as I said, approaching 85% complete on the engineering. We\u2019re about 40% complete on fabrication. We\u2019re having a full-year of construction in the field. Where we are seeing some cost pressures at this point in time, our engineering program has cost more than we would have been anticipated. We had some design quality issues but also our productivity overall has been lower on engineering than expected. We've also seen some of our major contracts come in for field construction a little higher than what we expected. When we put all that together, we are using more of the contingency at this point in time than we would have expected or anticipated, and so that signals that we\u2019re seeing cost pressure on the project. We've talked about getting through this season. We really need to see how the performance goes. There is a lot of important milestones. The good things that are happening, the fabrication is really working well. We are seeing high quality come out of the modules and sales as they are being completed and shipped to Tengiz. We successfully tested the logistics system and we have delivered modules all the way to sites. So those things are all working quite well. But what we need to do is we are 40% complete on this project. It's large, it's complex and we've used more of the contingency at this point than we would've expected. So that tells us we have cost pressure on this project. We will continue to access it and we will update you accordingly as we need to.\nPaul Cheng: And at what point that you will be more certain whether you have to raise your overall budget? Is it six months from now? Where is the maybe the critical path that you need to pass in order for you to know whether that you will be able to stay within the budget or it's going to be higher?\nJay Johnson: We continue to assess our performance Paul, as we move through the project. This is a 5, 6 year project overall duration. So, we are still relatively early in the project. The site productivity is really going to be important. And as we go through this year and can really assess where we are and look at that site productivity, it is a full-court press in the field to really make sure we are making the progress, but in making that progress using the number of man-hours and the resources that we expected. So, we are very focused on the timely delivery of engineering and engineer design and bulk materials. We want to make sure that we've got our crews ready that the workforce planning is in place and that we have sufficient support of our workforce, so that we get the most out of that crew. So, it's hard to put a definite time on it. We will continue to monitor our performance. We build these into our business plan. At this point, I do not see it impacting our guidance of 18 billion to 20 billion. And we will keep you updated as we gain more information.\nPaul Cheng: My second question. Jay, when you guys do economic analysis, do you primarily use the real price? Or are you using the nominal price as the base case?\nJay Johnson: The real price of oil do you mean?\nPaul Cheng: Yes.\nJay Johnson: We have a corporate price forecast which we use as our basis for our economic assumptions, but more importantly, we also test our business plan against both higher and lower price scenarios to make sure that we have a robust plan that takes into account. The one thing we do know with certainty is that we cannot predict the oil price. So, we want to plan that really is able to respond and adjust accordingly with options for whatever the price turns out to be.\nPaul Cheng: I'm sorry that I probably didn't make myself clear. When I say real price, means that the price adjusted for inflation. Do you build in an inflation factor, whatever is the price deck that you use? Or you just use a nominal flat price in your assumptions? So when you guys previously saying that Tengiz would be a $60 or low $60 Brent price would be generating a 10% return or 15% return, is that the price is based on inflation adjusted or nominal?\nPat Yarrington: It's based on inflation adjusted. I mean we look at what we expect price is to be because the costs out estimates that we are putting together have those kind of components built in. But when we are taking the project to evaluation when we are doing the final investment decision, we look at a whole host of price scenarios and we look at both nominal and real outcomes. What would you have to believe to have a 10% rate of return in a nominal sense? What would you have to have it in a real sense? So, we look at the economics and judge the value of the project based on multiple price scenarios. But when we are actually putting out an FID kind of number, it is our best estimate of what that cost at that point in time will be.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: I've got two questions, if I may. I guess the first one is an upstream question. When you laid out the Analyst Day back in March, obviously you kept your guidance through 2020. And if we take, Pat, what you said about the buyback being sustainable, it seems at least on our numbers in the current oil price environment you have got a lot more headroom in terms of surplus cash. But I'm curious, what are your intentions post 2020? Should we expect the current level of spending to be sustained? Or is that headroom to allow for, let's say, another step-up in project visibility as we go beyond, for example, Tengiz as we go beyond 2020? I've got a quick follow-up, please.\nPat Yarrington: Dough, I think I'll just start and say, we feel good about the $18 billion to $20 billion range out through 2020. Because we can see our way forward that far with the quality of the resource base we have, the production profile that we've got laid out for the Permian, and other unconventional. Our ability to take what is relatively a less mature asset base like LNG and debottlenecking and see continued value growth there, we have a whole series of investments that we can see lined out that our current portfolio gives us opportunity to develop economically and that's why we feel comfortable about the $18 billion to $20 billion range. When you get beyond 2020, we really will have to have a review of other incremental projects that we would like to bring online. At some point, we believe that there will be the opportunity to add deepwater investment. For example, those are competing now or they're working to get their cost structure down, so that they can compete better in the portfolio that time will come. We've said in the past that we want to be ratable in terms of how many we bring on bring those on at what time frame and what sort of pacing we do. So, that's all stuff that we will put together as we are looking at our 2019 to 2021 plan, and as all information that we will try to come out and provide a little bit more guidance for when we get to our Security Analyst Meeting in March 2019. But for now, I think the key message is $18 billion to $20 million that's the capital program that's the capital discipline that were living within.\nDoug Leggate: Jay maybe I can follow-up with you specifically than on another potential source of cash because you guys have obviously got tremendous flexibility with the Permian, but it is also very early and your 5 billion to $10 billion disposal plan and since you laid that out the oil prices obviously recovered quite a bit so, so I guess what I'm asking Jay is it that upside to your disposal target, how is the change in oil price changed your view of what's covered in the portfolio and I'll leave it there.\nJay Johnson: I would say that as we look at assets that are going to be part of our portfolio work, we tend to look at assets that are approaching end of life or either very early in life. So early in life would be resource opportunities that we have that just don't compete for capital in the portfolio. They maybe economic, quite of economics, but they don't compete for capital and or trying to be very disciplined about what projects we invest and only invest in the top part of our queue. The projects that are very late in life tend to have limited resource potential left for us and those are the ones we are putting out there that higher prices certainly help. But I wouldn\u2019t change our guidance at this point in time. This is going to be a pretty ratable program. It's a pretty normal part of our operation to continue to look at properties as they move through their lifecycle and decide when do they need to exit the portfolio. Our overall focus on all of this, we are not driving your production target we are driving to improve our returns and lead the industry and our returns on the upstream assets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.\nJason Gammel: Jay, it's very positive comments on the operations in Australia essentially reaching nameplate capacity already. And obviously, very long duration runs on several of the trains. I guess my question is given this performance, how should we think about utilization rates in 2019 on the LNG facilities, recognizing that obviously some maintenance still needs to be done? But that there are probably some debottlenecking opportunities in the near term that you might be able to take advantage of?\nJay Johnson: Yes, we have not issued any formal guidance around this yet. We are going through the business plan now when we really develop that. But I would say that we took all the knowledge from the Gordon Train 1 and apply that to 2 and 3. We have gone through the pit stops now. So, we are really pretty comfortable with where these trains are and we just need to get some run time and do the analysis to see where the opportunities are for further expansion. One of the best ways to extend the capacity of these trains of course is just keeping them fully online and fully utilize and so that's our primary focus at the moment. Wheatstone is a very similar story. Train 1 started up we had a pretty clean startup but taking all those lessons learned train 2 was started up very cleanly and at this point in time, we do not have any anticipation of taking those down. So we may have from time to time as we said before, you know some of the small pit stops if we see economically driven opportunities to enhance performance as we have done, but overall I think a lot of the other than routine maintenance a lot of the unknown shutdowns at this point in time are behind us. We will get into a regular rotation of shutdowns as all major trains do and that's on our three or four-year cycle as we get these and we want to have them staggered out. But that's all being sorted out in our business plan and for now we would expect to see some pretty good sustained runs on these trains.\nJason Gammel: That's very helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Jay, could you comment on timing on first production at Big Foot and whether you are actively engaged in restarting production in the PZ?\nJay Johnson: Yes, so at Big Foot, we still expect to see production started later this year. We have made good progress. We got the platform successfully installed in storm safe, as you know early in the first quarter of this year. The drilling program is underway. We are completing the first 12 and we are moving through and just about bring buyback gas into the facility to start the final commissioning. So later in this year, we will expect to see production at Big Foot. We've already run, in fact, some of the second riser just to make sure loop currents aren\u2019t a factor for us in that program. As we look at the PZ, of course it's an ongoing issue that the two governments are working to resolve. Our focus is on making sure that we are keeping the facilities and are ready to restart mode. We are very focused on asset integrity and preservation types of activities. We have also done a lot of engineering and use this time of downtime to model, not only a more comprehensive reservoir set of models, but also the surface facilities and really identified all of the opportunities of low hanging fruit to optimize the flow once we get the facilities back online. So, I think there is a lot of good opportunities for us when it restarts. We remain ready to go and off course we will support the governments as they work towards resolution.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nRoger Read: If we could, Jay, maybe come back to the Midland Delaware Basin, the takeaway. And then you've been over the last several quarters exceeding the guidance range that was laid out at the Analyst Day. So I was just curious, as you think about the capacity to take away, both on the oil and gas side, the fact you are running ahead of the guidance range. Does that create any risk? And then the second part of my question is as you move non-operated or non-produced barrels that 50,000 barrels a day, and replace them with your own. How does that flow through in terms of performance? I would assume better cash capture, cash margin capture, on your own barrels than third party, but I was just curious how that works out.\nJay Johnson: So I'll take the first question or first part of the question. The higher production that we're seeing from our operations is taking into account. Our midstream group and our business unit, they are in daily conversation about where we are, what our updated forecast look like, so that we don't catch anyone by surprise. The midstream group has done an outstanding job of working with various suppliers and services in areas for our takeaway capacity. We have adopted the strategies and our focus is on maximizing returns from the Permian, and that's what drives all of our efforts. So where we have had opportunities to not invest our capital, but rather contract for service like pipelines and takeaway capacity, our gas plants and things where we can tariff through someone else capital at a better rate, we've chosen to do so. But that means we have to be very coordinated with all these various suppliers to ensure the capacities in place, and accommodating our growth plans. So at this point in time we look very good through 2018 and 2019. We just will continue to monitor this there is periods of tightness, periods of excess capacity and we look to take opportunity to acquire other crudes and move them through those lines when the opportunities present themselves in the form of the differential exceeding the tariff. I do think in terms of the -- when we think about the NOJV, we almost have to think of the upstream producers into the Midland basin -- into the Midland area. And then our midstream takes crude from the Midland area and moves it to markets and that are crude and others crude. So it's really a big machine but it's hard to say one specific barrel moves through the system. It's, more of a commercial arrangement and equipment volumes. Our goal is to make sure that we are getting the maximum returns for the barrels that we produce, whether they're non-operated or operated barrel, as we move those to the various markets. The other thing that our midstream has done it's been really helpful is not just get pipeline capacity out of the basin into the various markets, but then they have also made arrangements, so that we can move this as we said across the doc into ships and access world markets as well. And so, it really lets us take a forward look at those markets and adjust our off-take as we need to maximize our realizations.\nPat Yarrington: And I wanted to add one of the benefits of being an integrated company and it's also one of the benefits of being a company that focuses on a longer-term plan. We have been under this plan of the 20 rig rate in the Permian for a quite some time. And all of these precursors have been lined out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP Paribas. Your question please.\nTheepan Jothilingam: A couple of questions, actually. Firstly, I think you gave guidance at the Analyst Day on the headwinds in the cash flow of somewhere between $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. So I just wanted to know whether that guidance is still valid and how much of those headwinds have been consumed in the first half. And then the second question. I think we've been given an update in terms of the uncon business, particularly for the Permian. But I was just wondering how the rest of the unconventional business, the Duvernay Argentina is looking as one reviews the last six months.\nPat Yarrington: I\u2019ll take them in order I think. So, yes, good question about the headwinds. So year-to-date, through this first six months we are sitting at combined headwinds of about 3.6 billion. The guidance that I had given back in March was between 2.5 and 3.5. Actually, I think that is still good guidance may in fact come in a little bit lower, I mean a little bit towards the low end of the range. What we are seeing here with higher prices is that the differed tax headwind that we thought would materialize at lower prices is really almost turning into, essentially turning into a tailwind here at higher prices, and that\u2019s exactly what you would expect. So bottom line somewhere between 2.5 to 3.5 but probably closer to the bottom end of that range.\nJay Johnson: And as far as our other unconventional activities, we have continued to see very good progress in all three of the assets. I\u2019ll just walk through them one at a time. The three rigs we've increased from two to three rigs down in Argentina worked very well with our operator YPF. We are seeing continued improvement in our performance down there. The economic returns are looking very strong. I think what's really important in Argentina is they continue to deal with some of their situation. Maintaining an open market will be an important watch point for us as we continue to move forward with our operations in the Vaca Muerta. We also have a field called El Trapial, which was a conventional field that\u2019s in the northern part of that area. And we are planning to do in an eight well pilot for the unconventional potential under El Trapial, and there is a lot of expectation that that may also improve to be a good area for us from an unconventional sense. We have restarted our drilling campaign in the Marcellus. We took a couple of year holiday just to reduce our capital during the last couple years. So, we are now moving back in the operation there, and the initial results coming out of the Marcellus as we picked up right where we left off and continued our march to lower our unit development and operating cost. So I'm pretty pleased with what we are seeing in the Marcellus and Utica areas. And then finally, up at Kaybob DuVernay in Canada we are also seeing good performance from our crews up there. We have moved from largely a land tenure and assessment of appraisal drilling mode into our first factory mode and have our first development area, that\u2019s about 55,000 acres that we started on in November 2017. So, as we shift from moving rigs around and appraisal drilling to actually development drilling, we expect to see that continued improvement in performance there. One of the things that has been really successful for us over the last two or three years has been bringing these various teams together they need on a regular basis best practices are shared between the different areas. So while they all have different characteristics, there is far more in common than there is different. And the techniques, the best practices, the use of data analytics, just a lot of the experience that we gain on a daily basis instead of just being in one area now were deploying that across all four and it doesn\u2019t just flow from the Permian outward. Things like zipper fracking actually came from the Marcellus into the Permian and so, we see that leveraging of knowledge and experience is quite powerful and very valuable force us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. As you are working to expand Gorgon, I know that the Australian government is prioritizing more domestic gas supply, particularly for the eastern states in the country. And how do you kind of balance out your higher export demand with the fact that there is a brewing shortage domestically in the market?\nJay Johnson: We would love to sell them LNG to start with, but what's really important for Australia as with country is energy security. You always want to make sure your country has efficient supply of clean, affordable, reliable energy source. And so in the West Australia, there is no pipeline, there is no way to transport gas from the west to the east. Other than through LNG, we continue to produce LNG. We have extensive gas resources in the west 50 trillion cubic feet of gas as Chevron equity gas. Our focus is on making sure we have domestic gas plants at both Gorgon and Wheatstone. We have plenty of capacity to supply the west Australia, but we also are really focused on making sure that we move and monetize that gas resource to the various markets that are demanding in. So, at this point, I don't see the East Coast problems having any impact on either the expansion or the delivery from west Australia.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay. A quick follow-up on your monetization plans. You mentioned some of the upstream assets. Given the very hot demand these days for Permian midstream capacity, is that something that you would consider including in your divestment planning?\nJay Johnson: We don't really have midstream assets per say in the Permian area. We have been focusing on the upstream that's where we see highest value and highest returns and are takeaway capacity in the midstream processing like gas plants NGLs is provided by third parties.\nPat Yarrington: Okay, thank you very much. I think that concludes the queue here. So, I guess, we're already to end the call. I'd like to thank everybody for your time today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and we appreciate the questions that came in. Thank you very much. Jonathan, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-04-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.\nPat Yarrington: Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Mark Nelson, Vice President of Midstream, Strategy & Policy. Also joining us on the call are Frank Mount and Wayne Borduin who are currently transitioning in a role of General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's Web site. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement here on Slide 2. Turning to Slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s first quarter earnings were $3.6 billion or $1.90 per diluted share. Earnings excluding foreign exchange and special items were also $3.6 billion. A reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange and other non GAAP measure can be found in an appendix to this presentation. This is our strongest earnings result since the third quarter of 2014 when Brent prices were above $100. For the current quarter, Brent price averaged $67 per barrel. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $5 billion. Excluding working capital effect, cash flow from operations was $7.1 billion. At quarter end, debt balances stood at approximately $40 billion, which resulted in a headline debt ratio of 20.9% and a net debt ratio of 18.1%. During the first quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends. We currently yield 3.6%. Turning to Slide 4. We are on track to deliver on our 2018 cash generation guidance from our recent analyst meeting. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital effects, grew to $7.1 billion. Positive impacts of strong realizations and high-margin volume growth were partially offset by equity affiliate dividends that were about $1 billion lower than equity affiliate earnings. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3 billion, approximately $300 million or 10% below first quarter 2017, as we continue to complete our major capital projects under construction and drive improved capital efficiency across our portfolio. The results free cash flow, excluding working capital effects, was $4.2 billion approximately $2.5 billion higher than the average quarter in 2017. Assets held proceeds within the quarter were minimal. However, with the closing in April of the Elk Hills transaction and the anticipated closing of the sale of our Southern Africa downstream business later this year, we remain on track for asset sales proceeds of $1 billion to $3 billion in 2018. Turning to Slide 5. As many of you are aware, working capital effects impact our business unevenly throughout the year. These impacts are to a large degree transitory. Because of this uneven pattern by quarter, many of you exclude working capital impacts from your models. However, while uneven by quarter, our pattern is fairly consistent year-to-year. The chart drawn from this decade average working capital impacts demonstrates the pattern. Normally, working capital is a cash penalty in the first and second quarters followed by a cash benefit in the third and fourth quarters. The variation has at times been 2 to 3 times the quarterly average is shown. This reason is fairly consistent and may result from seasonal inventory builds and draws as well as the timing of the prior JV partner and tax payments. We anticipate this year\u2019s pattern to be no different. If price levels generally hold where they are today, we expect the majority of the $2.1 billion of working capital consumed during first quarter to be released throughout the remainder of the year. The residual is expected to be most of receivables related to both higher prices and higher production compared to 2017. Turning to Slide 6. First quarter 2018 results were approximately $950 million higher than first quarter 2017. Special items, primarily the absence of first quarter 2017 gains from the sale of our Indonesia geothermal assets coupled with the first quarter 2018 U.S. upstream asset impairment, decreased earnings by $720 million between periods. A swing in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings between the periods by $370 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased around $2.2 billion between the periods, mainly on improved realizations and higher listings. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by about $255 million, mostly due to an unfavorable swing in timing effects and lower volumes largely from the sale of our Canadian assets. The variance in the other segment was primarily the result of the absence of prior year's favorable corporate tax items. As we indicated previously our guidance for the other segment is $2.4 billion in annual net charges, so quarterly results are like to be non ratable. Turning now to Slide 7, a beautiful chart as I do say so myself. This compares results for the first quarter 2018 with fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter results were approximately $530 million higher than the fourth quarter. Special items mainly from the absence of the fourth quarter 2017 U.S. tax reform gain, decreased earnings between periods by approximately $2 billion. While a swing in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by $225 million between the periods. Upstream result excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by around $1.4 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations and listings along with lower depreciation and operating expenses. Downstream earnings excluding special items since foreign exchange, improved by about $540 million, reflecting higher earnings from CPChem, mainly due to the absence of fourth quarter 2017 hurricane impacts along with improved refining and marketing margins. The variance in the other segments largely reflects lower corporate charges and a favorable swing in corporate tax items between quarters. Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter production was 2.852 million barrels per day, an increase of 4.5% over average 2017 production and within our guidance range for 2018. This production level represents an all-time quarterly high for the company. Growth is expected to continue during 2018 with Wheatstone Train 2 coming online, major capital project such as Wheatstone, Hebron and Stamped ramping up and continued growth in our shale and tight assets. During the quarter, the impact of asset sales on production was negligible. In the second quarter, we forecast the quarterly asset sale impact of around 15,000 barrels per day, mainly from our recent Elk Hills and Democratic Republic of the Congo transactions. We\u2019ll also start our plan to turnaround activity in the second quarter. Our full year production guidance remains unchanged at 4% to 7% growth over 2017, excluding the impact of asset sales. On Slide 9, first quarter 2018 production was an increase 176,000 barrels a day or 6.6% from first quarter 2017. Major capital projects increased production by 228,000 barrels a day as we started and ramped up multiple projects, including Gorgon and Wheatstone. Shale and tight production increased to 101,000 barrels a day, mainly due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian. Base declines net of production from new wells, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria, were 39,000 barrels a day. The impact of 2017 asset sales, mainly in the U.S. midcontinent, Gulf of Mexico and South Natuna Sea, reduced production by 61,000 barrels a day. Entitlement effects reduced production by 50,000 barrels a day as rising prices and lower spend reduced cost recovery barrels. Turning to Slide 10, Gorgon and Wheatstone delivered strong and reliable performance in the first quarter. First quarter net production was 202,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Gordon and 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Wheatstone. We shipped 69 LNG and four condensate cargoes, and were able to take it advantage of rising oil linked price, as well as strong Asia LNG spot prices, which averaged over $10 per BOE for the quarter. We continue to fine tune the plants to enhance reliability and boost capacity. These efforts are yielding favorable results. Gorgon first quarter production is more than 5% higher than our previous best quarter. And Wheatstone Train 1 has been running well. We have a planned pit stop on Gorgon Train 2 next month to replicate performance improvement modifications that we have made in the other two trains. And work on Wheatstone Train 2 is progressing well and commissioning activities are ongoing. The warm end is expected to be ready for start up shortly and we\u2019re expecting begin LNG production this quarter. Dom gas is expected to start up late in the third quarter. Turning to the Permian. Permian shale and tight production in the first quarter was up about 100,000 barrel a day or 65% relative to the same quarter last year. Looking forward, we forecast Permian unconventional growth of 30% to 40% annually through 2020. All of this is premised on running 20 company-operated and approximately nine net rigs on NOJV properties by year end. In March, we guided to 2% to 3% annual growth from our base plus shale and tight business through 2022 at $9 billion to $10 billion of annual capital spend. We are currently running 17 rigs and expect to stand up our 18th company-operated rig next month. We also continue creating value through land transactions. We executed nine deals, swapping approximately 25,000 acres in the first quarter, and we have several others under negotiation. As you know, these laterals enable high-value longer laterals. We often get questions about our Permian takeaway capacity, as well as other questions on the industry macro environment. Mark heads up our Midstream and Strategy Group and will provide some additional insight. Over to you Mark.\nMark Nelson: Thanks Pat. As Pat mentioned, we get questions these days about Permian related differentials, the long-term oil market and LNG supply and demand. So turning to Slide 12, let\u2019s continue with the Permian story. Where we believe optimizing the value chain from well head to customer differentiates Chevron from many in the business. As you know, our advantage starts with our land position and our factoring model, and continued with the market knowledge of each barrels value at any point in time and ends with the ability to appropriately place those barrels. For example, recent crew differentials in the Midland Basin have widened; and we\u2019ve secured flow and preserved margins by proactively procuring enough capacity to move product to multiple market centers; negotiating highly competitive transportation rates; batching and blending to meet market demands and avoid price discounts; and by accessing the best world markets for each barrels with our export capabilities. Simply said, our goal is to maximize the return on every Permian molecule. Another question that is often asked is reflected on Slide 13. And that is what role does oil play in meeting the world's growing energy demand in the decades to come. In developing our point of view, as you would expect, we use detailed internal and external analysis to evaluate supply-demand scenarios and the associated opportunities and risks in our business. Our macro liquids view is similar to a number of independent assessments, and we\u2019re showing one of these assessments, the IEA new policies scenario in the upper right. We believe that oil demand will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, and the need for incremental supply continues to exist in any realistic scenario. Reinforcing this view today is liquids demand continues to be in the higher end of most independent forecasts. The chart at the bottom right illustrates another of our points of view. We believe in a longer flatter supply curve. Despite the recent run-up in prices, we believe capital discipline, cost management and market signpost, will always matter. And we are well-positioned to win in any environment given our advantaged portfolio. Turning to Page 12 and the macro LNG view, this graph reflects the latest LNG demand projections from Wood Mackenzie with their supply forecast. Highlighting that the LNG market is becoming oversupplied in the short term as new projects continue to ramp up in both the Pacific and Atlantic basin. North Asian LNG demand, however, especially in China was stronger last winter than the market anticipated. In fact, 2017 Chinese gas demand was up 15% year-on-year with LNG imports up 46%. While this growth rate may moderate, the demand drivers appear mostly sustainable with coal to gas switching in residential and industrial applications mandated by the Chinese government to reduce air pollution. So the LNG market should rebalance with a supply gap expected to open before the middle of the next decade. And this is where Gorgon and Wheatstone capacity Creek and debottlenecking opportunities will fit very nicely. Only the most competitive cost competitive projects we\u2019ll be able to move forward in this space and we will be very disciplined with our investment, and we\u2019ll fund only those projects that will generate top returns. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Pat.\nPat Yarrington: Let me close this out here on Slide 15. I would like to reiterate some of our key messages from our recent security analyst meeting and to demonstrate how we\u2019re delivering on those commitments. First, our cash generation improvement trend continues and is in line with previous guidance. In the first quarter, 2018 cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, was $7.1 billion well in access of our cash capital expenditures and quarterly dividend commitments. Second, we are executing a disciplined C&E program, allocating capital to the highest return projects that compete in our portfolio. Third, we grew production by 4.5% from full year 2017 to 2.85 million barrels a day, achieving an all time quarter high for the company and trending well within the guidance. Fourth, we have an advanced portfolio in the Permian Basin that is delivering on all cylinders. Year-over-year, we added the 100,000 barrels per day of shale and tight production here, trending ahead of recent guidance. And we\u2019re leveraging our mid stream business to maximize returns on every molecules. And lastly but very importantly, we increase the dividend per share by 4%, delivering on our number one financial priority to shareholders. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And Mark and I are now ready to take questions. Please keep in mind that we have a full queue and try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up if necessary. And we\u2019ll certainly do our best to try to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, go ahead and open the lines please.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.\nJason Gammel: Pat, really great quarter just in terms of demonstrating the cash generation potential that Chevron has moving forward. And so I guess we actually get to the high quality question about what you would potentially do with discretionary cash flow. In the capital programs, obviously, we\u2019re disciplined, it\u2019s within a fairly tight range, balance sheet is about where you want it to be that leads us to share buybacks. And what would you potentially need to see to begin a repurchase program?\nPat Yarrington: Jason, thanks for the question and thanks for acknowledging the good quarter. I think at this particular point in time, I\u2019m messaging around share repurchases really haven\u2019t changed from what we said just a few short six weeks or so ago. And at that time, we said we wanted to see the cash flow actually materialize. We said we wanted to see prices sustain a little bit. We do fundamentally believe that it is our fourth priority; and dividend growth is number one, leading the business is number two; the balance sheet, as you say, is number three; and surplus cash. Once we\u2019ve satisfied all those other commitments, it\u2019ll turn into a share repurchase program. It is part of the value proposition that we have offered shareholders in the past. As you know, 10 out of the last 14 years we have had share repurchases and we only stopped them during the financial crisis, and then in the last three years when prices there collapsed. So it's very much a part of the -- very much part of our thinking these days. And when we re-inaugurated if the circumstances permit that, we want to be able to do so in a sustainable fashion.\nJason Gammel: Maybe just as my follow for Mark. Mark you mentioned the debottlenecking at Gorgon and Wheatstone would be towards the low end of the cost curve in the LNG supply stack. Do you see anything else in the portfolio that would potentially be competitive? And I guess I might even be referring specifically to expansion trends at even one of those projects.\nMark Nelson: I think from Asia LNG perspective, the most exciting thing for us of course is the amount of demand that we\u2019re seeing in that part of the world. And it\u2019s probably premature for us to be thinking about extra trains as we have considerable opportunity moving from both ramp-up to debottlenecking. And having spent much of my career around refineries, I wouldn't underestimate the opportunity there and the size at the price. So we\u2019re focused on ramp up, efficient operation in the building our way into leveraging the existing infrastructure in Australia.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.\nPaul Cheng: I have two questions. I think that both of them for Mark. How much is the oil production from Permian that you are selling inside Permian in the first quarter? And what is your takeaway capacity for the next couple years? Have you already locked-in sufficient according to your current growth plan? And also we have heard some people talking about gas handling in the basin may start to become an issue. I want to see what is your view on that? So that's the first one. May as well have the second one is on the LNG market. Want to see whether you guys have been actively marketing or trying to market additional gas. And what's the conversation with the customer this day and what\u2019s the bid/ask differences, if there is any?\nMark Nelson: Thinking about and I\u2019ll answer -- I'll address your Permian takeaway capacity question at the high level as you can imagine. We\u2019re very comfortable with our off-take positions today, and it goes all the way back to that advantaged portfolio and maybe equally importantly, disciplined developments. So it allows us to keep up with our production. And we do that by partnering with our strong infrastructure companies and we get highly competitive rates. And then they execute on infrastructure projects that quite frankly might not compete in our portfolio and we view that as activating our value chain at the lowest possible capital investments, which is a written driven mentality. We will hit moments of tightness and length, but we like our position moving forward.\nPaul Cheng: How about the gas handling?\nMark Nelson: So from a gas perspective, all three streams so oil, gas and NGLs all must flow in the Permian. And as you know, the oil tends to drive the economics, but we have flow assurance across all three streams today. And again, we\u2019re comfortable with our position looking forward.\nPaul Cheng: But do you -- the basin as a whole will you have a problem, if not Chevron?\nMark Nelson: From a basin perspective, you certainly have -- as we\u2019ve all read the news, you can see some competitors who perhaps don\u2019t have either the same discipline or the same advantage portfolio experiencing problems. But in the Permian, in general, most of those would be temporary. We see that as a region that will solve those type of problems and only have temporal challenges. On your LNG marketing question, as you know, we\u2019ve chosen to do business with some of the largest most reliable customers in that part of the world, and we have long-term contracts. And those -- the natural discussions that go on about wanting reliability and the best sustainable price continues as we would have expected. So we\u2019re seeing customers continuing to like the reliability that we\u2019ve been able to deliver and our flexibility in helping them with some of their operating challenges. So from our perspective, we see those relationships remaining very strong.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nNeil Mehta: My first question is just related to cost inflation across the portfolio. If you're seeing early signs of cost increasing, any comment specifically international versus U.S.?\nPat Yarrington: I think that by enlarge the more material cost pressures that we have seen have been limited to the Permian and the U.S. unconventional market. The rest of the world, we\u2019re beginning to see some cost pressures but not of the same -- it\u2019s really as though future rates have declined and the rest of the world probably have stopped, and so you\u2019re probably leveling out there. So you\u2019re beginning to see a little tension there. Whereas in the Permian, you are actually beginning to see cost increases. I\u2019d like to take a moment though and acknowledge that we\u2019re largely protected in our Permian cost structure this year, because of the contracting strategies that we have followed. And this is again one of the benefits of having a 20 rig program that has been long planned and we\u2019re well disciplined around it. It\u2019s allowed us to line out all of the services and contract arrangements that we\u2019ve made it well in advance. And so we have about two thirds of our spending this year that\u2019s either occurring at known prices or indexed costs, or have cost containment capabilities built into them.\nNeil Mehta: And the follow-up question is just how do you get comfortable as a management team that the company has not under-investing, one of your peers is out taking a much more aggressive approach around capital spend over the next couple of years. And I guess one of the things that we hear when people push back on our view on the company is that the fear is that you\u2019re in harvest mode right now, but we\u2019re going to go into early next decade. And what are the projects that will drive the next wedge of ultimately cash flow growth enables you to replenish the portfolio and offset the decline. But just want you to respond to that narrative, because it\u2019s out there in the market.\nPat Yarrington: I think the primary thing that I would say is we\u2019re not after a volume growth for volume growth sake, we\u2019re after growing volume. And we have a tremendous portfolio here. We showed a slide back in March that had 40 years of 2P resource development opportunity, and is very attractive resource that can be developed at relatively modest capital investment program. So we feel very comfortable about the portfolio that we have. And individually, we've got line of sight in the unconventional growth between now and into 2022. And then in 2022, we see the TCOs -- the TCO WPMP FGP project first production coming online. So for the next several years, we\u2019ve got line of sight on very good growth and frankly a portfolio that allows growth beyond that.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: So I will take my two as well if I may Pat. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to open up with a buy back question again, just go back to that very quickly. Just philosophically, I'm guessing buybacks are not something you'd want to chop around quarter-to-quarter. So I guess my question is what level of -- what would management need to see to be comfortable to commence a buyback program, assuming you would need that to be ratable? And I'm thinking about level of cash on the balance sheet, whether quarter-to-quarter what we're seeing is a function of cash tax payments and interest charges and so on. At what point would you be comfortable to say okay, now we\u2019re ready to get going with this?\nPat Yarrington: I mean it\u2019s hard to -- I don\u2019t want to put a quantification on this at this point, because I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the internal thinking on this. But clearly, we would have to have sustainability in a view of surplus cash generation. Beyond $18 billion to $20 billion capital program that we want to fund, beyond the growth rate that we anticipate around dividend. And as you say, our balance sheet is hovering in a very reasonable price at the moment. So we have to have a view of sustainability. And when I say sustainability, I don\u2019t just mean this quarter to next quarter to may be the third quarter out, but I really mean over a series of year. So we would like to be able to average in, dollar average in the cost of that share repurchase program, because we do have some shareholders who are not in favor of share repurchases, because of the concept that you only do them when you have the cash available. And when you have the cash available, your stock price is high. So the way that we can mitigate that is by having a very sustainable share repurchase program. So it really comes down to the longer-term or I\u2019ll say medium term generation, cash generating capability of the firm and expectations around that.\nDoug Leggate: So I am guessing a dividend takes a priority as you\u2019ve said previously\u2026\nPat Yarrington: Absolutely.\nDoug Leggate: So my follow-up is just a quick one. Obviously, you had a tremendous quarter relative to what the Street was expecting. And when you look through the presentation, there is a couple of comments in there about liftings in other, both U.S. and international. Can you just talk a little bit about what that was? Because were there some favorable timing issues in terms of sales versus production? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: Yes, I mean actually for the first quarter, we were slightly under lifted. So I think it\u2019s just a variance between the position of this quarter versus the prior quarter, very modes stance. I think part of the earnings improvement or the earnings speed that you might be highlighting really relates to depreciation. And in particular if you recall back we had 155% reserve replacement ratio in 2017 and that obviously allows you to, as you go forward, to lower your DD&A rate per barrel.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Your question please.\nPhil Gresh: First question is a bit of a follow-up to Neil's just around the growth outlook through 2025. You do have some capital spending that will be rolling off after this year, Wheatstone and some other things. How do you think about where that wedge of -- assuming you're going to keep a CapEx cap in place through 2020 as promised. How do you think about where that extra cash flow might go between say adding more rigs in the Permian versus something like Gulf of Mexico where a peer of yours just sanctioned a project with $35 breakeven proposition?\nPat Yarrington: I think that we really feel good about sticking to the 20 rig program in the Permian. We think there\u2019s still opportunity to lower development costs, lower operating costs there and maximize revenue streams out of that, so that will be a primary area of focus for us, getting really good efficiency out of that particular asset. If I think about other areas where there could be small incremental money spent, it would really be around the appraisal and pre fees, pre engineering work perhaps in the Gulf of Mexico. We have four potential areas of interest there and/or the areas of potential interest I guess I should say, Anchor, Tigris, Ballymore and Whale, and so that would be areas where we would look to do further evaluation. I should also mention that the development activity around other shales other than Permian, so in the Marcellus and Kaybob Duvernay, in Vaca Muerta, that could like -- those areas could likely pick up additional capital investment.\nPhil Gresh: And just one question on\u2026\nPat Yarrington: Can I just go back and mention one thing with regard to deepwater, so that people got misinterpret what I am saying here. We do have multiple opportunities that we can evaluate, but we would be very disciplined and very ratable be working on the pacing of any sort of development that we would do there.\nPhil Gresh: So the commitment to the $20 billion cap. Just one question on the quarter. One of your peers on cash flows reported a flip in their deferred tax from a headwind to a tailwind at these higher price levels. I was just wondering, you mentioned $1 billion headwind in the quarter from affiliates' earnings versus distributions, which is about half of the headwind you're expecting for the entire year. Just curious if deferred tax played out as you expected.\nPat Yarrington: I would say directionally deferred tax played out as we were expecting. We did have -- it is influence as you might expect, rather timing of when you place out this as service and when you get bonus depreciation. In regard to the overall set of headwinds, I had given guidance back in March of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion as the headwinds for the year. But I had said at the time that if we felt working capital would be nil, I would say if prices hold where they are today, there will be a little bit of a penalty in working capital as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So you may want to think towards the -- certainly activity trending towards the higher end of that range that I gave you. I will say this is very hard for us to predict though, and so I do want to reserve the right every quarter to come back and give you an update.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber from Simons and Company. Your question please.\nGuy Baber: Pat, I wanted to stick on the cash flow here a little bit, but the $7.1 billion in pre-work working capital cash flow seemed to be better than the framework you all gave at the Analyst Day when we adjust for commodity price. And I understand that 1Q is typically weaker given downstream seasonality and the affiliate dividend timing. So I just wanted to confirm that outperformance versus the internal plan. And I was wondering if you could isolate some of the key drivers of that better than expected cash flow. What sticks out to you all internally? And then with Brent at these higher levels here, just as a check. Do the general sensitivities you all have given still hold or do we need to rethink those a little bit?\nPat Yarrington: Guy, I\u2019d say that the first quarter was really a very clean quarter, and it\u2019s a good basis I would say for you to build into your models going forward. I think we are running a little bit ahead perhaps on the guidance that we gave. I think first quarter is a good benchmark for you there. And the sensitivity that we had given from where dollar of improvement Bren on earnings, on cash flow is about 450 -- on earnings it\u2019s a little less than that.\nGuy Baber: And then I had a follow-up for Mark. So appreciate the view on the macro oil landscape here. Can you just talk a little bit maybe about what your base case expectations are from a high level. When you think about this decline in long cycle capital investment that's taken place for the industry over the last few years? So from 2013 to 2018, we've tallied up about 2 million barrels a day of major project capacity that started up per year on average and then that drops to around only 1 million barrels a day from 2019 to 2022 or so. So is the Chevron view -- do you see something similar? Do you see a supply gap emerging for the industry on the oil side over the next few years? And when might you see that beginning to show up in supply/demand balances?\nMark Nelson: So first from a short-term perspective, obviously, we hit a space where the markets rebalanced and that's on the back of some fairly solid demand; in fact demand has surprised folks, most folks to the upside; and effective curtailment or planned or unplanned declines in certain countries around the world on top of geopolitics. So that\u2019s all short-term price support for today. We\u2019re not designing our business on these prices. We\u2019re driving our business for a lower for longer assumptions. And I think we\u2019re coming from a time where we\u2019re practiced at production coming from large investments versus short cycle activities. And as an industry, we do not forecast that, as well as we do the large projects. So we have a perpetual supply that\u2019s the industries that we\u2019re in. But I would expect prices to stay in a fairly tight range over time and we\u2019re going to design our business to deal with the lower end of those assumptions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please.\nBlake Fernandez: Pat, I wanted to go back -- you had mentioned the equity affiliate headwinds, and you\u2019ve addressed that. I guess what I was thinking specifically is on TCO. Is there an oil price level that you would actually begin to start getting distribution from that?\nPat Yarrington: Actually Blake, we do still get distributions. It really is a determination that\u2019s made by the partnership council. It is not solely was in Chevron\u2019s control; but the partnership council folks; take a look at what are the requirements for funding the project that\u2019s under development; they take a look at what cash generation has been; they take a look at what the partners dividend interests are, and will negotiate basically to dividend declaration; and they can do that -- they review that multiple times during the course of the year; and they can do one dividend a year; and they can do a couple dividends a year, it\u2019s really the partnership council.\nBlake Fernandez: So it sounds like there is some flexibility and potentially could increase depending on what oil prices do?\nPat Yarrington: Theirs is, we had a dividend last year, expectations are for a dividend this year as well. Again, it\u2019s not anything that we control uniquely within Chevron.\nBlake Fernandez: The second question, I'll just take advantage of Mark being on the call. But the 25,000 acres in the Permian that were transacted, it sounds like it was a swap. So I just wanted to confirm that your acreage position hasn't really changed overall. But I guess I was under the impression that a lot of those transactions had already come to fruition and you all were done. So are you still in the process of marketing and coring up?\nMark Nelson: So you\u2019re right, there\u2019s mostly swaps were discussed in the materials that you saw, and never done, would be my answer in regard to potentially looking for ways to get longer laterals in the marketplace. From our perspective, we won\u2019t stop looking and we believe that\u2019s created considerable value for that disciplined execution that we talked about. And in fact, I would expect more transactions in the future in this space.\nPat Yarrington: And I would just add. Swaps are often hard to put together just because you\u2019re trying to both parties optimize. So they may take a little bit longer duration to come to fruition.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nRyan Todd: Maybe a first quick one on the Permian, congrats on a great quarter, I think you guys may have blown out the Midland differential all by yourselves there. Can you talk a little bit about -- obviously, there are some timing issues here. But what drove some of the drivers of the particularly strong quarter-on-quarter performance in the Permian. Whether it was from particular areas, number of completions there, and how to think about the trajectory of that going forward?\nPat Yarrington: Ryan, basically we had a large increase in the quarter, because we put several wells on production at the very tail end of 2017. We also saw increased NOJV activity. And the last point that I would make is that there can be -- it can be lumpy, the production increases that we show can be lumpy. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily have you think that the increase from fourth to first quarter is something that would be repeatable or ratable necessarily.\nRyan Todd: And then maybe -- we haven't talked about IMO2020. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how you think about your relative positioning into it? And whether you would envision, or how you think about the attractiveness of any potential investments to take advantage of the situation.\nPat Yarrington: I think the short answer is really that Chevron\u2019s position is pretty well placed, we\u2019re well positioned. We have complex refineries and we produce more distillates than fuel oil. We don\u2019t really produce much fuel oil in the U.S. We do have some exposure there around Asia. But the situation we\u2019ve got from a refining capacity standpoint, as well as the fact that we\u2019ve got midstream and trading capacity that we can optimize over the course of what we think will be an unstable market here as this rationalizes out puts us we think in a pretty good position. It\u2019s a little hard to understand exactly what the impacts are. So we continue to monitor what the industry response is going to be and what the actions are going to be taken by the various parties there. It\u2019s an unusual regulation in the sense of there is no single actor that\u2019s tagged with compliance. So there's multiple ways that compliance can occur, it can occur on the part of the shippers or that can occur on the part of the refiners. So it\u2019s a little hard to understand exactly how compliance will take place.\nRyan Todd: But at this point, you guys wouldn't envision deploying any meaningful capital to the driven projects?\nPat Yarrington: No we would not.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nRoger Read: Jumping in since I've got you, Mark and Pat on here. As we think about your ability to capture whatever differential exists between the Gulf Coast and the Permian. How should we think about that as flowing through your business? The reason I'm asking, Pat, is thinking about is it a realization and so we'll see it in the upstream part there, or does it flow through somewhere else? Just trying to maybe head off at the past concerns that in coming quarters realizations could look weak, but the overall number is fine. So how does it flow through on your upstream business?\nPat Yarrington: It would come through the upstream, upstream realizations.\nRoger Read: So whether it\u2019s commercial pipeline or whatever other capture, it all stay in the upstream side?\nPat Yarrington: That\u2019s correct.\nRoger Read: And then switching gears just since you put the chart up there with the longer flatter supply curve, you\u2019ve talked a little bit earlier about some of the Gulf of Mexico deepwater opportunities. Price wise, it looks like deepwater non-OPEC would be in the money here. So how do you think about when you're comfortable moving forward with an FID as you complete your studies on those various projects?\nMark Nelson: So it\u2019s about priorities from our perspective in capital allocation. So the good news of having a portfolio that\u2019s so strong with the unconventional with short cycle high return investments, it makes all of the other projects, you have to compete to be brought forward. And I\u2019ve heard Jay Johnson say numerous times, the idea of changing outcomes and improving returns, and when you target a group of engineers on making a project have higher economics, it\u2019s amazing what can be developed for us to consider. But Pat, would you add to that?\nPat Yarrington: So I would just say, first opportunity we\u2019ve got obviously is infill drilling and keeping existing facilities fully loaded here. And to the extent that there is a deepwater, a new reservoir found that can tie to existing facilities, obviously the economics there would be stronger. But we\u2019re working to get the development cost of greenfield down significantly. So standardizing on surface facilities, design one build many, standardizing along with the industry on subsea kit. We\u2019re also in a mode here now where we would be designing the production facilities, perhaps not the peak production but for the best capital efficiency, so longer subsea laterals. There\u2019s just an awful lot that we think we can do in the deepwater area to continue to get development cost down. But we have to see that actually materialize before we would be in a position to take an FID. We have a number of opportunities that are being evaluated, I\u2019d say at this particular point in time. And I can\u2019t really say which one is going to rise to the top first. But it\u2019s nice to have activity underway there and we\u2019re making good progress.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP Paribas. Your question please.\nTheepan Jothilingam: Just one question actually, coming back to the LNG performance. Could you talk about, just in terms of production both at Wheatstone and Gorgon, how sustainable is it to produce above that nameplate capacity? And just a follow-up question to that would be. Could you remind us in terms of the volumes from those two projects? Is all of it on long-term contracts or have there been some opportunities to, let's say, optimize some of that volume through pricing arbitrage? Thank you.\nPat Yarrington: I would say, we have been spending time and effort and taking these pick stops in order to improve the reliability. For example, at Gorgon, we do think there\u2019s opportunities over time to expand capacity through debottlenecks and gain more capacity and gain more efficiency. So we\u2019re willing to make investments now to get to certain reliability and efficiency today. Longer term I think those debottlenecking activity that will be available to us. And in terms of the contracts, on Gorgon and Wheatstone, we\u2019re about 90% committed under long term contracts for those.\nTheepan Jothilingam: Was it particularly good quarter in terms of that remaining 10% or other charge or trading profit\u2026\nPat Yarrington: No, it was a good quarter. In terms of the spot cargoes, Asian spot prices on average were about $10 and so it was a very good quarter from a spot standpoint.\nMark Nelson: So remember, that\u2019s only 10% of our production.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Cowen and Company. Your question please.\nSam Margolin: Frank, I know you like to keep the call tight, but I would be remiss if I didn't say thanks and congrats as well. And my first question is just a mechanics question around the affiliates. I recall in the past some conversations that there would be a co-lending program that would functionally exclude affiliate spending from what we might think about as operating cash flow. Is that still a factor or has the Chevron level found more efficient uses of capital than that?\nPat Yarrington: So the co-lending is really specific to the Tengiz project, and we have coal lending previously. Right now through 2019, we have had no requirement for any c-lending. With prices where they are today and if they stay at this level, it\u2019s not clear whether there\u2019ll be a co-lending requirement in 2018. It\u2019s something you should always have in the back of your mind. But with prices at this level, maybe that\u2019s something that won\u2019t materialize for 2018. The point of the co-lending, obviously, this project was inaugurated back in the lower price environment. And the point of the co-lending was to be able to assure and allow the fact that all partners being able to fund their share of the project. So it really has been dependent upon what prices have been and the ramp up of spend on the project per se. 2018 and 2019 be the peak years of spending for TCOs and investment projects, but 2018 so far has certainly been into a strong price environment.\nSam Margolin: And then my follow-up is just, I guess it's for both Mark and Pat. The comments about thinking critically on Permian takeaway, I think resonate with the market, because it's come up among a lot of the independents. And given your view on LNG markets globally, how do you see U.S. LNG maybe playing a role, particularly with respect to the areas in the Permian more in the West Texas part of the Delaware basin that are a little gassier, if not is an operator, maybe as a partner or a customer of that solution?\nMark Nelson: Well, from a macro perspective. Obviously, you'll see the company start to -- given some of the length that will occur in the region, you'll start to see people consider further investments in the Gulf in. And the Gulf coast have to compete with landed prices in Australia or in Asia. And from our perspective, we\u2019ve got such an advantaged position taking care of that Asian growth from our base assets in Gorgon, in Wheatstone that we\u2019ll watch what others do. We certainly have other LNG options around the world but all of it has to compete with landed price in Asia.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Rob West from Redburn. Your question please.\nRob West: I'd like to go back to something you said earlier, Pat, which was about the surge in production in the Permian over the quarter. You attributed to more well completions. And the follow-up that put in my mind was can you say whether over the quarter you drew down your inventory of DUCs or whether they were still building. Just in terms of trying to assess the sustainability of that growth rate? That's the first one. I've got a follow-up. Thanks.\nPat Yarrington: I think there was a modest reduction in DUCs during the quarter. But you have to think about it as being modest.\nRob West: The second one is about Indonesia where I know you\u2019ve got an early stage gas project in the pipe. And one of your peers sanctioned a gas project that is this week I think, so topical. And I was wondering -- so I think that particular project you have, the holdup is really on license extensions. Is that right? If so, what's the timing on resolving those? And if it's not right, can you say anything about the other bottlenecks you still need to overcome there?\nPat Yarrington: It\u2019s a called the Gendalo-Gehem project. And we have a new development concept, or we\u2019re reworking I guess the development concept, is the best way to say it; trying to recapitalize; work has been underway on that effort for the last several months; in fact probably more than a year at just particular point in time. So work is progressing on that. But I would also say that the contract extension is also an element here. And we\u2019ve express -- we've deliver an expression of interest to the government of Indonesia with regard to extent of the concession. So we want to make sure that it\u2019s a long lift project and we want to make sure that the combination of the development contract as well as the fiscal terms gives us the high return project.\nRob West: Okay, thank you for those details.\nPat Yarrington: Okay, I think that closes us off here. I would like to thank everybody on the call today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron, and everyone\u2019s participation. Jonathan, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}], "2020": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-01-31 14:15:51", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead.\nWayne Borduin: Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber are on the call with me. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.\nMike Wirth: All right. Thanks, Wayne. Last March I laid out Chevron's strategy to win in any environment, focused on four elements that differentiate Chevron from its competitors; an advantaged portfolio; a resilience to price downside; the commitment to capital discipline; and a superior capacity to return cash to shareholders. And as we've done in the past, we delivered again in 2019. We generated over $27 billion in cash flow from operations. We executed our $20 billion capital program. We grew annual production to a record high. We continued to high-grade our portfolio and we further strengthened our industry-leading balance sheet. As a result, earlier this week, we increased the dividend by more than 8%, and we expect to sustain the increased share buyback rate of $5 billion per year going forward. And we did this despite the cost increase at TCO and the fourth quarter impairments, which Pierre will cover in just a minute. 2019 performance delivered on all four of our financial priorities, which I'll cover on the next slide. These priorities don't change. They've been the same for a long time. For two years in a row, we simultaneously increased our dividend, increased share repurchases, grew production and reduced debt. Not everyone can say this. You can see the sources and uses of cash on the slide, including the $13 billion returned to shareholders, nearly the same amount as our cash CapEx. 2019 was a good year and we intend to do even better. During our Analyst Day in March, we'll lay out our plans to further improve performance in order to continue to deliver superior returns to shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierre, who will discuss our 2019 financial results. Pierre?\nPierre Breber: Thanks Mike. Turning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter results included a net $9.2 billion charge in special items and a foreign exchange loss of $256 million. Excluding special items and FX, earnings were $2.8 billion or $1.49 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion. This is lower than the prior quarter in part due to higher taxes on repatriated cash, including the cash impact for the $430 million tax charge that was accrued in the third quarter. Total capital spending was $21 billion. This includes around $800 million of inorganic spend, which we don't budget primarily relating to the purchase of the Pasadena refinery and acquisition costs for exploration leases and additional working interest in El Trapial.\nMike Wirth: Okay. Thanks, Pierre. On Slide 11, we are maintaining our commitment to capital discipline. And in 2020 our capital budget will be flat for the third consecutive year. The stacked bar depicts our organic C&E budget of $20 billion, which includes more than $6 billion in expenditures by affiliates primarily TCO, CPChem and GS Caltex. In the 2020 budget, approximately $5 billion is allocated to our upstream base business, $4 billion to FGP/WPMP, another $4 billion to Permian development, $3 billion for downstream and chemicals and the remainder goes to other MCPs exploration and other projects. Chevron's capital program is unlike our peers. Our spend profile has low execution risk and is focused primarily on short cycle, high return investments that are expected to sustain and grow the enterprise for many years to come. Slide 12 shows our production outlook for this year, assuming a $60 Brent price. We expect production to be up to 3% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2020 asset sales. Our projected growth is largely driven by the Permian, partially offset by ordinary base declines and the effects of prior year asset sales. The range reflects key areas of uncertainty in our business as noted on the slide. After another year of record production in 2019, we expect a fourth consecutive year of production growth excluding the impact of potential 2020 asset sales.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks Mike. I'd like to remind everyone that we have our annual Security Analyst Meeting in New York in early March, where we will share more about our business performance, long-term strategies and five-year outlook. We're looking forward to seeing you there. For those not attending in person, it will also be available via live webcast. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. \nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nNeil Mehta: The first question and this might be one for you, Pierre, is cash flow in the quarter earnings looked good, cash flow a little light. It did seem like there were some one timers in there. So can you just spend some time talking about what some of those one-time items are and how should we think about that rolling off as we go into the next quarter?\nPierre Breber: Yes, thanks, Neil. So cash flow was a little light perhaps. In the third quarter, we did provide guidance that we expected to pay the taxes on the repatriated cash. So if you recall in the third quarter, we accrued in our P&L for that tax effect on repatriating cash, but the cash taxes weren\u2019t actually paid until the fourth quarter, when in fact, you saw the cash move. So you saw cash balances go down from over $10 billion to less than $6 billion at year-end. And then the second item I would cite for was lower affiliate dividends. So we have lower dividends from our Chemicals affiliates, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, and no TCO dividend in 2019. So at times in years past TCO - we received a dividend from TCO in the fourth quarter and we didn\u2019t have that last year.\nNeil Mehta: And the follow up is just on production guidance. Up to 3% in their number of variables that you called out there, but can you kind of talk a little bit more about how you think about volumes in 2020. What are some of the pluses and minuses that we should be focused on. And how should we think about - thinking about some of the timing of those elements recognizing that you\u2019re solving for - value over volumes?\nMike Wirth: Yes, Neil I\u2019ll take that one. We\u2019ve had, as I mentioned, three years of production growth of 7% I think two years ago, 4.5% last year, 5.5% without asset sales. We continue to be on a good, strong program in our upstream that\u2019s delivering volume growth. And as we said, up to 3% this year. The Permian is the biggest piece of that, and you can see over the course of 2019, what we delivered. And - what I would call full factory production mode right now in the Permian. And so, that machine continues to click along very well. Jay will talk more about that, including not only kind of the near-term view but lay out I think a little bit of a longer-term view for you in March. We\u2019ve got contributions from other shale and tight, where we continue to invest in both Canada and Argentina. And those are beginning to contribute, not at the same magnitude as the Permian, but certainly strong growth Gorgon and Wheatstone through improved reliability and addressing constraints and optimization within the LNG plants. So we\u2019ve got growth coming across a number of those.  And as you note there, we\u2019ve got some uncertainties on the PZ . It looks as if we will begin production there here at some point over the next few months. There\u2019s still some details being worked out on that, but that starts to come back in. Hard to say how things go in Venezuela really difficult to say right now. And then, the other one of course, is - non-operated joint ventures and we certainly have some expectations for activity there. How that trends with funding levels decisions by partners, et cetera. A little hard to predict, but look, we\u2019re going to, we expect to grow production again this year. As I said, setting aside if we do anything else with asset sales in the portfolio. And, fundamentally, the underlying drivers that we laid out last March, where we said a 3% to 4% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. Those drivers remain intact.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please?\nPhil Gresh: The first question here - some of your peers seem to be signaling a return trend in buybacks, need to protect balance sheets. Obviously, you\u2019ve talked about the strength of your balance sheet and willingness to continue the $5 billion buyback here in 2020 despite the big increase in the dividend earlier this week. So, as you look at that I mean, is there any reasonable scenario where you would think it would not make sense to do the buyback from a macro perspective.\nMike Wirth: Yes Phil, it\u2019s Mike. No change in our expectations there. We\u2019ve indicated we increased the buyback last year. If you look at our cash flow, you can see that we certainly can afford this, as Pierre mentioned. Debt came down again last year, and we have the capacity to see this through cycles, which is what our intent is and no change to that guidance at all.\nPierre Breber: Yes, and if I can just build off that and address Neil\u2019s question on fourth quarter cash flow, but if you look at full year cash flow, it was very strong. Again, we paid a higher 6% dividend per share in 2019 covered that. We fully funded our capital program and grew production as Mike said over 4%. We paid down more than $7 billion of debt. And in 2019, we bought back $4 billion of share. So, we\u2019re exiting the year confident in our ability to generate future cash. That was expressed with the 8.4% dividend increase and, again, this expectation of sustaining the buyback through the cycle.\nPhil Gresh: Mike, second question just to follow-up, would be it sounds like you\u2019ve been doubling down here on cost reduction efforts, and it\u2019s been a big focus for you recently. So it would be helpful if you could talk about what\u2019s been happening lately on that front. Do you see this as something that would be material to investors in terms of Chevron\u2019s ability to reduce costs in the upstream and/or downstream businesses in a way that we could see? Thanks.\nMike Wirth: Yes, Phil so I may sound like a broken record on this, but in a capital intensive business, capital discipline always matters. And in a commodity business, cost discipline always matters. We\u2019ve done a good job in taking costs out of our business over the last several years in response to the downturn we saw earlier last decade. You can never assume that you\u2019re done, when it comes to seeking efficiency and driving to an even more efficient cost structure. And so that is certainly my expectation as we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to do that. We\u2019ve taken cost out at the same time production has grown significantly over the last number of years. And so unit costs have come down dramatically and my expectation is we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to reduce both absolute costs and unit costs over time. In March, we\u2019ll lay out a little more specifically what some of our ambitions are on this, and the kinds of things you can expect to see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please?\nJason Gammel: Yes thanks very much, gentlemen another solid year in terms of execution in the Permian. I was hoping that you could address whether you still see the Permian as on target for being able to be essentially free cash flow positive. The capital budget picked up a small amount for 2020, and I know commodity prices have some influence there. But if you could just talk about what you\u2019re seeing?\nMike Wirth: Yes, Jason, the short answer to that is yes, we do. We fully expect to be cash flow positive in the Permian this year. We exited the fourth quarter with very strong production, if you look at the growth Q3 to Q4. And across all the metrics, we continue to see improved performance. We\u2019re getting more feet drilled per rig every year, lateral lengths are increasing, EURs continue to go up, development costs continue to come down. And we are becoming more efficient from both a capital and an operating cost standpoint. You put all that together with the royalty barrels and the benefit of the fee acreage that we hold, and the picture in the Permian looks as strong as it ever has. I mean, it just gets better.\nJason Gammel: And then just as a follow-up, and this may be something that you prefer to largely defer to March, but a lot of your European peers are putting a fairly significant amount of capital into businesses that they call low carbon, which generally look to be relatively low rate of return type of investments. Can you talk about within Chevron how you think about lowering the overall carbon footprint of your portfolio? And whether these are the types of investments that make sense for you?\nMike Wirth: So let me start with lowering our carbon footprint and then I\u2019ll come to investments, Jason. We absolutely are committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations. Last year, we announced two metrics tied to methane emissions in flaring that are driving significant changes in what we do. We have adopted two additional metrics which I expect to also be included in compensation related to carbon intensity of oil production and gas production. We are doing a lot of work around marginal abatement cost curves across our entire portfolio to look at the intersection of technology, investment and opportunity to reduce our carbon footprint. We\u2019re integrating renewables into our business in a much greater way with green power purchase agreements, feeding biofeedstocks in our refineries as soon as this year, and codeveloping renewable natural gas projects with dairy farmers, for instance. And then the final thing is, we are investing in technologies, looking for things that can scale up, that can provide solutions to these challenges. And this includes not only things like carbon capture from ambient air, but other things to try to decarbonize the more difficult sectors where energy intensity is high. Last thing I'll say is, just to remind you that we operate the largest on purpose carbon capture and storage project on the planet at Gorgon. And we have two of the trains running right now. The third will start up this year. That will, at full capacity, be sequestering 3.5 million to 4 million tons per year. So we're absolutely committed to finding ways to address the climate issue. When it comes to investments, it can be challenging because the returns, as you say, historically, have not been competitive with some of the other things that we invest in our portfolio. We're looking for ways to improve that and find things that we can invest in that would offer attractive returns for investors, also be good for the environment and, importantly, can scale. And this is a big challenge and we need things that we can do at scale. And so we continue to be committed to that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Your question please.\nJeanine Wai: I think just following up on that question. Last month, Mike, you were quoted by saying that companies wait until changes forced upon them fail. And we were just wondering, are those comments specifically related to the gas write-downs and Chevron's longer-term view on natural gas versus liquids? Or was it more broadly speaking to Chevron's strategy related to the LNG transition or else just something else?\nMike Wirth: Probably the final. The something else. And it really is, we need to continue to adapt and our Company has been around for more than 140 years. And we have reinvented ourselves many times over that period of time. We live in a world today with 7.5 billion people. 20 years from now, there will be more than 9 billion people on the planet. There's an expectation for a reduction in the impact of what we do. And at the same time, we need to support affordable, reliable, access to energy for a growing population and growing standard of living. Now we also have technology tools that are available today that we've never seen before. And so what we need to do is continue to evolve our culture, our applications of technology, our cost structure, our competitiveness and our discipline to be part of that equation for many, many decades into the future. And so my comments really are a message to our employees that we need to change. We need to evolve and it addresses all of the things that we've talked about. It addresses a more efficient and lower carbon intensity in our operations, but also calls for us to find ways to adopt new technologies and change the way we work in response to them.\nJeanine Wai: My second question is on the Gulf of Mexico and potential upside to medium-term growth there, especially post 2023. So with tiebacks to existing infrastructure there being very attractive from a rate of return perspective in the portfolio. Can you talk about any technology that you're working on that could potentially extend high back ranges? And then any update you might have on estimated resource that we can be excited about in terms of exploiting through existing facilities or infrastructure, given the continued focus on free cash flow?\nMike Wirth: Yes. So we've sanctioned projects at the end of the year, which is a greenfield project with Anchor at a much lower cost structure, both capital cost and operating cost than we've seen before. So I think when we find projects where that's the right answer, you'll continue to see us do that. And we've got a lot of exploration acreage out there and a good track record over time on exploration. But the concept of tiebacks, I think, is one that we need to continue to invest more in. We had a discovery last year with Hess as the operator called Esox, a low-cost, high return tieback, which actually will turn a 2019 discovery into 2020 first oil. It's about five miles away from tubular bells. We've been working on technology to extend subsea tiebacks and this includes longer distance pumping of fluids, compression and movement of liquids and the ability to avoid formation of hydrates and other things on the sea floor, pushing the range of tiebacks from the neighborhood of 30 miles out closer to 50 miles, and that really expands the opportunity set for us to use existing infrastructure to improve production. We're working on multi-phase subsea pumps and a number of these technologies. And so I think as we go forward, what you will see is an increased blend of tiebacks and use of existing infrastructure as well as the occasional large greenfield project that comes in. And things like Anchor, for instance, you've got an initial phase of development. And once that's in, that enables what we just - what I just described, which is these additional follow-on phases of development, which are much more economic. And I think technology just moves in one direction, and it really builds on my prior comments that we need to look for ways to use technology standardization and other approaches to make the deepwater even more economic, a lot of progress has been made on that, and I'm optimistic we'll see more in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nRoger Read: Guess, if we could, I've got kind of one that's maybe on the risk side question and one that's on the upside question. So with the good news first. You highlighted some of the things at a risk to 2020 production. But recent talk has been about restarting the neutral zone, you have a position there. And then I was curious where else we could see some upside in the portfolio in 2020? I mean, should we be thinking Permian? Or should we focus on some other portion of the operations?\nMike Wirth: So on the partition zone after several years of being shut down, there's been progress with an agreement between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. That memorandum of understanding has now been ratified by the Royal Court in the Kingdom and the parliament in Kuwait, and we're moving on to some administrative actions required to implement that. All of that suggests that we should resume work in the PZ this year. It's been shut in since May of 2015. And so we will be careful to ensure that any startup and resumption of activity is safe that we really focus on equipment integrity. And so it will be a careful restart and a gradual ramp. And so I think in terms of production this year, we're likely to see a start-up at some point and then some work before we begin a gradual ramp. So what that nets to is not a lot of impact this year. But if - it could be some positive upside. I think we'll see more of the ramp completed in 2021. We eventually will have to get some new rigs in there to begin drilling additional wells. And so, but it should be on a trend line over the next 18 months or so back towards something that looks like we saw before we shut down. In terms of other upside, the Permian has kind of continually surprised us to the upside, even as we raised expectations in the past. And so certainly, that is a possibility. I mentioned the other shale and tight and those also continue to really show strong improvement in terms of performance. And so I think those are some other areas where you could see production upside.\nRoger Read: And then for my bucket of cold water on you. We've seen global natural gas prices take quite a hit, obviously, fairly mild winter across. Northern hemisphere hasn't helped. But part of it is your own LNG facilities and everyone else continues to run better than expected? Are we seeing some start to run above nameplate capacity. And so as we think about gas in 2020, what - do you feel that if we look at North American forward curves, that's probably a pretty good indicator of the year ahead? Or is there a reason for optimism in one place or greater pessimism in another. Just sort of curious how that would fit into your outlook.\nMike Wirth: Overall, Roger, I think the market is, as you say, pretty tempered on gas pricing. And we have had a relatively mild winter, both in North America and in Asia. And forward markets reflect that inventory levels reflect that. We're not banking on a recovery in gas prices. We've got an under - we're underweight gas as a percentage of our portfolio versus others. And I'll remind you, we've got pretty good term contracting on our LNG with oil-linked pricing across a lot of our portfolio there. So from a relative weighting standpoint, we may not be quite as exposed. So maybe it was a bucket of cool water rather than ice water that you dumped on me there. But yeah, the markets are setting up, I think, to be pretty flattish. And that's why we've got to focus on self-help and things like cost, as I discussed earlier.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\nDoug Terreson: Mike, so in integrated oil, returns on capital have converged between the companies during the past decade or so, which suggests that competitive advantages may be converging, too. And on this point, while you guys had this mantra of disciplined, return-driven capital allocation and that's clearly the appropriate approach, at least in my view. My question is whether you think that historical advantages and project management, multinational experience, logical superiority, cost of capital, maybe leaving something out are still strong and defendable for Chevron. And if so, are there examples that underscore the strength of the advantages that you guys have. And on the other hand, are there areas of historical competitive advantage that you sense are being eroded and where you'll need to redeploy capital away from in the future.\nMike Wirth: Well, there's a lot in there, Doug. Number one, you're right. I think we have seen this convergence of returns in part by the last cycle we came through in high prices. We had a high cost structure. We had lot of investment across the industry, and we are now living in a world of more abundant supply and prices and returns reflect that with the capital sitting on the books of everybody. I do believe the advantages that have historically been associated with the companies like ours are still strong, and the project at Tengiz, while we wish that the execution was going better than it is and disappointed in the cost and schedule update, there are not many companies in the world that can do a project like that at all and so I think there are strong advantages there. Our sour gas handling capabilities, our heavy oil expertise continues to be of value, and as we get back to work in the PZ, we will be doing things there that very few other companies can do. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve been hanging in, in Venezuela, which has tremendous potential and our capability there to help over time develop that resource in a responsible way is something that is differentiated. So I think there\u2019s some historic capabilities that are differentiators. The other thing I would point to is portfolio, and certainly as we\u2019ve talked about many times, want belabor it, but our position in the Permian both from a size standpoint, a quality standpoint, the lack of relative lack of royalty given the fact that it\u2019s fee acreage and our experience with factory drilling, which is a capability that not everybody has, and we continue to see the benefits of that year after year, is another point of differentiation. So I still do believe there are areas that we do differentiate.\nA \u2013 Pierre Breber: And if I could build off Mike\u2019s answer there, look, we get, and I said in my prepared remarks, that our returns are too low and we\u2019re committed to improving them and we\u2019ll share more at our Analyst Day. But I\u2019ll also talk about cash flow. We talked about our strong cash flow in 2019 and call it whichever macro environment you want to call it weak or whatever but we\u2019re able to do all those things, increase the dividend, fund the capital program, grow production, reduce debt and sustain the buyback program. At our last Analyst Day we showed that over the next five years we\u2019re going to grow cash from ops. We said we\u2019re going to keep capital essentially flat. That means we\u2019re going to grow free cash flow and so I think one of the things that\u2019s not fully understood is that the capital efficiency of our program going forward is different than we\u2019ve seen in the past. So we\u2019re able to grow and sustain cash flows at lower capital than almost any time in the past and certainly better than our peers. And that\u2019s what enables us to do the kind of dividend increase that we announced a couple days ago, sustain a buyback program and still grow the enterprise for the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotia Bank. Your question, please.\nPaul Cheng: My idea. You did an impairment charge, which is quite large and obviously that means the decision made at the time some of the parameters did not work out. So what have we learned from this process, or this impairment and how your future M&A or project accession, the process has changed?\nMike Wirth: Yes, Paul, two of the big drivers of that charge were our Marcellus position, which is essentially mostly dry gas. We\u2019ve got a little bit of Utica but mostly dry gas, and also the Kitimat LNG project which is Canadian gas that is quite a ways away from the Kitimat site. And both of those, at the time those transactions were entered into, we and the world had a different view on natural gas. I think the Permian and unconventionals have really been a game-changer. You look at the prolific gas production in the United States today, the market conditions that we were talking about earlier with Roger, and we didn\u2019t see those things at the time. And so I do think there\u2019s a lesson about testing M&A ideas against scenarios that are not the then-prevailing view on forward markets. We did that with the Anadarko transaction last year, and there\u2019s a reason that we \u2013 we like Anadarko from a synergy standpoint. There\u2019s a reason we saw a certain value level that we would be willing to transact at and there\u2019s a reason we wouldn\u2019t go beyond that. And that\u2019s because commodity markets are hard to predict, and we certainly looked at cases that would have stressed an acquisition because we might experience a different market environment than the one that we premised maybe our central analysis on. And so Yogi Berra said predictions \u2013 I think it\u2019s Yogi Berra predictions are hard, especially when they\u2019re about the future. That\u2019s certainly true. It\u2019s not lost on us, and I would say that\u2019s the big lesson from these two is if you\u2019re going into the future with \u2013 or into a deal with a pretty strong view on commodity price, make sure you take a look at what happens if you\u2019re wrong and whether or not you\u2019ll be happy with it in the scenario where you are wrong.\nPaul Cheng: On the second question, I think Pierre already addressed someone, I mean return on capital employed. Last year, you earned 7% at a $64 Brent price, which is lower than the SMP market return, I think. And that for most of the investors, they probably think $60, $65 Brent is as much as they\u2019re willing to give companies into long-term assumption. So you\u2019re talking about a improvement. Can you give us some idea that where \u2013 given the big portfolio you have, I mean, where that you see the biggest opportunity you may be able to really drive up that return. I mean, we\u2019re looking at some of the project, whether it is Tengiz, the Future Growth Project or the Anchor; we don\u2019t see those projects would be able to improve your overall return at all.\nMike Wirth: Yes, Paul, look there\u2019s no silver bullet on improving returns in a flat commodity price environment. You roll up your sleeves and you get to work on all the little things that cumulatively can drive returns higher. And that\u2019s costs, that\u2019s margins, that\u2019s value chain optimization, it\u2019s reliability, it\u2019s technology. There\u2019s a whole host of levers that you have to be working on. This is what we do in the downstream business every day and what we\u2019ve done in the downstream business for decades is you assume margins are going to be worse in the future than they are today, and you\u2019ve got to find a way to get more efficient and productive with your operations in every little thing that you do. And that\u2019s what we need to do. I\u2019m not satisfied with returns at the level that they are. We\u2019re not going to wait for prices to be the answer here. We simply have to \u2013 we have to get after it, and you\u2019ll hear more about this in March. We\u2019ll talk more about our plans to improve returns then, but there\u2019s not a magic wand here. This is good old-fashioned hard work, and it\u2019s things that we know how to do; we just have to get after it.\nA \u2013 Pierre Breber: Yes, let me just add in addition to the cost and margin and value chain and all those efforts, the Permian investments are very accretive to our book returns. We showed in the second quarter that even in a growing asset, and we are investing and growing in the Permian that returns are heading to 20% and north of that. So we do have investments that are accretive to the portfolio. I just said earlier, we have some really capital efficiency that enables us to sustain and grow the enterprise at lower capital levels than we have in the past. So when you take the capital efficiency plus all everything Mike talked about, we intend to increase our returns over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Your question, please?\nJason Gabelman: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess this follows what Paul just said. Specifically on Anchor, it seemed like CapEx for the project was a bit high. And I was wondering if you could talk about returns. You\u2019ve kind of danced around it, but maybe talk about returns specifically for that project. And is that kind of one of the more competitive projects in your project queue, and I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nMike Wirth: Yes, Jason. If I go back to an earlier period of time, our development costs for deepwater projects were north of $30 a barrel. Anchor is actually south of $20 a barrel. And that includes some investment for new technology that we have to prove out here because we\u2019re dealing with deeper reservoir, higher reservoir pressures \u2013 so 20,000 pounds technology. A little bit of additional export pipeline, which is unique to this project as well. Operating costs have come down from the high teens per barrel down into the range close to $10 a barrel. So we\u2019ve seen significant improvements in drilling and completions performance. And all of those things come together to bring the cost down. I\u2019m not going to give you a specific return number, because frankly, we run these things at different prices and different assumptions around recovery. So we look at a range of potential outcomes. But I will tell you, it is competitive in our portfolio. It sets us up for additional follow-on development that will, I think, improve returns. And the technology development unlocks a resource type that we believe holds a lot of potential as we go forward. And so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re done in terms of driving these costs down. And in the deepwater, we\u2019re going to continue to look to make these projects even more economic.\nJason Gabelman: When you say unlock a new resource type, is it kind of a high pressure, high temperature, more further? Yeah\nMike Wirth: Correct.\nJason Gabelman: And then there\u2019s not a lot of visibility to your project queue beyond 2025. There\u2019s a couple of Gulf of Mexico projects per Permian and TCO, and that\u2019s kind of all you\u2019ve given us. I wonder if you plan on providing more visibility to some of your projects that you have options around. And then kind of attached to that, do you see an opportunity to step into some international projects, maybe with companies that are looking to farm down stakes? Thanks.\nMike Wirth: Yes, so we will in March lay out a longer view to give you some more transparency. I know that\u2019s a question that a number of people have been asking. The one thing that I would suggest is we went through a period of time over the last decade where I think we conditioned ourselves and our investors to believe that the only path to the future was by doing these great big projects and stacking up lots and lots of them, because that\u2019s what we were doing at the time. We have a very different portfolio today. We have large traunches of production that are pretty flat and facility-limited in Australia LNG and Kazakhstan. Our unconventionals begin to behave this way as you build up the scale there.  And so at the margin, we continue to look for the right projects and highly-economic projects as it appears that those that are accretive to returns. But we\u2019re not nearly as reliant on those alone to sustain and grow cashflows into the future. We just have a much more resilient, durable, long-lived portfolio. And so grinding away on enormous unconventional positions may not be quite as glamorous as doing the big projects in terms of giving you a lot of things to talk about, but it really drives strong financial outcomes. And it\u2019s durable, I think, longer than most people believe. And so we\u2019ll talk about that more in March. We\u2019ll talk about other opportunities we have in terms of captured opportunities that people may not be paying much attention to. We\u2019ll talk more about our exploration prospects. And the question on farm-ins, that\u2019s always something we evaluate, and if the right opportunities present themselves, we look at those.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC. Your question, please?\nBiraj Borkhataria: The first one is actually just on the base decline. If I look at the figures on slide 8 and take the base from there, it looks like the base decline was less than 1% in 2019. And I guess that excludes shales, but I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of whether that figure is relevant and if there\u2019s anything funny in the 2019 number that is not applicable going forward. Just some comments around that would be helpful.\nMike Wirth: I mean, our base portfolio was large and there\u2019s a lot of different assets in there. There are some things that now are in the base that are things like Jack/St. Malo and Perdito, and so we\u2019ve got some of these deepwater projects that are all on our new projects. Some of the new investments in there to do next phases of development and the like give you some growth that offsets some of the underlying decline, but it also comes back to this point I was just making to Jason, and a larger percent of our portfolio now is facility limited, not reservoir limited, and so this mental model that reservoir dynamics drive our overall production, the shape of our production profile is one I think that needs to be calibrated appropriately to a larger and larger portion that does not behave that way. So that results in more stable, predictable production. There\u2019s modest investment required to sustain that, be it facility investment or some new wells. But you look at that, you look at the brownfield opportunities we have, and the ways we\u2019re using technology to arrest declines, and base decline is just less in our portfolio than it was a decade ago, and that\u2019s not a short-term phenomenon. That\u2019s a structural change in how our production looks.\nBiraj Borkhataria: That\u2019s helpful.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Biraj. Do you have a follow up?\nBiraj Borkhataria: Yes, the second question is just on a slightly different tact, but as you guys sit in California, I wanted to ask about renewable fuels, given the favorable regulation there. So what we\u2019re seeing is a number of the U.S. refiners announce expansion projects in renewable diesel in particular. I was wondering if that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in. What do you think about the economics? And then, if it\u2019s attractive to you, what\u2019s holding you back from investing in that space?\nMike Wirth: Well, we\u2019ve been selling renewable fuels in California for the better part of the last two decades. A lot of blending. We\u2019ve been looking at manufacturing, but we really have chosen not to go into the ethanol business. On renewable diesel, we\u2019ve got close relationships with suppliers of renewable diesel, and we are, I mentioned earlier in a response to a question, we are making modifications at California refining facilities in order to co-feed biofeedstocks in order to produce renewable diesel. So our view is rather than going into new projects and greenfield developments, we\u2019ve got existing infrastructure and kit that we have now proven the way to safely and reliably introduce biofeedstocks and co-feed. So it\u2019s a more economic way to do it. It takes advantage of existing capital investment, and so we\u2019re working on that. So we are and will continue to be growing in the biofuels value chain.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Mike and the guys, happy New Year to all of you. Mike, I wonder if I could just hit we\u2019ve had some concerns about this particular issue for a second, and it\u2019s the Permian. I\u2019d like to just get your perspective on it. I realize what you\u2019re saying about returns and the benefit of royalty interests and mineral interests and so on, but by 2023, this is going to be 25% of the company, and when I think about the underlying decline rates and the skew towards NGLs and gas given the state of the U.S. gas market, help me understand why the increase of the putting not much of your portfolio on high decline assets and skewing toward U.S. gas is incrementally positive for the overall cash flow capacity of the company.\nMike Wirth: Doug, so look, an individual well is a high decline asset. The Permian Basin, as you add hundreds and then thousands of wells on production and you have infrastructure built, the ability to keep that infrastructure full and have it be a very flat production profile at modest incremental investment relative to the production that you\u2019re producing is profound. Jay will explain this more in March when we come to New York, but it is a factory, and running a factory, you\u2019ve got certain costs and certain investments in the factory and then you push out the product or the factory, and that\u2019s how to think about the Permian. The commodity mix, look, it\u2019s 75% liquids. We\u2019re 50% oil in our portfolio right now, 25% NGLs, 25% gas. As the volumes continue to grow, we get a lot of oil production and we take a long view on markets. Pierre mentioned earlier that returns on investment there are greater than 20% and growing. And so look, if we\u2019ve got something that somebody mentioned earlier your current returns are 7%, those need to improve. Well if you\u2019ve got opportunities to invest in things that are north of 20 that\u2019s a way to start to lever up returns. And so look, we look at the commodity prices on it all, we optimize it. We\u2019re moving commodities to markets near and far to add value to that but these are high return, long lived positions and it is a competitive advantage.\nDoug Leggate: I look forward to what Jay has to say in March but just to be clear, those returns are full cycle including infrastructure and all of the plant build out and so on?\nMike Wirth: And fully loaded with costs including corporate costs.\nDoug Leggate: My follow up, Mike, is more philosophical I guess for the broader energy space. All we all seem to be, it seems like there\u2019s been a kind of an awakening if you like to ESG issues just in this last past six months and particularly this year. More headlines this morning about pension funds just divesting out of fossil fuels altogether. I\u2019m just curious how in your position obviously as an advocate of the industry, how do you anticipate challenging those kind of questions over fossil fuels, everything else good kind of thing? How does Chevron compete for the incremental investment dollar? And it\u2019s an answer I\u2019m looking for some help with because obviously it\u2019s a challenge role for all of us in this business right now.\nMike Wirth: Yes, well first of all we believe in ESG. We have been a responsible operator across ES&G for a long, long, long time and we invest enormously in that. The E is getting a lot of attention right now and look, over the history of our industry, we have, we and others have reduced the environmental impact of our operations time and time and time again. We are doing it again today, and we have the scale, the technical capability, the financial capability, to be a big part of addressing this challenge. And no one country, no one industry is going to be the one that solves everything, but collectively, we will respond to the challenge. The world needs more energy. The world needs more affordable energy and people in developing economies deserve the opportunity to see their lives improve and affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy is essential to improving the quality of life on the planet, which is better today than it has ever been at any point in history, and will be better in the future. And we intend to be a part of that solution. We acknowledge that the climate is changing. We acknowledge that human activity and fossil fuels contribute to that. And we acknowledge that we will be part of addressing that as we go forward. And so we are investing time, people, money, technology in being part of that solution. And look, I\u2019m an optimist. There\u2019s a lot of pessimism that you can hear out there. And as you say over maybe the last six months that drumbeat is even louder. But we\u2019ve solved big challenges in the past, and I\u2019m optimistic that we will be successful again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citibank. Your question please.\nAlastair Syme: With the impairment, I guess you\u2019re signaling something about LNG. So the question is are you happy to tack away completely from LNG? I mean, you\u2019ve been one of the biggest global investors in the last decade and clearly created a lot of competency within the organization. So are you happy to do nothing in effect?\nMike Wirth: No, we\u2019re happy to do things that are competitive and economic, Alastair. And look, we\u2019re a big player in LNG. The demand for LNG will grow over time and you have to take a long view on these things. Commodity markets get into positions where they get over built, demand grows in linear fashion, supply comes on in stair steps. And so we\u2019re in a position right now where the near-term market fundamentals are a bit tough but long-term, like petrochemicals, like refining, you need to be in low-cost positions that are highly competitive where you\u2019ve got scale, technology, operating efficiency. And so those are the kinds of things we\u2019re looking for and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities to add to our LNG portfolio. Our assessment on the Kitimat project is, given all the other investments out there in the world that, that one was going to be tough to compete versus our alternatives. And so it\u2019s a hard decision to come to, but it doesn\u2019t condemn the asset class for us as an investment proposition. We just want to find the very best projects.\nAlastair Syme: My follow-on, I just wanted to get an update on where you\u2019re at in TCO; specifically, any discussions you\u2019re having with the government. I\u2019m not sure where the government\u2019s been sort of informed on the cost overruns and where that leaves it?\nMike Wirth: Yes, so the discussions are ongoing. The government\u2019s obviously key stakeholder in this, and so our people in-country have been engaged. Jay Johnson will be there next week, and both visiting the site and meeting with people from the government. And so when you go through one of these things, there\u2019s a whole series of engagements and we\u2019re in the process on that.\nPierre Breber: Yes, the only thing I\u2019d add to that, Alastair, is that unlike other agreements in Kazakhstan, our contract\u2019s tax and royalty, right. It\u2019s not a production-sharing contract. So in production-sharing contracts, the government reimburses the concessionaires for their cost which is not the case for tax and royalty. So of course, they\u2019re an important stakeholder but it is a fundamentally different contractual structure.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Jamaal Dardar from Tudor Pickering. Your question, please?\nJamaal Dardar: Just wanted to touch on the outsize dividend growth that we saw versus previous years here. So just curious on the thought process there. And as you continue to shed assets and large MCPs roll-off and capital intensity is lowered, just wondering how repeatable outsize dividend growth could be over the long-term?\nMike Wirth: So if you look back at our dividend history \u2013 and we were looking back at it not long ago \u2013 whether you\u2019re looking over multiple decades or over the last decade, we\u2019ve grown at kind of a compound annual growth rate of about 6%. And so this is a little bit to the upside of that, but we\u2019ve been lower than that here in recent years and we\u2019re well positioned. Pierre talked about our strong cash flow and the capital efficiency that we have now in our portfolio to sustain and grow cash flows with a much lower level of capital investment than I think people have become accustomed to over the prior-period. We would not have increased the dividend if we weren\u2019t absolutely confident that it\u2019s sustainable in perpetuity. And just as we said, we intend to sustain our buybacks through the cycle. We intend to sustain strong dividend distributions. Our number one financial priority, I\u2019ll remind you, is to sustain and grow the dividend. And so this was a signal of confidence in our portfolio. It\u2019s a signal of confidence that we can sustain strong cash generation, even in a commodity price environment like the one we\u2019ve been in and the one we continue to be in. And we will talk about this more in March, but we have a very, very strong position to generate cash out of our portfolio, very efficient capital profile going forward, further efficiencies coming on the cost side, and we\u2019re very confident in the capacity that we have. Decisions are made by the board. I can\u2019t get ahead of the board on what they may do in the future. But I\u2019ll tell you, the board shares the confidence we have in our cash generating capacity.\nJamaal Dardar: And then just a quick one on the buybacks. You mentioned the sustainable nature. It\u2019s difficult for us to model the impact of the PSC roll-off, but it seems very temporarily there could be at strip pricing, time periods where in order to satisfy the full buyback, maybe you lean into the balance sheet there. Just wanted to verify the comfort there; obviously, given where you sit as best of class on your debt ratio?\nMike Wirth: Yes, thanks, Jamaal. No - yes, if we have to lean on the balance sheet for some point in time, that\u2019s okay, right? We\u2019ve said we want to sustain it through-the-cycle. We\u2019ve never said the buyback has to be funded every single quarter from free cash flow. So that\u2019s not our expectation. We have the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Our net-debt ratio is 13%; gross debt is 16%. We have the capability to take on some debt. I\u2019ve talked about we don\u2019t have a target debt range. But certainly, I\u2019d be comfortable higher than we are right now. But if we\u2019re outside of, if we\u2019re a little bit low, that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s how the math works. So if we generate cash at surplus to our top three priorities, which is to pay the dividend, invest in the business, and have a strong balance sheet. And we\u2019ll return that in the form of share buybacks.  But we also want to keep that ratable and sustainable, so we just don\u2019t want to ramp-up buybacks because we want to be able to essentially dollar cost average and do it through the cycle. So the short answer is yes. There will be times we\u2019ll lean on our balance sheet. Our balance sheet has that capability. And our intent is to sustain the buyback through the cycle.\nMike Wirth: Thank, Jamaal. Well, with that, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone\u2019s participation on today\u2019s call. Jonathan, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-11-01 15:04:04", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead.\nWayne Borduin: Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s third quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Turning to slide 3. And Pierre?\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Wayne. We had another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. First, an overview of our financial results: Earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.36 per share. The quarter's results included a $430 million special item tax accrual associated with a cash repatriation in the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange gains for the quarter were $74 million. Excluding special items and FX gains, earnings were $2.9 billion or $1.55 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations was $7.8 billion. We also maintained a strong balance sheet with a low debt ratio. Importantly, our strong cash flow allowed us to continue to deliver significant cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we paid over $2 billion in dividends and repurchased $1.25 billion of shares, in line with our annual share repurchase run rate guidance of $5 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned approximately $9.5 billion in dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date organic CapEx was $14.5 billion, slightly below our ratable budget of $15 billion. Total CapEx, which includes inorganic transactions that are unbudgeted, totaled $15 billion. We are maintaining a firm commitment to capital discipline to improve returns on capital. Turning to slide 4. Third quarter cash flow was strong, down from the prior quarter due to lower Brent prices and the absence of the termination fee received from Anadarko. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of nearly $22 billion funded all four of our financial priorities. With nearly $12 billion in free cash flow, we currently have an annualized yield of about 7%, highlighting our ability to generate strong free cash flow in a lower oil price environment. Through the three quarters, the company's cash flow dividend breakeven price, excluding working capital is in the low 50s Brent. Asset sales proceeds add to our positive cash flow and further lower the breakeven, while high-grading our portfolio. Since the beginning of 2018, asset sale proceeds have totaled $3 billion, and by year-end after the expected closing of the sale of our U.K. North Sea assets, we will be near the low end of our $5 billion to $10 billion guidance range with one year to go.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Pierre. On slide 7, third quarter oil equivalent production increased 3% compared to a year ago with higher shale and tight production in the Permian as well as higher production from major capital projects following the ramp-ups at Big Foot and Hebron. This growth was partly offset by unplanned downtime at Hibernia, asset sales, and the impact of Hurricane Barry in the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to slide 8. Third quarter production was strong at more than 3 million barrels a day for the fourth consecutive quarter despite the impact of planned turnarounds and asset sales. Year-to-date production, excluding asset sales, is about 5% higher than 2018, which is consistent with our earlier guidance of 4% to 7% as shown by the middle bar. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect production growth to be primarily driven by our shale and tight assets as well as the continued ramp-up of Hebron. Turning to slide 9. I'll provide an update on the TCO project. In the third quarter, we completed a detailed cost and schedule review of the future growth and wellhead pressure management project in Kazakhstan. As a result, the cost estimate for the project has been updated to $45.2 billion with an additional $1.3 billion in contingency. The expected start-up of FGP has shifted to mid-2023 and will now follow WPMP, which remains on schedule for startup in late 2022. The updated estimate has been submitted by TCO for shareholder approval.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Jay. And turning to slide 12, this quarter, there were a number of highlights related to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations. Earlier this month, we announced two new greenhouse gas reduction goals. The new goals are aimed at reducing our oil emission intensity by 5% to 10%, and our gas emission intensity by 2% to 5% in between the years of 2016 and 2023. These are in addition to the targets we set at the beginning of the year to reduce our flaring intensity and methane emissions over the same time period. In Australia, we started up the Gorgon CO2 injection project in early August and are in the process of ramping it up to full capacity. Once fully operational, this will be one of the world's largest carbon sequestration projects and is expected to reduce Gorgon's greenhouse gas emissions by about 40% over the life of the project. Lastly, construction is underway on a new 29-megawatt solar farm, which will supply electricity to Chevron's Lost Hills Field in California. Now looking ahead. In upstream, we expect full year 2019 production growth to be in the middle of the 4% to 7% range, excluding 2019 asset sales. Asset sales, primarily in Denmark and Brazil, are forecasted to have a full year impact near 30,000 barrels per day. Planned turnarounds, primarily in Gorgon and Nigeria, will be lower than the third quarter, but are expected to impact production in the fourth quarter by more than 70,000 barrels per day. As Jay mentioned earlier, we have acquired new exploration acreage in Brazil that is expected to add about $120 million in inorganic capital, which is unbudgeted. Full year TCO co-lending is expected to be below the full year guidance of $2 billion, dependent primarily on the fourth quarter distribution decision. In downstream, we expect high refinery turnaround activity. This includes a refinery-wide turnaround at SPRC in Thailand which occurs once every five years. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make the $430 million tax payment related to the cash repatriation and to repurchase shares of $1.25 billion. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Wayne.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines. \nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nJason Gammel: Thanks very much guys. I guess the first question related to the updated Tengiz budget. Given that a lot of the spending is already behind you, do you anticipate that this is going to have any significant effects on the co-lending that you'll be making to the venture in the coming years? And then maybe I'll just ask my second question now. The U.S. downstream earnings were pretty robust this quarter relative to what I would have expected just given a heavy turnaround schedule. Is it just the margin environment that was helping you out or is there anything else that's happening in downstream that is maybe more ratable?\nPierre Breber: All right. Thanks, Jason. This is Pierre. So, on co-lending, we'll provide guidance for 2020 next quarter, as we have in prior years. As you know, co-lending depends on three primary factors: the level of the capital spend, oil prices, the macro environment and any dividends. And I guided in the fourth quarter that we expect the full year for 2019 to be lower than our $2 billion, but it will vary depending on the fourth quarter dividend decision that TCO makes, so if the dividend is higher, the co-lending would be higher. If it's lower, the co-lending would be lower. So, if you go back to how this cost increase impacts co-lending, you really have to look at it as overall cash flow. So, clearly if you hold prices and dividends constant, higher capital costs will result in higher co-lending, but that does not translate to lower Chevron cash, because we're going to offset the increases in TCO elsewhere in our capital program. And so, if you remember, TCO capital spend is non-cash and co-lending turns part of it into cash because we think it's the most economic way to finance our share of the TCO spending. But again we're going to have offsets elsewhere in our capital program, which will be cash CapEx, and that will help offset that higher co-lending. If we go to Downstream in the quarter, we don't -- there's nothing that isn't inherent in the underlying margins that I can really point out to. We've had -- distillate margins have popped up a little bit, and we tend to have some more production in that space. You're seeing some of the effects of IMO are rolling through the system. I mean West Coast margins had some strength at times in the quarter, but I would attribute the third quarter performance largely to how we operated in the underlying margin environment.\nJason Gammel: Very clear. Thanks, Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Jason.\nOperator:\nPhil Gresh: Yes, hi good morning. First question, just coming back to the idea that the Tengiz CapEx increase will not affect the overall capital spending plan, is this -- are we just talking here about the fact that perhaps you're at low end of CapEx ranges and now you move to high end of CapEx ranges or how do you calibrate being able to offset $4 billion to $5 billion of incremental spending net to Chevron within the budget? Is it activity elsewhere or is it just within ranges here we're talking about? Thanks.\nJay Johnson: Phil, there's a couple of different places that we look to. First, TCO itself in its base capital spend has offset and will continue to offset some of the increase in the FGP spend. Beyond that though as Pierre was talking about, we have a much more flexible capital program now with a lot of short-cycle activity, and we're able to pace and adjust that program to fit within the investment levels that we set, and particularly as it relates to gas-related investments, there are opportunities for us in this current environment to scale back some of that as appropriate, and those are things we may have done anyway. And then the final thing is just the capital efficiency that we're driving throughout the business. Our base business performance has been very strong. We have digital initiatives trying to reduce our -- make our capital spend more effective. And so, right across the board, people are figuring out ways to do more with less. I'll give you a good example was in Bangladesh recently, where instead of making a major capital project to add some additional compression, the team was able to look at recompleting some wells, adding some perforations and doing some debottlenecking on existing facilities, which extended the production plateau and alleviated the need for incremental capital spend on another project. So, it's these types of spending that we constantly are working through as we allocate our capital each year. We're going to remain capital disciplined. We're going to stay within the ranges that we've given you, and we're going to look to do it while we stay focused on delivering the value and returns that are really what's driving our decisions.\nPierre Breber: And if I can just build off of Jay's answer there and just to be very specific. No, we do not intend to go from the low end to the high end of the range. We intend to find offsets through the way that Jay has talked about. We have a range because we're giving guidance out to 2023. It is a cyclical business. Oil prices can change, COGS can change. We have short-cycle capital that we can flex up or down, as Jay mentioned. So the intent of the range, we still want to keep the range for what it's there for, and our intent is to offset increase elsewhere.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, all right. Thank you for that color. And then, I guess, just a follow-up would be for Jay. I'm just trying to kind of rewind here back to a year or so ago, there were some fears that things were getting a bit behind in Tengiz and then back at the Analyst Day, the tone sounded much better that things were back on track. And now that we have a 25% increase, which is fairly sizable. So I'm just hoping you could provide a little bit more color about how these things have progressed to the point that we have this kind of increase? Thank you.\nJay Johnson: Yes. I think what's changed fundamentally is we completed a very detailed cost and schedule review in the third quarter. So that's just been completed. And as we looked at it, there were a couple of key elements. We've talked in the past about the overall engineering program, the cost of that program and the impact the engineering has had on fabrication and construction. And you can see those in the first two bars of page 9 -- slide 9. And that really reflects that accelerated consumption of contingency that we've talked about in the past. What was frankly a surprise was the increasing quantities that we're seeing coming out of the late stages of engineering, particularly related to things like the electrical and instrumentation, controls, fire and gas, some of the late changes in how we're going to do the backfill and quantities associated with it. Those drove a much higher construction costs than we had anticipated. And if you look at the third bar, you see that represented. The other big surprise was, having to delay the start-up of FGP by the year. This is really driven fundamentally by an assumption change. We had planned to integrate modules. Our estimate was based on the integration of the modules in FGP, each one taking about 12 months from the time it was placed on its foundation until it's fully integrated. While we're seeing very complete modules come from the fabrication yard, just as we've gotten a year of ME&I experienced this year, our view has changed that we're using 14 months as our planning basis, and that's pushed that schedule time out. So the growth in quantities and the longer schedule have really been the surprises that we didn't anticipate previously. So that's really where we are at this point in time.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, thanks a lot.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, thank you. So the first question just on the Permian and the glide path here. You continue to trend above your target levels. Can you just talk, Jay, with some detail about, how the plan is progressing in the Permian and any comments that you would have on sort of this upcoming U.S. election? And any impacts the way you think about prosecuting your acreage?\nJay Johnson: Well, I'll start with just the performance in the Permian. Our view, as you know, has been to be very disciplined and focused on returns and efficiency. And we have seen continued performance improvement in our drilling, in particular. Our completions have remained very strong throughout. And so we're watching every segment of the value chain from the actual land acquisition to fill in some of the checker boards and allow the longer laterals, right through the drilling efficiency, the -- into the completions, the facilities and on production. And then, working with our marketing and transportation group to ensure that we're getting the highest realizations we can for the products that we're producing. So we're on plan. We've actually, as we said, doing very well with our production profile. We're pleased with the performance that we're seeing, but we're always driving for better performance. In terms of the upcoming election, look, hydraulic fracturing has been done for millions of wells, not only in the U.S. but around the world. It's done safely. It's done effectively. We learn more about it all the time. And it's really unlocked an economic -- huge economic benefit for the country, as well as for the companies involved. It's also unlocked some environmental benefits in terms of the proliferation of gas, which isn't always to our benefit from a profit standpoint, but it's a great fuel for the U.S. If you look at it from our company standpoint, we have less than about 10% of our Permian unconventional acreage that is on federal land and all of that is in New Mexico. So from a relative standpoint, while we would not like to see any kind of restrictions on hydraulic fracturing it's -- that's the context for our company.\nNeil Mehta: No, that's great. Appreciate it. And then, the follow-up here is related to Brazil. There's the upcoming transfer of rights auction and you called out some of your increased exploration acreage there. Can you provide some context in terms of the way that Chevron thinks about Brazil and how aggressive it sees itself being there over the next couple of years?\nJay Johnson: Well, we've talked before that we are very happy actually with our existing resource base. We've been doing a lot of portfolio work, as you know, over the last several years to really clean up our portfolio. And part of that has been a reload of our exploration strategy. But because we're happy with our resource base, we have primarily focused on reloading in the exploration space, because we're looking for resource additions out in the future. And we also want to manage our capital over the period of time. So our focus has been on exploration opportunities. That's what you've seen us do in Brazil and our focus has been that way. We are interested in Brazil, because we see the pre-salt as a prolific hydrocarbon basin. It's a good place to be to increase the probability of success on exploration and we'll stay focused on that. We have a couple of wells coming up next year, which will be good wells for us. We're looking forward to seeing those results. But we'll continue to stay focused primarily on exploration, as we look forward. \nNeil Mehta: Thanks, guys. \nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Your question, please.\nPaul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nJay Johnson: Hi.\nPaul Cheng: Jay, don't want to beat the dead horse on Tengiz, but what have you learned from Tengiz in terms of \u2013 to further fine-tune your development and project execution process? Clearly, there something was not working in order for us that to have at this stage to have the delay for a year and also that for 25% increase. So what have we learned? \nJay Johnson: Well, Paul it's a good question. We ask our self all this time -- all the time, how can we do better? Clearly this is a disappointment. I'm very disappointed, because we have taken all the lessons learned from the past and try to make sure we're building those into each project as we go forward. When we think about what's gone well. There have been a lot of dimensions to this particularly the execution work is going very well. I'm happy with the way the fabrication work has gone in the yards. The modules are coming out very complete. And dimensionally accurate and we set them on their foundations everything is lining up. The logistics system has been flawless. The performance is exactly how we had planned and it's delivering modules to the site very effectively and we've been able to complete the sealift for 2019. So we're happy on all those fronts. The schedule delay is a disappointment and that has to do a lot with the quantity growth we saw in engineering. And as we've said, we've been unhappy with the overall engineering performance on this project. Not only the engineering costs themselves, but the impact it's had on fabrication and construction. We need to do better in this area. And it's an area that we're going to continue to learn our lessons from this and build it forward. We don't have any other very large mega projects like this that are land-based anywhere in the world at the current time. So we've got time to take these lessons learned and really think about how we approach this differently in the future. Our commitment remains on capital discipline. Our commitment remains to execute this project to the best of our ability. When you look at the improvements taking place on the ground in Tengiz, in 2018 we talked about productivity that we needed to improve and we saw a 40% to 50% improvement in the productivity across the site. In 2019, this year we've seen another 30% to 40% improvement in productivity. So we're seeing great improvements with the production, the construction management system, production management systems. And we're going to continue to stay focused on productivity, on completing work and moving it to mechanical completion and then getting it through systems completion and then to start-up.\nPierre Breber: Yeah. And if I could just build off of Jay's answer Paul. Just to put this in an enterprise perspective, the additional depreciation after tax to Chevron is less than $0.20 per share or less than the cash flow impact of $1 change in oil prices. So as Jay said, we own this and we need to do better. And trust me; we're fighting for every dollar. But I did want to put in perspective what this means for a company like Chevron. \nPaul Cheng: Sure, I understand. But I think Jay when you're saying that you're unhappy about the engineering on this. So is it not upon the finger, but is it an internal issue, or just an external the contract that you guys use?\nJay Johnson: You're asking\u2026\nPaul Cheng: How do you -- how are you really going to be able to mitigate it in the future? I mean that -- what -- I mean you say you learned from that, but exactly what have we learned? And what is the change will be? \nJay Johnson: From an engineering standpoint, Paul I think we have a couple of things. One, is we are doing more to bring the early engineering back in-house and do more focused design development with our own capabilities. And we're trying to minimize the amount of variation that we see in terms of each project team's decisions that they make around engineering. I think that's a key part of it. And I think looking at the total project in the context of the environment, it's going to be built. It's also important. I do think there are also opportunities for the industry to improve on engineering. I don't think this is necessarily isolated to our company. So there's work to be done as we really understand how to better define and prosecute the engineering programs that are necessary for these projects.\nPierre Breber: And if I can just -- what Jay said is we don't have projects like this in our Q. If you look at our capital program, a lot of base business capital, shale and tight capital, we are going to have some major capital projects but the ones that are coming up are deepwater projects, and they're very different than these. A lot of the spending is in drilling and completion, where we're very good on the facility side, it tends to be standard designs in fabrication yards. As Jay said, it's not land-based projects in remote locations, and we have a better track record in those ones. So, again, we need to do better. We're learning from it. From an enterprise perspective, the portfolio, the investments that are at least in front of us are hitting a different place than where this project has been.\nPaul Cheng: My final question, Jay and Pierre, I think in Tengiz even before the cost increase, the full project return on capital -- the full cycle internal rate of return is actually pretty low. And with this that, of course, is much lower. But the cash flow will be great once that they come onstream. So which is a more important factor when you guys determine whether you want to go with a certain project? Is it the internal way of return, or is the cash flow and the sustainability of that cash flow, say, for how long. So I'm trying to understand that the decision-making process?\nPierre Breber: Yes. Look I'll start and maybe Jay will add some comments. I mean, you've heard, Jay and Mike and myself, are all talking about increasing returns on capital. So we are focused on the return on investment. And so we are looking at it. And once you have a cost increase, I think it's stating the obvious that, that dilutes the returns, and we're taking a lot of actions to offset that, both at Tengiz and across the rest of the portfolio. I tried to give, again, some financials that kind of characterize what the impact is, again, on a company like Chevron, less than $0.20 per share. But we are looking fundamentally at returns on capital, but we also know cash is important. It helps pay the dividend and support the share buybacks.\nJay Johnson: I would just say this particular project, Paul, I know your views on it have been the same for a long time, but this is an important project for Tengiz, it does lower the back pressure on all the wells and addresses the declining reservoir pressure that we see there. It provides excess gas handling, which will unlock oil production in our existing facilities as well as for FGP and it helps maintain reservoir pressure in the platform, which is an important aspect of the overall performance of Tengiz, not just the incremental performance. There also, as Pierre said, we're looking at ways that this can be offset. And one of the key milestones that was achieved was the decision to debottleneck the CPC pipeline. And so that's going to open up some additional export capacity, which will improve realizations and help boost returns and help mitigate and offset some of the increases that we're seeing on project cost.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you, all.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nDevin McDermott: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nJay Johnson: Good morning, Devin.\nDevin McDermott: I wanted to follow-up on some of the exploration discussion from earlier. You talked a little bit about Brazil, but you also highlighted in the release and slides, some additional blocks in the offshore Gulf of Mexico, and I think you've been fairly active in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico leasing as well. As we're going to step back and look at where you're seeing the most opportunity from here, can you talk a little bit more about that and the overall strategy here and the desire, if any, to diversified growth options away from shale and tight, but I think you mentioned there were some larger capital projects offshore potentially in the pipe? So a little more color on that would be great.\nJay Johnson: Yes. Thanks for the question. So in addition to Deepwater Brazil, we have been very interested in some of the deepwater in the Mexican areas of the Gulf of Mexico. And this plays on a lot of the knowledge we already have in the U.S. sector of the Gulf of Mexico. So we've recently farmed into some additional blocks and these complement nicely some blocks we'd acquired in an earlier bid round. One of our strategies has been to move out of more of the frontier highly-speculative areas and really focus our exploration initiatives in the areas that we consider to be highly-prolific basins and that really increases our probability of success. At the same time, we're doing that, we're trying to balance the amount of capital that what goes in early and really use the fact that some of this is only under 2D seismic or lightly explored to open up new opportunities for development. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we've been very active. And one of the key strategies in the U.S. Gulf is to focus a lot of our new blocks around existing infrastructure and we're looking to push that envelope of how far we can tie back exploration opportunities or discoveries to existing infrastructure and avoid having to build brand-new greenfield. A couple of examples of that would be, for example, you recently heard about the Esox discovery with another operator, that will tie back to Tubular Bells. It's very close. It brings new production in at very low capital cost and with a very short-cycle time. So those are kind of the low-cost high-return subsea tiebacks that are being enabled and supported by our exploration strategy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We're also talking about extending that reach, as I said, through some of the new technology. We have used quite successfully the single phase pit floor pumping at Jack and St. Malo and really proven that technology, and we've now finished the technical certification to move to multi-phase pumping and this can really extend that radius, of which we can pull production back to existing hosts that have ullage. So it's entirely in line with our theme of exploring in prolific basins, but also utilizing existing infrastructure and getting more out of our existing facilities whenever possible.\nDevin McDermott: Got it. Great. And my second is on some of the comments around incremental efficiencies you're realizing across the portfolio, is one of the things you mentioned in response to the Tengiz's cost pressure. And Pierre, I think you mentioned it also as an area where we've seen success across the portfolio in your prepared remarks. So I was hoping to get a bit more specifics on where within the portfolio you're seeing these capital efficiency improvements. And then also, to the extent you are cutting back capital in more gassy areas in response to the Tengiz's pressure? Any additional detail on where that is, in North America, gas elsewhere in the portfolio. Additional color would be helpful there as well.\nJay Johnson: Sure. The increased efficiencies, quite honestly, are happening across the board. All of our units are really focused on how to continue to drive better performance out of the investments we've made in the past. We've seen some great improvements in particular, for example, in Angola, where they have developed some new opportunities by using our existing installed base. We saw a very strong cash flow coming out of Angola, and there's been a lot of good cooperative work with the government of Angola to unlock many of the marginal reserves that can be tied back to our existing facilities. But it really is happening around the world. In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, we've seen our unit development cost come down to where we're now targeting $16 to $20 a barrel for new facilities and projects like Anchor and Whale, certainly we're targeting in that range. The OpEx in the Gulf of Mexico and the deepwater has come down to just under $10 a barrel, which is a significant reduction from where we were in 2014. We're taking these lessons learned, we're sharing them across other areas in the company to make sure that it's one thing to share, it's another to adopt these best practices, but we're seeing great cooperation between our business units and we're going to be really focused on doing that even more as we move forward. All of this isn't just in response to Tengiz. But rather it's the context of Tengiz in this environment that's allowing us to do this and I think do it quite efficiently. In terms of the specifics on where in our capital program we'll be making changes. That's not something that we'll discuss at this point in time, but we'll give more color on that potentially in December with our capital announcement and of course in the SAM, the Security Analyst Meeting that we do early in the year each year.\nDevin McDermott: Understood. Thank you.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC. Your question please.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Sorry, I have another one on Tengiz. Jay, you mentioned the significant productivity improvements in 2018, 2019 but taking that on board that would suggest the CapEx increase was coming quite a long time ago. So I guess just want to square that comment with the CapEx increase today and the timing of that. But taking a step back, you look at the last few years and you've had your fair share of issues at some of these major projects. Pierre, you're signing off on these. I just wonder if these experiences make you think twice about embarking on these types of projects of this scale in the future? That would be my first question. Then I've got another follow-up. Thanks.\nJay Johnson: So on the productivity the contracts at site at Tengiz and the construction are largely unit rates. So we pay based on the quantities that are being installed. But the productivity is important, because it relates to the underlying schedule and the ability to finish the work and execute the work in the time frame that we've got. And with the numbers of people we planned, because there's a lot of indirects that come with having to add additional direct labor. So while the unit rates have been in place, it's really the complexity that has increased on some of the manhours. We've talked in the past about the unit rate costs that were in our bids for the mechanical electrical and instrumentation work. But really the surprise has been the increase in quantities, because when you multiply the quantities times those rates that's what's resulting in the higher cost. And as I said the shift in schedule. So that's how I square that with what we've given you in the past and really what came out of the detailed cost and schedule review that we just completed.\nPierre Breber: Yeah. And Biraj in terms of -- I think I addressed this. I mean, we don't have other projects like STP WPMP in our queue. Kitimat is being worked but it's not ready. What we have is a lot of base business capital, a lot of shale and tight and hopefully some deepwater projects here over time. So I understand your question, it's theoretical. I'm not going to speculate about it. But as I look at our portfolio right now we don't have that choice. That said, we're going to be in the business a long time. We're going to learn from it. We have to do better, but we don't have any immediate capital decisions that are in this large scale land based construction project.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay, understood. Just to follow-up, hopefully, an easier question, but the tax on repatriated cash, are you expecting that to be a one-off, or is it -- should we expect more of these in the future? Can you confirm whether that was cash tax or just a P&L charge? Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Yes. So thanks for that question. So, no, we completed a global cash management review in the third quarter and decided to repatriate this cash, which was previously unremitted. So prior to completing this review, these earnings were expected to be invested outside the U.S., and that's why we didn't accrue for the state and forward withholding taxes. So when we made the decision to repatriate it, that's when we accrue the tax. So it is a cash tax, but the cash -- the tax payment will be in the fourth quarter. We accrued the P&L was in the third quarter. And the actual cash movements, so this will bring non-U.S. cash into the U.S. It will allow us to lower our cash balances, will lower our debt balances. We're doing it because it's the right economic decision. And this is for prior earnings. We do not expect other types of repatriations of prior earnings like this. At the same time, there could be some current earnings that, of course, are repatriated, and that's in the normal course of business. So, no, this is a one-off. It's over $8 billion of non-U.S. cash being brought to the U.S. You won't see our U.S. cash balances go down by that full amount because some of it had been lent into the U.S., but we expect our year-end cash balances to be $3 billion to $4 billion lower than where we ended the third quarter. We ended the third quarter a little bit high because we were preparing for some of these moves to repatriate the cash.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks, everybody. Jay, I know you don't or maybe, Pierre, I know you guys don't normally want to talk about fiscal terms, but in light of the Tengiz's cost increases. I just wondered if you could just remind us or walk us through what the implications are for cost recovery, because I'm guessing that with existing production and like of ring-fencing and so on, the net impact of this may not be as severe as, obviously, the headline cost overrun suggested. I just wonder if you could walk us through what the cost recovery ramifications are please? And I've got a follow-up.\nJay Johnson: Well, this is a tax and royalty contract in Tengiz. And so it's really going to be through the DD&A and the way that flows through the books in terms of the recovery. So it's impacting returns more than it will the actual cash flow once we get past the start-up of the facility.\nDoug Leggate: I was under the impression it was going to accelerate the DD&A, is that not the case?\nJay Johnson: As I said, we're not going to discuss the terms of the contract, but it's a tax and royalty contract and...\nPierre Breber: And just to be clear, when I refer to the less than $0.20, I'm talking about booked DD&A, booked depreciation, not tax depreciation, which obviously is different.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. No, I'm sorry I thought it was an accelerated piece to that. Thanks. My follow-up is really more going back to the Permian. Obviously, the plan you've laid out is continuing to -- you continue to outperform against at least the production profile. But when you laid out the plan, you talked about when you would expect the Permian to be cash breakeven in terms of capital and cash flow and obviously, royalty contribution and so on. Obviously, NGL and gas prices have deteriorated quite materially. So I'm wondering if you could just update your thoughts on that. And specifically, on the takeaway solutions that you've announced over the last several months. What does that do to your ability to improve gas and NGL realizations of those lease line? Or are they going to uplift your realizations with more to work in the Gulf Coast type metric to? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nJay Johnson: Well, we went through a lot of this, Doug, as you know in the second quarter call and that guidance still stands. In terms of the crude takeaway capacity, we have sufficient capacity, not just to produce it into the basin, but to take it to Houston and now we have export capacity opening up as well, 35% now and 40% in 2020. So that's the crude side of things. NGLs are sufficient through 2020. And in terms of gas, our primary focus was to make sure we have evacuation capacity in the basin and we have 100% of that covered. Our view and our practice is that we have no routine flaring of gas to enable production. And we've been able to honor that. In terms of moving gas out of the basin, right now, we have about 25% capacity and it's going to vary based on how these different pipelines come on stream, but by the second quarter of 2021 we're expecting to have about 80% of our gas flowing out of the basin. We are still expecting to have free cash flow positive next year.\nDoug Leggate: Jay, just to be clear, this is \u2013 is the 60%, 65% gas in NGLs? Or can you \u2013 I know you talk about liquids, but can you split the oil versus NGL portion then I'll leave it at that. Thank you.\nJay Johnson: We see -- roughly half of our total mix is in crude, about a-quarter of it is in gas liquids and about a-quarter of it's in natural gas.\nDoug Leggate: Helpful. Thanks a lot.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Doug.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please.\nDan Boyd: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just want to actually follow-up again on the TCO spend. And if I recall correctly last year you spent about $600 million more than you initially budgeted. So what I'm wondering is how much of the sort of overrun is going to be already spent or in the budget by the end of this year? That's sort of the first question. And then, the follow-up is, when I look at your total CapEx budget, in order to be below the $20 billion for next year, given that affiliate spending will still stay high. Are you implying that your cash CapEx could potentially be down next year? And I'm just wondering if there's a potential production impact of that or if the Permian is running ahead of schedule enough to offset any of that.\nJay Johnson: So a couple things, Dan. First of all, I'd take you to slide 10 and that kind of shows our production or our spending profile for the FGP project. And we see 2018 and 2019 as our peak years of spend. And as we look to 2020, we'll start spending at a lower rate as we move and consolidate really the activities largely into site construction work. We have one more year of fabrication to go in one of the four original yards. And that work is currently about 73% complete. In terms of how to allocate the incremental spend over the total project, I would say, roughly it's about half of it behind us, half of it -- about $4 billion to $5 billion in front of us. But as we look at it, it's really in that increased construction costs where we see the majority of the increase and the surprise. The part that we did in the first engineer -- or the engineering and fabrication was more directed around the consumption of contingency. The increases we've really seen have been in construction and schedule.\nPierre Breber: So Dan again just to build off Jay's comments. I mean, we're coming off of reaffirmed the guidance for next year between $18 billion to $20 billion. TCO will be coming off as Jay said. And so we have -- we're doing -- we're finalizing our plan and our capital program right now. But we have -- between the efficiencies that Jay talked about and choices we can make around deferring low return projects, we absolutely have the capability of landing a capital program in that range. \nDan Boyd: Okay. And the production outlook more than offset that in other areas?\nPierre Breber: Yeah, I mean we haven't given production guidance year-by-year. We've given the 3% to 4% production outlook to 2023, so no change to that. Again some of the examples, some of the offsets do not impact production. Clearly if we defer some lower return natural gas investments or we decide to flex down some of our shorter cycle spend that could have a modest impact on production, but there are other things that are going better like the Permian and other offsets that we're trying to manage. So we will give our \u2013 usual one-year outlook on production guidance on the fourth quarter call in late January.\nDan Boyd: Okay. Thanks, Jay.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nRoger Read: Good morning. Thank you. I guess, maybe it's been mentioned a couple of different times, the weakness in gas, maybe as you think about global gas markets, LNG, what you're seeing in terms of any additional risk we should think about on the spot market side or on the contracted side for LNG? And then there's a little add-on to that, just an update of how Gorgon and Wheatstone are performing here in planned and unplanned maintenance? \nJay Johnson: Okay. Gorgon and Wheatstone are actually performing quite well. Gorgon Train 1 is currently under a scheduled turnaround or planned turnaround. But as you saw our third quarter production and there's a slide in the back was very strong out of both Gorgon and Wheatstone and we continue to stay focused on enhancing the reliability and the utilization of those facilities as well as creeping the capacity. We have a turnaround schedule that is going to be planned for both of those and it'll be an annual event. Those will be -- we'll talk about those as we get closer to them. We have another train for Gorgon next year that has been announced. And these will be done to allow us to get into a regular rotation of turnaround, so they can be done safely and efficiently just as we do in our downstream facilities and places like Tengiz. We do see the potential for spot to be higher as we increase production, as we hit stronger production, we will have more cargoes available for spot. That's a good thing, because we actually have more production than we'd planned for. But over time as the reliability continues to strengthen, we would expect to try and term up some of that anticipated spot cargoes and reduce the amount of spot in any given quarter relative to either long-term or medium-term contracts that we've put in place.\nPierre Breber: Yeah. The only thing to add and Jay mentioned this in the second quarter, we have seen some customers downward flex on the long-term contracts. This is something that is within contractual limits and within the contractual terms. They have to do it almost a year ahead. It's tied to Annual delivery schedule, but we have seen some of that, and that has resulted in a little bit more in the spot market than we otherwise would have.\nRoger Read: And any particular weakness in the spot markets that you're seeing at this point, or are we pretty well past that for the summer time?\nPierre Breber: In terms of calling -- and look, it looks -- the macro on spot LNG looks sort of structurally oversupplied. Of course, a cold winter can certainly fix a fair amount of that, but storage levels in Europe, our full Asia seems to be well positioned. So if I look at it right now, again, it looks oversupply and there's more LNG coming on. But markets surprised us all the time. I mean, the takeaway for us is we are just not really exposed to the spot market. We are primarily selling under oil-linked, long-term contracts. Thanks, Roger.\nRoger Read: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\nSam Margolin: Hello.\nPierre Breber: Hey, Sam.\nSam Margolin: So my first question is on the Permian, and it's probably for Jay. I think it's well-understood that your leading-edge wells perform better and better. I'm interested as the base gets bigger and is more important to the overall production targets, how your first-generation wells look if your EURs, that you projected, look like they're intact or growing or changing in any way? And if there's sort of rigless activity work workover stuff that you have to do that you had modeled or maybe it's less than what you modeled, but just any update on kind of your older wells and how that component of the Permian is shaping up today would be great.\nJay Johnson: That's a good question, Sam. Thank you. When we look at our production performance out of our wells, the early horizontal wells have actually performed as we expected them to perform. And so our EURs have been consistent with expectation for the wells as we move through. As we have continued to evolve, though, our basis of design and our completion strategies, we've seen higher and higher EURs and the new wells, of course, are meeting those expectations as well. So overall, the program is working as planned. The newer wells, as you point out, are much more productive than some of the older wells, but they're all meeting the expectations that we've set for them at the time in the aggregate. Obviously, any individual well may be higher or lower than planned. But as a portfolio, as a program, we've been overall pleased with the performance. And that's really what's underpinning our ability to deliver the production profile you can see on the chart in the appendix.\nSam Margolin: Okay, thanks so much. And then just a follow-up, Pierre, you get this question all the time about the leverage profile on the balance sheet, but the net debt continues to fall. The ratio of your free cash flow annualized and not a great year to net debt is like 1.5 times. Is there a level of net debt that you think is under-levered or suboptimal for the business, especially in the context of Tengiz? If the biggest impact is a return impairment, you can enhance that to the equity with some leverage deployed somehow, so just your thoughts on how net debt's trending and what optimal leverage is?\nPierre Breber: Yes. No, thanks, Sam. Look, yes, we are generating good cash in a challenging macro environment. I think you know our four financial priorities. I will go them quickly. The first is to sustain and grow the dividend and we increased it 6% later this year. The second is the reinvest capital in the business and you heard Jay reaffirm our capital guidance. So we are not going to add to our capital program. The third is to maintain a strong balance sheet and that's what you're asking, I'll get to that. And the fourth is our buyback program that we intend to sustain through the cycle and we have that at a $5 billion annual rate. So what happens in the short term, clearly, if we generate more cash than those three requirements: in particular the dividend, which we increased earlier this year; the capital program, which we're holding flat and the buyback program. Then it goes to the balance sheet. That's where it's going to go in the short term, that's just that's just how the math works, but over time, we expect if those conditions continue without speculating about future dividend increases or share buybacks, over time that cash should be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividends, and a sustained buyback program, because as you say, we don't need to be an even stronger credit. We have the leading balance sheet in the industry. We have the strongest balance sheet in the industry. And I've talked about a gross debt to capital ratio of 20% to 25%, we're well below that, I'm comfortable being below that, because that's again the outcome of our cash generation profile, depending on where the macro environment. Obviously, that can change, but we are very well positioned to grow dividends sustain the buyback invest in the business and maintain a strong balance sheet.\nSam Margolin: Thanks so much.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Sam.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Your question, please.\nJason Gabelman: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to firstly quickly confirm that 2019 CapEx hasn't changed as a result of the TCO overspend. And then, secondly, just wanted to get your thoughts on M&A. That hasn't been addressed this call. I think in the past, you've discussed wanting to kind of expand or potentially acquire some company that operates in multiple arenas, not just one that operates in U.S. shale. I'm wondering, if that's still the way you're thinking about M&A and how the opportunity set looks right now. Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. On your first question on capital for this year, our capital budget on an organic basis is $20 billion. Year-to-date, we're at $14.5 billion, so we're basically on track. We've had some modest in organic capital year-to-date, that's been the Pasadena refinery primarily, and we guided to a little bit for the Brazil exploration bit around. So, again, we're on track for delivering an organic capital program in line with our budget of $20 billion. In terms of M&A, I'm not going to speculate on that. I think you've heard us talk about it. Look, we have a very strong value proposition. We have a 4% dividend yield, a 2% share buyback or the buyback equivalent to 2% of the shares, a free cash flow yield a 7%, an advantage portfolio that Jay has been talking about, with strong resources and reserves that allow us to grow cash flow and grow production over time. So we don't need to do a deal. All that said, at times in the past we have been opportunistic when we think it's in the interest of our shareholders, it is difficult to make M&A work for our shareholders. And right now, we think we have a very good value proposition on our own for our shareholders. Thanks, Jason appreciate the question.\nJason Gabelman: Thanks.\nWayne Borduin: Okay. Jonathan.\nOperator: Yes. And I\u2019d like to hand it back to you for any further remarks.\nWayne Borduin: Well, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready \u2013 now, that's the end of the call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-08-02 14:09:06", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead.\nWayne Borduin: Thank you Jonathan, and welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement and important information for investors and stockholders on slide 2. Turning to slide 3. And Pierre? \nPierre Breber: Thanks, Wayne. We had another solid quarter. The company delivered record production, led by continued strength in the Permian Basin and at Wheatstone in Australia. Jay will provide more detail shortly. First, an overview of our financial results. Earnings were $4.3 billion or $2.27 per share. This is the highest reported quarterly result since the third quarter 2014 when Brent was over $100 a barrel. The quarter's results include special lighting gains, totaling $920 million from the Anadarko termination fee and a tax rate change in Alberta. Foreign exchange gains for the quarter were $15 million. Excluding special items and FX gains earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.77 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations was almost $8 billion excluding working capital changes. We also maintained a strong balance sheet with a low debt ratio. Importantly our continued strong cash flow allowed us to deliver on our commitment to return significant cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we paid over $2 billion in dividends. And after terminating our agreement with Anadarko, we resumed buybacks and repurchased $1 billion of shares during the quarter. Going forward we expect share buybacks at the $5 billion annual run rate or $1.25 billion per quarter, in line with our updated guidance stated in May. We also continued to maintain capital discipline with a focus on increasing returns. Year-to-date organic CapEx was $9.6 billion, a little less than half of our $20 billion budget. Total CapEx, which includes acquisition costs that are unbudgeted such as the purchase of the Pasadena refinery, totaled $10 billion. Turning to slide 4. Cash flow was strong and the trend is in line with full year guidance. Cash flow from operations excluding working capital increased this quarter due to growing production volumes and higher liquids realizations as well as the termination fee received from Anadarko.\nJay Johnson: Thanks Pierre. On Slide 7, second quarter oil equivalent production increased 9% compared to a year ago with shale and tight production increasing in the Delaware and Midland Basin and production from major capital projects increasing with ramp-ups at Wheatstone, Hebron, and Big Foot. Our base business production increased as Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater brownfield developments more than offset natural declines across the portfolio. Turning to Slide 8, second quarter production was strong at more than 3 million barrels a day for the third straight quarter. Year-to-date production excluding asset sales is about 5% higher than 2018 consistent with our guidance of 4% to 7% growth as shown by the middle bar. Second quarter production was impacted by planned turnarounds and asset sales which together had an impact of almost 70,000 barrels a day. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect production growth to be primarily driven by our shale and tight assets as well as the continued ramp-up of Big Foot and Hebron. This growth will be partially offset by higher turnaround activity in the third quarter. Our full year outlook is expected to be in line with this guidance even before adjusting for the entitlement impacts of higher prices.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Jay. Slide 14 highlights some recent commercial developments. First, through our joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, we announced two new petrochemical investments, one in the U.S. Gulf Coast and one in Qatar. Each is in the joint venture with Qatar Petroleum. The long-term fundamentals of chemicals are strong. We believe these projects offer attractive returns underpinned by advantaged feedstocks, world-class scale and leading technology. Also in the quarter, we closed the sale of our interest in Denmark and executed an agreement to sell our U.K. Central, North Sea fields which we expect to close later this year. Additionally, we completed our acquisition of the Pasadena refinery which will enable us to supply more of our retail market in the region and process more domestic light oil. In the renewable space, we recently agreed to purchase wind power to supply our Permian operations. This is a cost-effective renewable energy alternative to our current electricity supply in the Permian. Also Chevron executed an agreement to be an equity partner in CalBioGas, a joint venture to produce end market, dairy biomethane as a vehicle fuel in California. The project will capture methane that otherwise would be vented into the atmosphere and process it into renewable natural gas. Turning to slide 15. Our performance this quarter reinforces four key messages you've heard from us in the past. First, we have an advantaged portfolio that is delivering today and is positioned to do so over the long-term as Jay highlighted in the Permian Gulf of Mexico and at Tengiz.\nWayne Borduin: We\u2019re here. Thanks, Jonathan.\nOperator: Thank you. Would you like to take questions at this time?\nWayne Borduin: I believe we were cut off prematurely, so actually we'll begin with slide 16. \nOperator: All right. You may resume.\nPierre Breber: Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. This is Pierre and we understand that we cut off at slide 16, so I'm going to resume there and we're going to look ahead. In Upstream, we continue to expect 2019 production growth to be 4% to 7%, excluding 2019 asset sales. Planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and Nigeria and the North West Shelf and Australia as well as the early July hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to impact production in the third quarter. Our full year guidance for TCO co-lending is unchanged at $2 billion depending upon price, investment profile, and its dividends. In downstream, we expect high level of refinery turnaround activity in the third quarter which guides to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of more than $200 million. For the third quarter, we expect a repurchase -- we expect to repurchase shares at a rate of $1.2 billion per quarter. With that I'll hand the call back over to Wayne.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.\nPhil Gresh: Yes, hi good morning. Can you hear me all right?\nWayne Borduin: Good morning Phil.\nPhil Gresh: Yes. So, I guess first question just looking at this Permian additional disclosure and your cash flow expectations, it seems like what you're implying here is that you can grow earnings and cash flow and the ratio of cash flow to CapEx keeps going up. So, it seems to imply pretty flattish CapEx profile, which I think is fairly consistent with the rig count trajectory you talked about at Analyst Day. So, I was wondering if you could maybe just kind of walk through that detail. And then secondarily with -- related to that I know you recently had an announcement that you made with enterprise talking about takeaway out of the Permian. I was just wondering how that all feeds into this ability to ensure you get the best realizations for your production. Thanks.\nJay Johnson: Okay. I'll take it and Pierre may want to add some at the end. From a CapEx standpoint, Phil, we are looking to maintain a relatively flat profile in capital and that's because essentially we're looking to have a very steady rig fleet as we go forward. We have 20 company-operated rigs. Those are basically on a 100% basis because we operate our own licenses. And then we look for about 30 roughly gross non-operated rigs which equates to about seven to 10 net non-operated rigs. So, as we move that forward, we expect to see capital relatively constant. We're building out infrastructure of course and we always have some exploration activity out in front of us and we also do pilot work to ensure that we are continuing to drive to increase the recovery and efficiency of our developments. In terms of the takeaway capacity, I'll break it into three different streams. I'll start with the crude oil and basically for 2019, we're well covered on our takeaway capacity for crude oil. In 2020, we are also covered for the year. There may be periods of tightness in length as we move through the year, but we recently executed an agreement with enterprise not only for takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin, but also for export capacity that will lengthen our ability to supply crude not only in the domestic U.S., but internationally. When we look at natural gas liquids, we have full takeaway capacity for this year and next year. And as we turn to gas, we really think of gas in two ways. The first is just basic flow assurance. We need to be able to move the gas without having to flare or have any threat of mitigating production in our avoidance of flaring. So we have 100% flow assurance set up for the balance of this year and next year. In terms of takeaway of gas from the basin outward for export, what we look at is this year we're at about 20% of our gas can be exported from the basin. And by the end of this year, we expect to be about 25%. By the end of next year we should be more like 60% of our gas being exported from the basin gives us more exposure to other price structures rather than just the Waha.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Phil.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Just my follow-up question then for Pierre would just be some of your balance sheet commentary. Your net debt-to-cap, I believe is a low sicne it\u2019s been since mid-2015. I know you increased the buyback a bit. There's the situation where you had an M&A considerations there that you walked away from, but I guess how do you think about that level of financial leverage? And where you want to keep that balance sheet for opportunities that might present themselves? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Yeah. Well, thanks Phil. Look our cash generation has been strong and we've been returning cash to shareholders and we increased our dividend 6% early this year. As you mentioned we raised our guidance on the share buyback rate in May to $5 billion per year. We're being very disciplined with capital, managing to our $20 billion organic budget in 2019. So the way the math works, no doubt in the short-term, our strong balance sheet gets even stronger. That's okay. Over time this strong cash generation will be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividends and a sustained share buyback program. That's the way I would think about it. I won't comment on M&A. We, obviously, have -- we're in a very financially strong position, same time we got a great value proposition for our shareholders that we've communicated at our March Analyst Day and then Jay provided more insight into some key elements today and that's what we're focused on delivering.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Phil.\nPhil Gresh: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning team. I guess, the first question I have Jay, you just came back from Kazakhstan sounds like. There's \u2013 there was some questions around labor productivity as it relates to Tengiz. Can you just confirm everything is on track and then just in terms of the capital budget as well your confidence level in achieving the targets that you set out?\nJay Johnson: Yes. We just did come back in June and we talked about this at the Security Analyst Meeting and in previous calls. A big focus at site now is on labor productivity. We've got a lot of work to do as the modules come in or set on foundations. Last year we're primarily focused on civils and undergrounds. This year we're making the transition to mechanical, electrical and instrumentation. As we look forward we have to get through commissioning and then all the start-up activities. So we've put in place specific tools that can really help us, not only drive the productivity but understand what the drivers are, where we have gaps, from where expectations are and what we need to do to close those. Those tools are now widespread across the site and are proving to be very effective, so we've seen steadily improving productivity across the workforce and are actually feeling pretty good about where the execution is headed at this point. But it's early days. We're 40%, roughly complete on construction and we've got a lot of man-hours to go over the next couple of years. In terms of the overall capital program, you've seen we continue to be right in the middle, right on our guidance. We're about 50% expanded on our Chevron C&E through mid-year and we still expect to maintain our guidance of $18 billion to $20 billion for next year, so that should give you a pretty good idea of where things sit.\nNeil Mehta: Appreciate this. And just a follow-up question, this might be for you Pierre. You've gotten a lot of credit from investors for stepping away from the Anadarko potential transaction and showing the capital discipline. Since the deal closed, the stock has materially outperformed other constituents of the XLE or XOP and others, independent E&Ps and that multiple arbitrage or share price ratio arbitrage seems to be opening up again. Just want to get your thoughts on M&A. Again, it felt opportunistic, but is another opportunity potentially opening up here?\nPierre Breber: Yeah. No. Thanks Neil. Look, I honestly can't speculate on M&A. What I can restate is we have a very strong value proposition for our shareholders. And if I can just -- some of the key elements that we communicated in March is 3% to 4% production growth guidance through 2023, a very disciplined capital program. Jay provided the 2020 guidance of $18 billion to $20 billion and longer-term guidance of $19 billion to $22 billion from 2021 to 2023. We have leading upstream cash flow margins, leading earnings margins and we're improving cash return on capital employed by more than 3%. So, we clearly do not need to do a deal. That said, as you said, we have been opportunistic in the past if we see a good strategic fit at a good price, at a good value. And two recent examples would be the Pasadena refinery and Anadarko. But we've moved on and we're focused on delivering growing earnings and cash flows for our shareholder.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question, please.\nAlastair Syme: Good afternoon. I just had a couple of questions. One, can you talk a little bit about Anchor, which you're hoping to do FID next year? What do you think has to happen to move that forward? Because my understanding is, there are still some quite significant technological challenges. And the follow-up, if you can just talk a little bit, it's just sort of a question, just on the asset sales, that you announced the U.K. asset sales in the quarter. Can you talk about what happens on the decommissioning of liabilities associated with those assets, please? \nJay Johnson: Yeah. So with Anchor, we are in the FEED process, so this is doing all the preliminary engineering work prior to the detailed engineering. I would say there are two primary technologies to be developed to support Anchor. And in developing for Anchor, we'll also have these available for other opportunities that we foresee. The first is just the high-pressured technology, getting to that 20,000-psi. That's well along and we really -- it really comes down to just thicker seal. We're in the qualification stages and we really don't see that as a major technology shift. It's just a matter of working through the process. And the second is the higher hook loads for deeper wells and this will also support potential developments like Ballymore. So neither of those do we regard as a particularly challenging technological advance, but an important one to get finished. So we do expect to be on path with Anchor for FID early in the next year. In terms of the North Sea deal, we really don't get into the details of any of our commercial transactions. I can't really comment too much on that, other than to say, as an overall package we're very comfortable with the transaction as its been constructed and are working with the buyer to move it forward to close. \nPierre Breber: Yes. And I think I can add to Jay's comments that, we're fully in-tune with the importance of embedded obligations and that's carefully considered in terms of the financial strength of the partners or the parties that we transact with. And again we won't be specific as it's commercially sensitive, but its -- as you can imagine the point of negotiation and something that we don't intend to be exposed to over time. \nAlastair Syme: Thanks very much.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Alastair.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And apologies, if I miss this on the call but, I have a question on LNG. You mentioned a higher ratio of spot LNG sales in the quarter. Could you just talk through what was driving that? One of your payers has talked about buyers for their contracts not taking their full nominations. I was wondering if that was the issue or there's something else there. Thank you.\nJames Johnson: Yes, thanks Biraj. I'll talk first in general because there's an element of -- as we gain in our performance, the facilities are performing very well, reliability is coming up, we have extra production over and above what we had planned and so all that production is going to be exposed to spot prices. And so that's going to be an ongoing thing. In the second quarter specifically, we certainly had excellent performance at both Gorgon and Wheatstone. And so we had extra production coming from that. But at the same time we also deferred a turnaround, so we had a turnaround scheduled in the second quarter that's been moved to the fourth. So we had extra cargoes there that were exposed to spot. We do have some downward flex that was exercised by our purchasers in the shoulder months and that occurred in the second quarter. And then finally, there's also an element even in our fixed-term contracts where we had about a 3 to 6 month delay in the oil pricing that they're linked to and so we saw some downward movement in that element. So together those all really drive the realizations in the second quarter for our LNG. But as I say going forward, we do expect to see increased production as our reliabilities been higher and our overall goal would be to term that up and get closer to what our expected production is as we gain continued confidence in the reliability of the facilities. \nBiraj Borkhataria: That's great color. And just a quick follow-up. At Gorgon in particular I think in the past you talked about debottlenecking the project to increased capacity buy maybe 10% or 15%. Could you just update us on where we are now and relative to the original nameplate? \nJames Johnson: Yes I don't recall us giving out specific guidance on percentages of increase. Our focus right now is doing a couple of things. First is just getting the reliability increasingly high and we've seen very good reliability. We're still learning these facilities as we continue to operate and we built learnings from some of the shutdowns and turnarounds that we've already accomplished in the future ones. As we look forward, what we are looking at is we're collecting the data literally daily as we move through an annual cycle of the ambient conditions as well as the performance of the plan. We look for where the restructuring to keep us from going to the next level of production. At this point in time, I'd say we're probably 2% above where we expect it to be on Gorgon production, around 6% above on Wheatstone. But it's an ongoing effort as we move forward to get more out of our existing investments and infrastructure.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Biraj.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby from UBS. Your question please.\nJon Rigby: Okay, thank you. Yeah. The first is the Anadarko transaction during that process, I felt that you indicated that you had capacity and the willingness to deepen your deepwater participation globally and you spoke quite enthusiastically about adding extra LNG to your portfolio, creating a global position et cetera. So as you move forward with new opportunities and when they arise, is -- thematically outside of the U. S. is that where we should expect you to be appearing or looking? And then the second, just very specifically, with the new refinery asset, what are the plans for that now you've got ownership of it? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Yeah. Thanks Jon. This is Pierre and I'll start. I said earlier we moved on, but look we\u2019ll go back to Anadarko a little bit here. Look there are several elements of it, the transaction there was the FID in the Permian, there was the FID in the Gulf of Mexico and there was the LNG. And there was the ability to get synergies out of the transaction and do it at an attractive price that we thought was good for their shareholders and good for our shareholders. So that -- if you want to get into our thinking we\u2019re -- adding LNG is something that absolutely we are interested in doing. We've got a great position in Australia that Jay just talked about that's generating a lot of cash where we have opportunities to debottleneck and potentially add to that over time. And you'd expect that we are -- we're always working the portfolio and LNG is one of the asset classes that we're interested in and we'll pursue opportunities in that space. That makes sense for the company and our shareholders. In terms of Pasadena, we've had three very clear strategic objectives on it. One was to provide some equity product into our retail network in Texas. The second was to coordinate and optimize feedstocks and other flows between Texas and our refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi. And the third was to process more domestic light oil and increasingly try to position and retool the refinery a little bit to take more and more Permian oil. So really, I mean there -- it's very early days, but I'd say everything is on track and aligned with the strategic rationale. So there's been no surprise in terms of those three objectives. We feel we can meet them with the acquisition. We've had some early wins. In fact over the next few months we expect to run up to 30,000 barrels a day of Permian crude oil. That's a little more than we actually had thought at this point in time. Also we know there's work to do as expected on maintenance and reliability of the facility. So everything is on track and we feel good about it but it's early days. Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.\nJason Gammel: Thanks very much. Hello guys. I had a couple on the Permian, slide number 10. I guess the first one would be, obviously, some fairly impressive absolute performance in increasing EUR and decreasing development production cost on an absolute basis. I know you do a lot of benchmarking. How would you say stack up against industry in those areas now? \nJames Johnson: Yes it's a good question, Jason. I think the -- we do, do a lot of benchmarking and this continues to be an evolving story. So I would say, we're competitive on these areas. We have a very good understanding particularly in terms of the type curves across the entire basin. We have the capability and actually run decline curves across not only our own, but competitors as well so that we understand how our wells are performing and we're actually very comfortable with the overall performance not only in terms of the recoveries, but the economics that we're generating from the execution work. And then when that's coupled up with our ability to use our midstream capability and our royalty position, it's really giving us, I would say leading financial performance overall. So if you went back and look at our Security Analyst Meeting slides, we showed you some of the competitor data. We also showed you, how our actual type curves are performing relative to our expectations and they're very tightly coupled. So I think we have a good understanding, but we're seeing that continued improvement as we move forward.\nPierre Breber: Yes. The only thing I would add to Jay's comments, this is Pierre. You can cherry pick a lot of data out there to position how you look. We've been pretty consistent with what we've shown. And also we've done a lot, not just general benchmarking, but comparisons to our non-op partners or the operators on our behalf, where we know we have very good apples-to-apples data. So it is an area of focus and we feel we compete very well. \nJason Gammel: That's great. And maybe just \u2013 yeah, just a quick follow-up. I noticed the average lateral length that's planned for 2020 is starting to approach 10,000 feet. In the past you've had fairly frequently slides about swapping another positioning to kind of block up your acreage. And if you're moving towards 10,000 feet, I'm suspecting you're getting a long ways towards doing that, but can you just kind of talk about whether there's further opportunity there?\nJames Johnson: Well as we continue -- in the existing development areas we're getting higher and higher on our average lateral length and approaching that 10,000 foot mark. In the areas that we've transacted, we had about 60,000 acres that we transacted in 2017 and 95,000 acres in 2018. Those enabled -- about 1,900 longer laterals. So it's really helped us in our core-up development areas. As we continue though to open up new development areas, we're going to continue to have this land activity as we optimize our land positions. So about half of our acreage overall, we consider to be a very highly productive areas and what we want to do is continue to use swap out or swaps and farm-out, sales, acquisitions to continue to core up our development areas. We try and do that in a timely manner. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we do want to make sure that we're drilling efficiently as we start each area. As we said many times, our focus is on delivering returns not just chasing production or chasing a certain activity level.\nJason Gammel: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes in the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks, good morning everyone. I was wondering if Jay, I could take advantage, you been on the call just a little bit in terms of the assumptions you made in the Permian on the cash margins, things have obviously deteriorated at no fall of your, you do in terms of NGLs and gas. So if -- how do you see the prognosis there? What assumptions were you making when you were talking about CapEx versus cash flow? And I guess kind of the last piece of that question is 900,000 barrels a day at a 3.3, 3.4 in 2023 suggests that your cash margin across the portfolio could move away from this sort of sector within level you've had in the past. I'm just curious if you can offer any thoughts on that. I've got a follow-up please. \nJay Johnson: Well, the cash -- the assumptions that we provided that are all given in our Security Analyst Meeting deck, so you can go back and reference those. And what we\u2019re trying to do is, continue to make sure we have the flow assurance as I mentioned earlier on the call, to move gas out to other markets and not have it captured in the immediate basin. Crude oil, we're already well ahead of that. We move our crude outside the basin and we can access and optimize the markets that we're reaching. In terms of the cash margin overall, again we've given you that information. We see that is very strong. There's always going to be fluctuations in the markets as there's tightness and length in different locations. But overall, we feel pretty strong about where we\u2019re heading with this as a production base but also the other production we have around the world.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. I understand, it's -- there's a lot of moving parts in that. My follow-up is kind of related and it's historically when oil prices got a lot weaker, you guys talked routinely about what your sustaining capital was in the portfolio. And obviously, that has been reset favorably by the very large LNG projects and those kind of dominate the base -- the base decline and like thereof. As you move towards, again, this level of funding a significantly larger proportion of your production and a high decline underlying unconventional asset base, what does that do to the sustaining capital versus, I think, you used to talk about like a $13 billion number, how does that evolve as we move towards the five-year plan.\nPierre Breber: Doug, yeah. This is Pierre and I'll start and ask Jay to add some comments. We've never really talked about sustaining capital. We've given -- we have a $20 billion capital budget this year that we talked about $18 billion to $20 billion dollars guidance next year. And then $19 billion to $22 billion, 2021 to 2023. So the guidance is pretty clear, it's pretty tight. That results in enterprise that's growing 3% to 4% of production growth through 2023 with leading cash margin. So the prior eight times, we've talked about the base decline, we are investing in the unconventional, as you saw, in the Permian that it's -- the production is more than doubling, while it's being free cash flow every year, starting next year, at returns that are going from 20% to 30%. So we feel really good about our position. We're not focused on keeping a base flat capital. We're focused on increasing returns. It's resulting in an outcome of higher production. That's translating to higher earnings and cash flow. But the high decline that you referred to is, it's a nature of the business. But when we're investing in it, you can see that, we're more than offsetting that decline and we're doing it in a very economic manner. And as we continue to fill out facilities and keep facilities filled over time, the reinvestment is a very attractive use of capital for the shareholders.\nJay Johnson: I might just build on what Pierre said, because he's absolute right. As we have a larger percentage of our overall production constrained by facilities, that means we have the ability to be very stable on our production. And the same in some respects actually applies in the Permian, while any individual well may have a relatively high decline rate, it does approach an asymptotic curve. But the facilities we install for each of the development areas, our goal is to keep those full. And one of the advantages of the Permian is that, in the initial drilling we fill the facilities up, but then we can go back through infill drilling programs and by going after the subsequent benches in a given development area, and just continue to keep those facilities full, and the amount of rig activity it takes is much less for those subsequent drilling campaigns to maintain that production in a given development area. So I actually feel pretty good about where the whole portfolio has moved and really I'm not too worried about what some people see as a problem with these individual Permian wells.\nDoug Leggate: It\u2019s a great answer guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Doug\u2026\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nRoger Read: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.\nWayne Borduin: Morning Roger.\nRoger Read: Let me just dive in here. Kind of following-up on some of the Permian questions, with your royalty position and others developments and with some of the problems we're seeing from some of those E&Ps, any risk to your outlook from those who might have overstepped their bounds in terms of the way they were developing the Permian?\nPierre Breber: Well, Roger this is Pierre. I mean, you're right. I mean we don't control the royalty barrels because that's being operated by others who own the working interests we're landowner and as Jay said, we receive those barrels with no capital, no operating costs. But the flipside is that if we don't control the development, so we're doing it based on an outlook and an expectation, it certainly we know what the actual had been. But you're right that there is some risk of that. It could go either way. It could go bigger or lower than what we're showing dependent on what those operator's activity levels are.\nRoger Read: Okay, great. And then from a guidance standpoint on the downstream, the hiring refinery turnaround activity, and for the third quarter I was under the impression you'd had fairly high turnaround activity earlier in the first half of this year. So I was just curious was that the right interpretation, and maybe if there's any geographic specific exposure on the high TARs at this quarter.\nPierre Breber: Yeah Roger, so we have now adopted a practice of giving a pretty clear guidance on planned turnaround activity in the downstream and we characterize it as either a low, medium or high. So you're right. Second quarter was high. And that's related to $200 million of after tax, earnings impacts both from higher cost and from lost profit opportunity if the volume is not produced. First quarter was actually low, which is up to $100 million of effects. So in the third quarter with another high quarter that's not unusual, it just depends on how the planned turnarounds are set up. We won't provide specifics on the locations. It's commercially sensitive. And so it's just something that we won't do ahead of time, we're happy to talk about it. Looking backs on the second quarter, we had some planned turnaround activity in Pascagoula and in Asia. So we can explain afterwards, but we think we're giving pretty clear guidance. So you're right that you should view the earnings -- after tax earnings impact of planned turnarounds in 3Q to be the same or similar to 2Q.\nRoger Read: Pierre, I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks Roger.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Howard Weil. Your question please.\nPaul Cheng: Hi good morning. Jay, since you are here and I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the incident in Tengiz with your contractor at least in the media, it seems to me that there's never been more serious talking about -- a between the foreign contractor and the local people and may even be different agenda. Can you give us little bit more update on that and what -- does any initiative had been taken trying to resolve the problem there?\nJay Johnson: Yes, Paul, I can give you a little bit more. We -- this is really centered around one particular contractor that was at the 3GP site and there was obviously some disagreements between some of their workers and the management of that company. When the issue happened, we shut down the entire site -- the 3GP site, not the other site that didn't have any impact on production operation, but we wanted to make sure that the problem was mitigated and contained and we understood what was at the root of it. We worked with that contractor. They're putting in place corrective actions to make sure that they deal with some of the concerns that were there. That is the only contractor that's had an extended ramp-up, so they're working back to their normal strength and we expect to see them that normal strength by the end of August. So, at this point in time, we don't see it as having a material impact on the overall progress of the work. That contractor was about one month ahead of where we expected them to be on their workflow. So, unfortunately we've used up some of that float that have built up, but we believe we're going to be able to mitigate the impact to us. The worker and the workforce relations are always important to us and this is one that we continue to stay focused on. It's very important as now our focus continues to shift to site and I assure you we'll stay focused with our workforce to make sure that we're trying to anticipate and deal with any other concerns.\nPaul Cheng: And the second question Jay. I think in Angola Block 14, I think that the expiration is 2023. And in Nigeria the Agbami I think is 2024. When you guys will start the process for renegotiation on those?\nJay Johnson: Well, that's not something we normally are going to talk much about publicly, Paul. That's between us and our partners and the government. So, I can tell you that those discussions and the planning for that is well in hand, but I really won't be able to go into much detail on those at this time.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Understand. Thank you.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nSam Margolin: Good morning. Hi.\nWayne Borduin: Hey Sam.\nSam Margolin: So, in the Permian one of the things that you talked about contributing to your rig count staying relatively flat is that you're building up a nice stack of vintage wells and you've got some legacy production that's supporting the performance of new wells. Just really quickly Jay can you shed some light on the performance of those older wells? It sounds like you're leading edge wells are meeting your expectations, but how are the vintage wells doing as far as how are they holding up and as they get a little long in the tooth?\nJay Johnson: Actually they're doing quite well. Our focus from day one has been to maximize the returns that we can get from our investments in the Permian. So, there has been a lot of questions why don't we increase our rig fleet, why don't we be more aggressive? But the reality is to continue to learn as everyone in the industry as we move forward and I think a lot of the moves we've made to stay focused on returns now are paying off. Many people talk about how high their initial production rates are in the first six months rates, but what we're really looking at that can actually damage wells and cause aggregated decline curves. So, we're looking at the total expected recovery. We're looking at the economics of the well over its life. We're very careful in our drawdown rates in those early months to make sure that we don't cause damage in the wellbore or in the formation. When we put all that together, we're seeing our base production. That is the production that's already online continuing to perform such that, when we drill these new wells, we can add that on top. And as you saw from the chart, I believe it was on probably page nine, we've been able to continue to deliver right on our production profile and we feel very good about how our wells are performing.\nSam Margolin: Thank you so much. And then - this one should be relatively quick and just in reference to the strategic partnership between CPChem and Qatar, Qatar's got a portfolio of other things that Chevron is probably a good candidate to participate in. Do you see that relationship deepening as you kind of advance on the chemical side throughout the Chevron organization? Or do you see that siloed into Chems?\nJames Johnson: No. No. Look, we have a good relationship with Qatar Petroleum for sure and so do CPChem. And when the Qataris look at CPChem they look at it as three companies, right; Chevron Phillips, Phillips 66 and ourselves. And so, we have a good relationship with them. I will say that the trend \u2013 the deals stand on their own, I mean, the project in Qatar was bid out at U.S. Gulf Coast again there's other alternatives that are considered. So each transaction stands on its own. But we're very proud that we have this platform within and whether that leads to other opportunities or not I won\u2019t speculate, but we certainly have a good base to work-off of.\nSam Margolin: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. You alluded to the gas takeaway issues in the Permian and that you're trying to avoid flaring as much as possible. But of course your realized gas price was $0.60 in Q2. So I'm curious if it might get to a point where you have no practical choice, but to either flare gas or shut in wells. And if that happens which would you choose?\nJames Johnson: We don't flare. We are not flaring and we haven't flared. Our policy is that, we find flow assurance as I said is our first priority so that we can move the gas and we've been doing that. And we've got that flow assurance covered. So I don't see us being forced into the choices that you just presented. I do -- as I said earlier, we're going to be increasing the amount of export capacity out of the basins to try and achieve better realizations and that's part of our overall strategy to maximize the returns that we can get from our investments in the Permian. \nPavel Molchanov: Okay. And then based on what I just asked, but taking on a much broader perspective. You're talking about reducing carbon emissions. Just about every other U.S. oil and gas producers talking about the same, when we listen to what's being said on stage at the debates, I'm sure you saw this week that point seems to be lost on the policy community. And I'm curious what you think the industry has not communicated that is -- or what the dynamic is that has led to this disconnect between what you're saying and what the policymakers seem to be believing?\nPierre Breber: Well Sam that's a big last question on the call here. Look I mean, it depends which policymaker is right. We're in the midst of a energy revolution, renaissance here in the United States. For sure, wind and solar is a big part of that, but what's going on in the Permian Basin, what's happened in the Marcellus and Utica and growing natural gas production, growing crude oil production, exports to world markets and all the geopolitical implications and benefits of that, you can see our President talk a lot about that. At the same time, if we shared the concerns on climate change. We referred on the earnings call to a couple of investments that lower the carbon intensity of our operations. It was wind PPA in the Permian, so we -- our consumer electricity are using renewable electricity there, lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the renewable natural gas, which is in California, which takes Methane that otherwise would be vented to the atmosphere processes it, puts it in the grid. I guess we have off-take agreements with trucking company. It generates low carbon fuel standards under the California Regulatory Regime. It's modest capital. It earns an attractive return, so it's something that we believe is good for the environment and good for our shareholders. So we look to do more of that. We'll be very balanced, but \u2013 it's a big question, and we'll be part of the conversation.\nJay Johnson: Thanks Pavel.\nPavel Molchanov: All right. Appreciate it.\nWayne Borduin: Well, I'd like to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Jonathan, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-04-26 15:50:18", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Mike Wirth. Please go ahead.\nMike Wirth: All right. Thank you, Jonathan and welcome back. We missed you. I'd like to welcome everybody to Chevron's first quarter earnings call and webcast. Our new CFO, Pierre Breber and our Head of Investor Relations Wayne Borduin are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement and important information for investors and stockholders on slide 2. Moving to slide 3, today, I'll make a few opening comments, Pierre will review first quarter results and then we'll take your questions.  As I've said before, we're well positioned to win in any environment. During our Security Analyst Meeting, we shared that our advantaged portfolio, strong balance sheet and low breakeven, capital discipline and lower execution risk position us well to deliver superior shareholder returns. With the announced acquisition of Anadarko, our story gets even better. It builds strength on strength. We submitted our anti-trust filing yesterday to begin regulatory approvals. And we've begun joint integration planning.  We know how to integrate two strong companies to create an even stronger one. We've done it well on prior transactions, and we'll do it again. We remain confident that the transaction agreed by Chevron and Anadarko will be completed.  With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre who will take you through the financial results.\nPierre R. Breber: Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide 4, our disciplined returns focused approach to the business continues to drive solid earnings and cash flow. First quarter earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.39 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange losses, earnings were $2.8 billion or $1.47 per share.  Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $5.1 billion. Excluding working capital changes, it was $6.3 billion. We maintained a strong balance sheet with a debt ratio less than 20% at quarter end. During the first quarter we increased our quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share, up 6%. Share repurchases during the quarter were around $500 million lower than our $1 billion per quarter guidance. During the quarter, we were restricted from buying back shares in light of the Anadarko acquisition.  Turning to slide 5, despite lower refining and chemical margins, cash flow was solid and the trend is in line with full year guidance. Working capital effects in the quarter consumed $1.2 billion, generally consistent with our seasonal pattern. Free cash flow, excluding working capital changes was over $3 billion. Other cash flow items included pension contributions of about $325 million asset sale proceeds of around $300 million and TCO co-lending of $350 million. \nOperator: Certainly  Our first question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nDevin McDermott : Great, good morning.\nMike Wirth: Good morning, Devin. \nDevin McDermott : So I wanted to start, so I'm sure it'll be asked if I don't, just on the Anadarko deal and the process there, appreciate the additional color in the prepared remarks. First, can you just walk through and remind is what the timeline is and key milestones and process from here, and any comments you can make on the competing off from RCU  would be helpful as well. I'll leave to you, is that how you like?\nMike Wirth: Sure. So the timeline is, probably a little different today than I would have told you a couple of weeks ago because we now have Anadarko\u2019s Board back considering a unsolicited proposal. We made -- our anti-trust filing. I mentioned that, that went in yesterday. We don't see any material, anti-trust or anti-competitive issues that arise from the combination, and so we would expect that to be handled within a pretty reasonable period of time, say 60 days. Depends if they come back for a second review with any questions. And then we have an Anadarko shareholder vote, that will be scheduled and could result in a third quarter close. \nDevin McDermott : Understood. Makes sense.\nMike Wirth: Thanks, Devin. Do you have a follow-up.\nDevin McDermott : Yeah, one follow up. I just wanted to shift over to TCO and the co-lending. You mentioned the guidance there is unchanged, but any color you can give us on the shaping and how we should think about that playing out throughout the year.\nPierre R. Breber: Yeah, Devon, this is Pierre, I mean, you should view it as you know, roughly ratable and but again, it'll vary depending on prices and project spending and affiliate dividends. But if you think of it being roughly ratable during the course of the year that's appropriate at this point in time.\nDevin McDermott : Thank you very much. \nMike Wirth: Thanks, Devin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.\nPhil Gresh: Hey, good morning. First question, in light of the competing bid that's put out there and the details behind that, I think one thing that surprised investors would be perhaps the degree of synergies that Occi talked about in their proposed transaction, even if you back out the capital reduction component. And so I think, you've been asked about the degree of conservatism already to some degree about your synergy forecast. But now that's out there, I was just wondering if maybe you'd have a comment about your numbers and where upside could come from.\nMike Wirth: Sure, Phil, so look, I'm not going to comment on the details of another offer. I'll tell you our synergies are real and we're confident, our ability to achieve the $2 billion in run rate synergies in the first year post close, and delivering significant value from the deal.  As I mentioned earlier, we've already begun joint integration meetings with Anadarko. We had full teams from both companies meeting for multiple days this week already. We're committed to delivering the synergies. We've got a strong history of successfully integrating two companies and meeting and often exceeding our synergy targets, this can go back to Gulf , it can go to Texaco, it can go to Unical .  And so this is something we've done before and we're very good at it, we're very confident that we can, that we can deliver the $2 billion. And as we know what we know, at this point, and as we get more detail, we certainly will know more. \nPhil Gresh: Okay, fair enough. Just a follow-up question would be, obviously there's more to an acquisition than just the price offered, and I was hoping maybe you could help us think through why your lower priced offer should win from your perspective, and if Anadarko's Board is forced to go back and quantitatively decide that this is -- your offer's not good enough, is there a point at which -- that if you look at this and -- not consider raising a bid, because its return's destructive  to you to do so.\nMike Wirth: Sure. Well I won't speak for the Anadarko Board, but even with the information that was made public this week our offer was viewed by Anadarko as superior. And we have a signed merger agreements approved unanimously by the Boards of both companies. We strongly believe the combination of our two companies create superior long term value for shareholders of the combined company. The industrial logic of our transaction is very compelling. Anadarko's assets further strengthen already leading positions that we have in large and attractive shale, deep water and natural gas basins. It enables a further portfolio high grade and cost reductions and focused investments and an even stronger company. Our financial position and balance sheet strength enables us to take on the leverage and issue the additional equity and still continue to increase shareholder distributions.  Our companies simply have the best strategic fit. We can operate in the Gulf of Mexico in ways that others cannot. We're a world class operator of LNG, we've got leading performance in many different dimensions in the Permian. And that strong balance sheet mitigates risk. We won't be over levered coming out of the deal, we will be financially strong, with accretive cash flow and earnings and full and certain value. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question please. \nPaul Sankey: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon from London. Mike, when we think about the potential for you to bid higher, we look at your balance sheet, and obviously there's a tremendous amount of firepower there, but we suspect it's not how you would be looking at potentially adding to your bid. Can you talk about the metrics that you're looking at in terms of Anadarko value to Chevron? Thank you.\nPierre R. Breber: Yeah, and I want to close off. Phil actually asked a question that I failed to get to at the end of that last answer, which kind of ties to this? And Phil, yes, there is a -- we've been very disciplined as we've approached this, as we've looked at valuation. And I think you said, is there a point at which you're done? And of course the answer to that is yes, there is. And this isn't the time to address that specifically, but we've said we will do things that are value creating for our shareholders and we don't need to do anything. We got a very strong story without doing a transaction.  So Paul, to your question, we look at a whole host of metrics. And some of the primary ones are the accretion metrics. Does this give us accretive free cash flow after capital spending, does it give us creative earnings, do we get a strong return on this investment, and does it give us the investment queue, the investment set and opportunities over time to continue to improve return on capital, which the entire industry is working to improve, and this does. It gives us over 10 billion barrels of resource at less than $3 a barrel, which is an attractive resource acquisition cost. And so there are a whole host of metrics like that, that are the ones that we look at. \nMike Wirth: Yeah, and, Paul, I don't know if your question was getting to the mix of the equity and cash. I mean, we've talked about the 75, 25 was mutually agreed to. Anadarko shareholders wanted exposure to our stock. We have a very good stock. But clearly we have the capacity to have alternative structures. We could put more -- we could have put more cash in if that's what Anadarko wanted to do, but we agreed to where we ended up.\nPaul Sankey: Yeah, I realize Mike, that you've talked about free cash flow, sort of point,  accretion I should say, from your point this needs to be the single metric that we should look at. We\u2019re just wondering how to think about that.\nMike Wirth: So Paul, sorry, Was there another follow-up question in there?\nPaul Sankey: No, I think the other aspect was that you said if you can't  up, which is obviously a tough thing to measure. But it does seem that you have a great fit. Could you talk a little bit about Mozambique and how you see that? I think that's one of the differentiators between potentially between you and Occi. Thanks.\nMike Wirth: Sure, as I discussed on the call a couple of weeks ago, we view Mozambique as a world class gas resource. We are pleased with the progress the product has made. It's a very cost competitive LNG project. And that matters. We do not intend to slow the project timeline down. We think that there's a good team of people working on this and that they've done a good job.  I plan to visit Mozambique soon to see the site and visit with both government leaders and people working on the project there. And we think that this fits well into our portfolio and with our strengths. And so we like the project. We think we can bring some value. We've got the balance sheet to support the project. We've got experience in things like shipping that, this will have a large shipping component. So I think there are ways we can improve and enhance execution and value and mitigate risk in execution of the project.  Thanks, Paul. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. \nJason Gammel: Thanks very much. I guess my first question is related to your ability to operate in the Permian. And the reason I say that is, the competing bidder has talked about their ability to create the most return enhancement and their superiority as an operator. So Mike can you address where you think you benchmark relative to competition in terms of Permian development right now?\nMike Wirth: Yeah, I mentioned earlier that we benchmark a wide range of metrics and you really need to look at performance in it's -- in all the dimensions. And there are ways that we've seen in the past Permian operators that will optimize certain metrics particular things like early production. We don't -- we are very careful about choke management to deliver the best ultimate recovery. But there are other operators that run with their chokes wide open and can show very strong early production numbers you look at it year out and there's quite a different picture that you see.  So I think number one, I would say you have to be very careful about which metrics you look at and we're focused on value creation and returns. Short-term production is not the goal and we're really looking at driving ultimately long-term recoveries, capital efficient model that generates leading EURs, a low cost per barrel and high returns and you take that you put it together with an advantage royalty position and we can deliver value that is difficult for anyone else to match.  And over time a company like ours has a technology capacity that few others have and we can add even more value as we drive costs down further as we improve recoveries and we see technology do what it always does, which is unlock greater degrees of performance. And so I will simply say that we look at our metrics and performance through a value lens and not a production lens. \nJason Gammel: Appreciate that Mike. My follow-up question is at the time you announced the transaction you did raise the target on annual buybacks to 5 billion from what it had been before. I appreciate the run rates right now are affected by the transaction being in the public domain. But was the 5 billion -- was it increased to 5 billion contingent upon the deal completing or is that a run rate you would expect to have regardless.\nMike Wirth: It was an announcement we made to indicate our strong confidence in the cash flow accretive and value creation that this transaction enables and so it is tied to the transaction, and as I said we got a strong case pre-existing the transaction with increase from a run rate of 3 billion last year to run rate of 4 billion this year and so the step up to five was a signal that this deal makes us even stronger. \nPierre R. Breber: Yeah, if I can just clarify on again the first quarter buybacks were lower as Jason as you said we had to stop buying back shares, we thought there was prudent when we believe we could be we could find yourself in possession material nonpublic information related to transaction. So we expect these restrictions to continue in the second quarter circumstances could change and we could be able to buybacks shares in time to time but right expect low to no buybacks in the second quarter. And then post-closing, we intent to increase the rate to the $5 billion annual or $1.25 billion per quarter.\nJason Gammel: Understood. Thanks guys.\nMike Wirth: Thanks Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please. \nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just have one, on your expiration strategy and this also relates to Anadarko. But we look a long by the Permian in terms of synergies but it seems that is also quite little bit upside to exploration in the that if you combine the two portfolio and follow a infrastructure lead expiration strategy.  Could you just talk a little bit about that and how you thinking about that on the basis that this transaction just closed? And then the second question is there was a couple of articles in the year around you transferring your Permian royalty interest into a new subsidiary I was wondering if there is anything to that or that just a non-news. Thank you. \nMike Wirth: Okay, so the first one expiration in the Gulf of Mexico. We talked earlier about that we would see expiration synergies as we bring the two companies together and our expiration portfolios. And we talked about the fact that we would have a very powerful infrastructure position in the Deepwater. When you combine that with extended reach tiebacks which we're in the final phases of technical qualifications to significantly expand the tiebacks that we can do.  We can cover a lot of the Gulf of Mexico without necessarily needing new surface infrastructure and this allows us to begin to explore for accumulations that might not be economic on a standalone basis to For accumulations that might not be economic on a standalone basis to support a new Greenfield project, but that could be developed through drilling and tie back into existing infrastructures, platforms as, as All Ridge opens up.  And so it really enables a very different approach to exploration and I think a much higher return, shorter cycle, lower risk way to look at the next phase of development in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Not to say we might not have some Greenfield projects, because certainly there could be circumstances where that becomes the right economic outcome.  I\u2019d also point out that we -- we're an equity holder in a discovery that was just announced this week, the Blacktip Discovery, which Shell is the operator on encountered over 400 feet of net pay, it's about 30 miles away from Perdido and whale.  So we continue to see discoveries and we've got great strength in an area that has tremendous resource opportunity. And the challenge is to find ways to deliver it and generate better returns out of that.  Your question on the Permian royalty, what we've done is consolidated all of our royalties into an entity which allows us to manage that royalty with focus and efficiency and insure that as activity in the Permian continues to grow, and we have a strong royalty position that royalty is properly accounted for collected and managed. It certainly opens up options to do things that you've seen others do. I don't want to indicate that we would or would not do that. But it certainly positions us with an entity that could enable those kinds of alternatives if at some point we saw that as one that was desirable.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. \nNeil Mehta: Good morning team and Congrats, Pierre again on the new role. So the first question I had was actually on the oil macro. Two months away from the OPEC meeting. Prices have clearly been very firm here off bottom in 2019. Mike just wanted your perspective on some of the moving pieces as it relates to the oil macro. Has your view that we're an age of abundance fundamentally changed as you've had a more conservative worldview?  Or do you think price has been artificially lifted by OPEC cuts and how do you think about OPEC behavior from here, not asking you to forecast the price but your unique position to comment given the fact that you play across the value chain and you operate in some of these countries?\nMike Wirth: Yeah, so\u2026\nPierre R. Breber: Let me give you my best shot on that one today, Neil. You know, global demand continues to be strong. We're seeing demand go up by, over a million barrels per day again this year, we had a very strong GDP number for the first quarter in the U.S., I think, surprisingly strong that has come out. Today. and, you know, we've consistently said that we don't see evidence of weakening around the world. We're across the value chain in many different products and many different geographies.  So, our economic growth looks solid and oil demand growth continues to march upward. You know, at the end of last year, as we saw some weakness, there were concerns about trade in China and economic activity and those have somewhat receded.  On the supply side, you've got the usual set of dynamics underway, right. We've got geopolitical issues with the Iran waivers not being extended, which creates the prospect of some tightness Venezuela continues to be very difficult, Libya is in and out of the news. And so you have some of the same things that create concerns and real tightness, in some cases on the supply side, and then you have OPEC plus the non-OPEC countries, which for the last couple of years, maybe three years or so have demonstrated the resolve to manage their supply in a way that's consistent with more stable markets. You throw on top of that commentary from the President, which again today, I guess he's out with comments about OPEC. And I think you still have OPEC in a place where they do play a role in creating a forward expectation on the supply side. And so in some ways the dynamics while the specifics of which countries might have supply issues and how the global demand picture rich countries might have supply issues and how the global demand picture shapes up. It's a story of forward expectations on supply and demand and then the geopolitical overlay that can change that.  Fundamentally, we still believe that the world needs more of all types of energy and so we're in favor of renewable energy, we're in favor of conventional energy and economics markets and technology sorting out what the best mix is each country around the world. There is no shortage of resource to be developed. And so a cost matter and we continue to drive to be very competitive from a cost and supply standpoint. So I'm not I gave anything really brand new there, but that\u2019s how I see it. \nNeil Mehta : That's helpful. The follow up from our side is if we were to take the Anadarko transaction out of the equation, one of the concerns, some investors have expressed over the course of the year has been the Chevron have the portfolio that will drive in 2023 to 2028. And you kind of gave us some flavor of what that looks like at the Analyst Day post the Permian Ramp and post thingies what's the next wage of growth and sort of it begs the question was the Anadarko eventual transaction and all sense this transaction where a these types of transaction. So I just want to give you an opportunity to respond to that, because I think your view here is that you do have a standalone opportunities at independent transaction but certainly something that's been brought up by investors. \nMike Wirth: Yeah, absolutely, I said it in March, and I will say it. so again we do not have resource anxiety, we've been replacing reserves. We've got nearly 70 billion barrels of resource. We've given transparency on the production outcome for five years because people have wanted to see a longer view on that. And so you see this 3% to 4% growth now steadily being delivered over five years which is been difficult for companies to do consistently over an extended period of time at the scale that our company operates.  We're very confident that we can do that. and we stopped at five years just as a matter of convention not because we think there is a problem after that. And so unconventionals don't flatten out after that.  Our Permian position has got decades of resource not a few years. We tried to highlight our other shale and type resource position which are in the very early stages of development and continue to have very strong performance metrics and economics that our converging on Permian level economics which is really the goal that we've put in front of them. I've already talked on a call a little bit about deepwater where we've got Anchored Baltimore, Whale, Blacktip now.  We've got the ability to bring tie backs into a larger system or into the existing system, your question is ex the Anadarko transaction. We've got acreage in Brazil in Mexico in West Africa. So there are positions around the world and we've got, we're still operating in Venezuela where there is an enormous amount of resource and one day that will begin to be developed again. We got production offline and the partition zone.  I'll stop there but I'll simply say that the opportunities for us to invest in and develop resource that we hold today extends well beyond 2023 and it's a function of which projects competes the best for capital investments. A lot of short cycle stuff in there that is a pretty low risk and then there are some longer cycle things that are large and I think you'll see a blend of those deliver strong economic outcomes which is what drives our decision not production targets, but I think the cupboard is full not empty. \nNeil Mehta : Thanks guys. \nMike Wirth: Thanks Neil. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Simmons Energy. Your question please?\nBlake Fernandez : Thanks guys good morning. Pierre I'm sorry to flag the buyback, but I just want to make sure I'm 100% clear on this. Is it fair to say 2Q buyback should essentially be zero and assuming that is the case, even when you ramp up to 1.25 per quarter, obviously than on a full year basis, we're going to come in below that $4 billion number due to Anadarko deal. Is that the correct way to look at it. \nPierre R. Breber: Yeah, essentially and let me just restate it. So yeah, the $4 billion guidance was -- did not anticipate the transaction or an acquisition at the time. There are two sort of restrictions that we're operating under. One is when we're in possession of material non-public information we're not allowed to buy back shares. Even if and when that clears itself there are other restrictions on buybacks when there is a business combination happening and equities being issued.  So you can't buybacks during the proxy solicitation are other limitations on buybacks versus historical rates. So we're just operating under a different regime here during the transaction. Post-closing absolutely we have talked about the gross debt ratio being below 20%. Lots of capacity to increase it. So there could be some buybacks but again the guidance is low or no buybacks in the second quarter and then when we get post-closing, we will be a able to achieve the guidance and won't be encumbered by restrictions tied to the acquisition. \nBlake Fernandez: Very clear, thank you. The second question is really on the Permian and the more on the gas side. I know you've worked a lot to get firm take away capacity on the crude side, Wahoo pricing is been really weak. Can you talk about, I guess what alleviation avenues you have on that side as far as take away or improving your price realizations as you continue to grow there?\nMike Wirth: Yeah, I will take that Blake and then Pierre might have some perspective as well. We have got take away capacity for all our production and so whether it's oil, NGLs or gas we are moving it and taking it to market. We are not engaged in routine flaring and would not intends to flare gas to enable production. And we had little bit of dry gas.  So if you don't have liquids right now, sometimes it's better just keep that gas in the ground for a better market. Our current production in the Permian is 75% liquids and 25% gas. We're focusing on liquid rich ventures, and as we described and you alluded to we been looking at take away capacity several quarters ahead of our production the entire time here.  I think what you've seen in the market is something that you should expect to see for a number of years in the future, which is you got a lot of people out there that are developing resource, you got a lot of people, investing in the midstream infrastructure and there are going to be times when those all sync up and you see pretty normal transportation type differentials and you'll see other periods of time where the market may anticipate some tightness and you will see the differentials widen out.  I know Wahoo has been pretty ugly here lately. Kinder Morgan's got some pipes that come online this year and next year, which would probably start to change that equation, you know, the Mexico market has been a little slow to come than people expected. And we got some Wahoo exposure in our portfolio, but it's not anything that is material in the scope of our company and I think we're, like I said we are well positioned on the take away capacity across all the commodities quarter production in the future. \nBlake Fernandez: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby from UBS. Your question please.\nJonathon Rigby: Thanks for taking my question. It's around the CapEx side and the capital side of the transaction actually. The first is something I don\u2019t think has got enough attention is the high grading process that will that you intend to indulge in after the deal closes. I just wanted to explore that because as we think about -- as we start to look at the future combination, we need to think about what it is you might be doing around that.  So I just wanted to confirm whether you see that as part of the value proposition, there's actually value to be delivered through that disposal process of the portfolio management that you can do.  Second is whether that processes is already underway? And thirdly, whether you can maybe lift the curtain a little and give us some idea about not necessarily assets but the kind of thought that you have around the type of portfolio you'd like to merge with, the things that you will be, the criteria which will be using.  And then the second question if I would just add somewhat lengthy. The billion dollars of CapEx efficiencies that you identified as part of the transaction, can you confirm that those are about doing the same thing for less, rather than just ramping down activities so we just can't compare like-for-like. Thanks.\nMike Wirth: Okay, well, there is a lot in there, Jon. That was well done. So let me start with the portfolio and try to frame that up for you. And then I'll come to the capital.  You asked about the process, we've got an ongoing process where we look at and high grading our portfolio. You know, we've had $2 billion to $3 billion in assets sales kind of on average, over a long period of time. We're continuing, always looking to high grade that portfolio from a strategic alignment standpoint, the ability to compete for capital, what the assets are, that will allow us to compete and deliver strong returns into the future. And oftentimes those may not be the same ones that satisfied that criteria in the past. As I thought last week, I mentioned to people if you go back about 15 years, when you think about our upstream portfolio, Tengiz was our real flagship asset. It was in the process of an expansion with SGI SGP that took 100% production from 350 to 650 or 7,000 barrels a day, our share of that was half. So we were on the way to the asset that we have today. And the Permian was kind of out of sight out of mind for most people.  Our Australia LNG projects had not been sanctioned, none of our LNG products have been sanctioned. And we were just beginning to move on off the shelf into the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. If you think about it today, in Australia, we're producing 400,000 barrels of equivalent at nice cash margins. Tengiz is on its way to a million barrels a day on 100% basis, our share half of that, so 500,000 a day.  The Permian we outlined is on its way to 900,000 barrels a day, our share and it doesn't stop when we get to that number. The Deepwater is with the combination the two companies is pushing close to 400,000 a day. So we now have four positions that have scale, that have resource depth and length, that have strong economics, that have lots of running room. And we have the ability to drive costs down and returns up through the way we manage and invest in those resources over time.  So it's a very different portfolio than when we would have had. Just one smaller asset and a lot of other ones that we\u2019re required to have the scale to compete. So we need to take a look at the rest of our portfolio and determine those assets that really can\u2019t still compete for capital and offer the low cost, high return characteristics, the resource length, and will compete for capital over time. I hope you're still with us, Jon, it sounds like you might be back\u2026 \nJonathon Rigby: Yes, sorry. It's the classic timing of the annual -- the weekly test, apologies for that.\nMike Wirth: All right, I'll be quick so you can comply. So we got a different portfolio and we will look to make some decisions on those assets that really will compete for capital that offer the resource potential and the value for our shareholders over time, what those are we will disclose as we get into transactions.  The capital that we've indicated -- you should think of it as both reductions in spend between the two companies and efficiency in that spent. So we'll look at contracts and the ability to execute and drive capital efficiency into the system and also drive overall spend down, while at the same time investing more in the Permian, which is what we indicated our intention is to do. So we will squeeze capital out of the combined system, we will squeeze efficiency into the combined system. And we will find ways to accelerate activity in the Permian which will bring value forward. \nPierre R. Breber: And just to add, and we maintained a 3% to 4% guidance on production through 2023 as a combined company. \nJonathon Rigby: Right, cool. Thank you and I'm perfectly safe. Thank you. \nMike Wirth: Okay. I'm glad to hear that, Jon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nRoger Read: Yeah. Good morning. Hopefully, you can hear me and I don't believe there are any problems in the background right now. I guess, Mike kind of an unusual situation here in terms of the bidding and typically you put your teams together, you expect them to be very focused going forward. I was wondering in an environment like this, do you end up having to divert people's attention to dealing with what may be an ongoing process here in terms of the Anadarko bid. And then how do you think about managing your way through that, kind of keeping everybody doing the things they need to do, plus the team that's focused here on the merger and integration and all that stuff?\nMike Wirth: Look, I mentioned that we've put together joint integration teams already and that they met this week. And this isn't just a small group of people. This was a sizable group of people that spent multiple days together. And we've got a playbook for doing this. We did Unical a decade ago, Texaco a few years before that. We have some of the same people involved that lead those integrations. And and so, people have their eye on the ball and are focused on moving forward with things.  So just to remind everybody, we've got a signed deal that's been approved by both boards. And we're moving forward with integration planning so we can deliver value.\nRoger Read: Okay, well, good luck on that. Maybe to flip back and actually think about the operations here. In the quarter. We saw a little lighter on the gas side globally, stronger on the crude side. Just curious how much of that is we had some unplanned downtime I believe in Australia with the LNG. As you look going for this kind of global mix between oil and gas and taking into account maybe some dry gas remain shut into the Permian for a while.\nMike Wirth: Yeah, I mean, I do think what you saw was primarily some downtime at one of the trends in Australia Gorgon. And because that's a bigger part of our portfolio now and we've got a train down for some work we will see that. The dry gas isn't a big number and so I wouldn't worry about that too much. There's also some weather in Australia that they create an impact. There's a cyclone that came through and we had to take some slowdowns at both Wheatstone and Gorgon, as we rode through that. So but those are really the things that are hitting the gas production.\nRoger Read: Just real quick, if I could follow up on that, is there any plan downtime between Gorgon and Wheatstone we should consider as we look at the rest of the year?\nMike Wirth: Yeah, we're moving into normal turnaround mode now for both of those. The plan at Gorgon would be to only have one train down in any given year. And so our plan right now would be to execute train one on Gorgon later this year. The upstream in aggregate from a turnaround standpoint, the turnaround season begins really in the second quarter. You can think about the third quarter as probably the heaviest quarter because we'll have one of the KTL lines at TCO in turnaround there. And then as we go third into fourth quarter, you'll see one train at Gorgon down for a turnaround. But it's we're into the normal operations and turnaround cycle with LNG plants. \nPierre R. Breber: And Roger, this is Pierre. I mean, we generally will provide guidance if there's heavy upstream turnaround activity in the earnings call.\nRoger Read: Appreciate that. Thank you guys. \nPierre R. Breber: Thanks, Roger.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.\nDoug Leggate: Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting on the call. Mike. As you know, we are big fans of what you guys have done here, but I want to ask a little bit of a sensitive question, if I may. There's been some speculation, I guess, some fact checking in the press that given the Anadarko already had a bid in hands from Occi, as per their letter, they then went ahead and increased their change of control for their senior management. I wonder if you could speak to your opinion on that. And how what perspective you would offer in terms of perhaps the history of your, your discussions that may be led to that point. Obviously it's a little bit sensitive, but it's something that some shareholders are raising some concern about.\nMike Wirth: Yeah, Doug, there are numerous aspects of our negotiation in the deal that will be explained in the S4 filing, it is premature and inappropriate for me to comment on any of the aspects of how this all came together. I'd encourage you just to read the S4 when it's filed.\nDoug Leggate: Okay, I knew it was going to be a tough one to answer. So I appreciate you trying. My more specific question to Gorgon . Obviously post deal, those are going to be a very significant tailwind from synergies and all the things that you've laid out. One assumes that if you did match the higher bid, does that change anything by way of your buy plans, that would then go through that to any of those kind of issues. And what I'm really getting at is that if for some reason you did hit a high bar or you did not decide to move forward and not event I realize it's unlikely, but the bulk of your future growth due to '2023 is largely it looks like a lot of it is coming from Permian gas.  So I'm just curious how absent this deal, would you be able to sustain the buybacks and commit to a strong growth trajectory for dividends? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nMike Wirth: Yeah, I'm not going to speculate on what Anadarko\u2019s Board may do and how that plays out. I'll just tell you in our base case, we produce 75% liquids in the Permian. So it's not primarily gas. We've indicated that we expect to see our industry leading cash margins sustained as the production grows. And that we've initiated a buyback program that we intend to stick with through any reasonable commodity price environment. And so there are not risks to the cash that would support shareholder distributions here in the vein of what you're talking about. So we're very confident in the plan we've laid out and our ability to deliver. Thanks, Doug. \nMike Wirth: Good luck. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nMike Wirth: Sam. Might be muted.\nSam Margolin: Can you hear me now. \nMike Wirth: Yes, we can. \nSam Margolin: Just muted. Sorry about that. I just have a quick question. We've been through a lot on the Anadarko topic already. I've got a question for Pierre, a follow up to the TCO topic earlier. You know, if TCO keeps taking up the co-lending program, theoretically, it's to preserve dividends. But if that's happening at the same time that commodity prices are broadly higher than what was planned for, does that flow into the Chevron Capital program as sort of like a net cash surprise or is the authorization part of your sort of free cash flow outlook and it's not dynamic what TCO decides to do?  And then just as a follow-up, like if it's the former, does Chevron then have headroom to rotate cash at the Chevron level into other things like Permian, incremental Permian, for example.\nPierre Breber: Yeah, thanks. No, the financing doesn't impact capital, how we characterize capital. So the capital is going to be what is invested in the project. Again, that's affiliate capital. So non cash capital. What can vary is where I thought you were going is if prices are higher than there's clearly more cash generation within TCO and therefore their ability to balance making investments and paying dividends is easier. And you might pull less on the loan. So again, we're giving guidance on the financing but it is subject to prices -- level of investments that are happening and the level of dividends. All of those are in interplay.  But if prices stay higher, longer than that gives them more flexibility to either decrease the lending or the borrowings or increase the dividends. In either case, that's more cash to the company, it shows up in different parts of the cash flow statement. But in either case, does not affect CapEx.\nSam Margolin: Okay, yeah, that's why I was asking because it sounded like there was a potential outcome where TCO is self-funding and inclusive of the dividend, but they still uptake the co-lending, in which case, you've got like surplus cash, but I guess it's not, it wouldn't affect anything else. So okay. All right, thank you very much. \nMike Wirth: Thanks, Sam.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Your question, please. \nJason Gabelman: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I'm not going to ask about the Anadarko, deal, because it seems like it's been covered on the call. I want to actually ask about what's going on in California right now, just given you guys are -- have a pretty big footprint in the state Congress is in the process of reviewing a bill to kind of institute a change in how oil production goes on there, kind of the setback rule similar to what Colorado tried to put forth. I'm wondering, what do you see as potential risks, if any, to your portfolio in the state, both on the refining side, and the production side, relative to that regulation? Thanks.\nMike Wirth: Okay. Jason. Yeah. So California has pretty aggressive ideas on regulating our industry and what you referred to is AB 345 which is in the assembly right now, wouldn\u2019t impact downstream at all. It's really -- you think of it is analogous to what has been going on in Colorado and the primary concern is setbacks for activity. Our portfolio in California is primarily in the San Joaquin Valley and it tends to be an area where it's not populated the same way the LA basin is, which is where historically there was a lot of the roots of our company and a lot of the industry trace their way back into the LA basin.  And so there you got a much more densely populated urban and suburban land-use metrics and concerns about the proximity of drilling activities to residential schools commercial et cetera is really what's behind this.  So we're working closely with state government to ensure they understand the impacts, others in industry and trade associations are as well. And so it's prospective legislation that is being considered here. It really impact permitting for new wells doesn't impact things that are already in production and we get a big producing business that's online today and then I think our portfolio is in part of the state that would likely be less impacted than if our production were more heavily concentrated into the LA basin. \nMike Wirth: Okay, thank you very much. Jason I think we are right about the top of the hour here and I know everybody's busy on a Friday. So want to thank everyone for your time today. Appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on the call today.  Jonathan back over to you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. "}], "2021": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2021-01-29 18:13:09", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead, sir.\nWayne Borduin: Thank you, Audra. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call and webcast. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. Also listening in today is Roderick Green, the incoming General Manager of Investor Relations who will assume the position effective April 1. Roderick and I will be transitioning together over the next couple of months. It has been my sincere pleasure working with each of you over the last three years. Thank you for your excellent questions, transparent feedback and investments in Chevron. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Wirth: All right. Thanks, Wayne. 2020 was an unprecedented year. The global pandemic resulting in a devastating loss of life and historic collapse in the global economy and extremely volatile oil markets. We began the year in a strong position and we took swift action to adapt to the new realities as they emerged. During last year's first quarter call, we shared our plan to manage through the crisis, grounded in our values and keeping our strategic and financial priorities intact. Looking back, I'm pleased to say that we delivered on each of these five commitments, which I'll cover on the next slides. First and foremost, we focused on the safety of our employees and our operations. Despite the difficult personal challenges faced by everyone in our workforce and the additional health safeguards at our operating facilities, 2020 was our second safest year ever in terms of fatalities and our best ever on serious injuries, motor vehicle crashes and loss of containment. And it was also the year with the greatest and most rapid change in market conditions. Our upstream team had to quickly and safely demobilize dozens of rigs and reduce other production activities. Our refining personnel had to figure out how to make as little jet fuel as possible, even though just weeks before jet was the fastest-growing refined product. Despite all this, our upstream delivered more than 3 million barrels per day for only the second time in the company's history. And our refineries maintained world-class availability to deliver the energy required for essential workers in a recovering economy. I'm so proud of our employees how they carried out the responsibilities with excellence and help each other in during this extraordinary year rose to overcome the unprecedented challenges. Turning to capital and cost management. During last year's Investor Day, we told you our capital program was flexible. Just weeks after we said that, we proved it. 2020 capital was down 35% from 2019. Inorganic capital, excluding incremental C&E from Noble in the fourth quarter, was under $13 billion, well below our revised guidance of $14 billion. We also exceeded our guidance for operating cost savings. Excluding special items, OpEx was down by over $1 billion this year, with decreases due to reduced activity levels and lower transportation, fuel, and incentive compensation costs. This demonstrates our ongoing cost and capital discipline, something you can count on and a key to winning in this industry. Moving to the next slide. We entered and exited the 2020 crisis with an industry-leading balance sheet, while also completing a major acquisition. Early in 2020, we increased our dividend over 8%. We also bought back shares. When the crisis hit and cash from operations decreased, we took action to halt the buyback and protect our balance sheet. We completed asset sales, received good value and finished our three-year high-grading program in the middle of our guidance range. Being prepared with a strong balance sheet, consistent with an ongoing asset sales program and adaptive on share repurchases enabled us to increase our annual dividend payout for the 33rd consecutive year. And the actions we took to preserve long-term value, which I'll cover on the next slide, should give our shareholders confidence that we intend to sustain and grow the dividend in the future. Turning to Slide 7. While we reduced short-cycle capital that would bring on near-term production, we maintained capital for projects that we expect t deliver production and attractive cash flow for years, like our expansion project in Kazakhstan. And in the Permian Basin and other short-cycle basins, we preserved the capability to build investment back up when the conditions are right. In addition, we were the first to announce and complete a major acquisition showing the way with a low premium equity deal at an opportune time. And as a result, our total investment over 2020 and 2021 will likely be in line with our pre-crisis guidance, but we'll get there in a much different way, with much lower organic capital that would have added more barrels to already over-supplied markets, offset by an acquisition for low-cost barrels already producing. That also translated to reserve replacement, with additions from the Noble acquisition mitigating reserve demotions from reduced capital investments and price effects as disclosed in last year's 10-Qs. Committed employees, capital and cost discipline, decisive actions that balance the short and long-term, that was our playbook to manage through this crisis. And while we're not out of it yet, we look to the future with optimism. We believe we're better positioned than others, confident in our ability to succeed in any environment. Turning to Slide 8. I'm also proud that we maintained our commitment to ESG, a commitment we've long held and one that doesn't ebb and flow with market cycles. We increased actions to advance to a lower carbon future, abating emissions in our operations, starting up our first renewable natural gas plants and investing in low-carbon technologies like our recent announcement with carbon utilization start-up, Blue Planet. We completed our largest company restructuring in 20 years and integration of Noble employees in a transparent and equitable manner. We maintained positive relationships with our suppliers and supported relationships with communities where we operate. Lastly, we continued strong governance which starts with our exceptional Board of Directors during an unprecedented year to meet the interests of all our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Mike. We reported a net loss of $700 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings were about break-even. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Excluding working capital changes, cash flow from operations was almost $4 billion for the quarter. Our Brent oil cash break-even price, excluding working capital, was under $50 for the second quarter in a row. T&E was $3.2 billion, including about $200 million for legacy Noble assets. Full-year financial results were significantly lower due to weak market conditions, as reflected by an adjusted ROCE near zero. We remain committed to improving returns on capital, and we'll share more about our plans to do so at our Investor Day in March. Total shareholder distributions, including first quarter buybacks, were $11.4 billion. And we ended the year with a net debt ratio in the low 20s after the assumption of Noble debt and its step-up to market value. Turning to Slide 10. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were down about $200 million compared to third quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings increased, primarily due to higher volumes from Noble Energy and higher commodity prices. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased due to negative timing effects, including an end of the year inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million, higher operating expenses primarily due to turnarounds and higher RIN credit prices. The other segment decreased primarily due to higher pension charges related to lumpsum elections. Turning to our full-year earnings. Adjusted earnings decreased by over $12 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower prices. An underlift and the mix effect of higher U.S. and lower international liftings also lowered earnings.  Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower volumes than margins, unfavorable timing effects and higher RIN and other credit prices. The other segment loss increased primarily due to higher pension expense. Slide 12 shows our production outlook for 2021, assuming a $50 Brent price. We expect production to be up to 3% higher than last year excluding the impact of any asset sales that may close in 2021. Our projected growth is driven by a full-year production from the Noble Energy assets and lower expected curtailments, partially offset by higher base declines, in part due to lower capital last year, price effects and accounting change in Venezuela, 2020 asset sales and upcoming contract expirations. Note that our Rokan concession in Indonesia expires in August of this year. And while our contract in Thailand does not expire until March of next year, production is decreasing due to the short time to earn a return on new investments. Now, looking ahead, in the first quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia. Gorgon Train 1 repairs are nearing completion and we expect the facility to be back online in March. After Train 1 is back online, Train 3 will be taken out of service for the propane vessel inspections, any repairs and the planned turnaround. At Wheatstone, production is modestly below capacity while we repair and inlet separator. We do not expect production impacts in the second quarter. The impact from ongoing OPEC plus curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Kazakhstan. At TCO, our project workforce reached 20,000 by year-end before we paused due to a virus resurgence. Next month, we expect to resume re-mobilization for the spring campaign and are targeting a project workforce of 26,000 by the end of the first quarter. In Indonesia, we expect cost recovery barrels to decrease 75,000 barrels per day from last quarter. One-time pre-funding for drilling and ARO commitments in the fourth quarter contributed to the working capital build. We expect these receivables to reverse the third quarter. In downstream, turnaround activity in the first quarter is expected to have an estimated after-tax earnings impact of $100 million to $200 million. Other financial guidance items are shown on the slide. With that, back to Mike for his closing comments.\nMike Wirth: All right, thanks, Pierre. 2020 was a year like no other. And while there are uncertainties and challenges ahead, we are optimistic about the future. We are stronger with Noble, which adds geographic diversity and plays to our strengths. We're starting the year with an industry-leading balance sheet again. We are executing a disciplined investment program that grows enterprise value with greater capital efficiency. We remain committed to our number one financial priority, sustaining and growing the dividend, and we're advancing a lower carbon future with actions that are good for the environment and good for shareholders. We hope that you'll join us on March 9 to discuss these topics and more during our 2021 Chevron Investor Day. With that, I'll turn it back to Wayne.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks Mike. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue. So please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Audra, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Devin McDermott at Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The first one I had here was just on the capital allocation strategy as we think about the next few years and you put the release out back in December cutting the capital budgeted over the next several years to $14 billion to $16 billion. And as part of that, noted that as Tengiz spending in Kazakhstan rolls off, you would increase spending in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico. And I was wondering if you could comment on the role of those U.S. assets in your portfolio in light of the current policy and regulatory backdrop, particularly the Gulf of Mexico, how you're thinking about that U.S. concentrated investment strategy in light of current policies?\nMike Wirth: Yes. Thanks, Devin. Look, there is a couple of things that I think are important to recognize. Number one, not only have we transitioned over the last few years into what I would describe as a structurally lower ongoing capital program. But number two, it contains a much greater degree of flexibility, and we mentioned we pulled spending down 35% really over just nine months last year because we could flex that downward. And so we have a great degree of flexibility. We've got a high degree of capital efficiency in our portfolio. And even at these further reduced levels of spending, as Pierre mentioned, the production will be somewhere between flat and up 3%. So we've got a capital program that we like. And as the TCO project comes down, we've got room to make choices. When we issued the press release, certainly, the Permian and the Gulf of Mexico would have been some of the first places to draw that capital back. As we look at some of the announcements of this week and developments that seem to be unfolding here in the U.S., it's early days to understand exactly how these will play out. The executive order was sweeping and broad, but it also lacked some specificity. And I think, certainly, as you listen to some of the members of the new administration comment as they introduced this and answered some questions, I think, they're looking to flesh out the details here in the coming weeks and months. And we certainly hope to be engaged in those conversations. Onshore in the Permian, we're weighted towards Texas, more so the New Mexico, we're weighted toward private land more so than federal land. So we've got a fair degree of flexibility there. And that remains a highly attractive place for us to step capital up as we have the capacity to do so and the market conditions support it. So I think the Permian equation looks pretty similar to what it did at the time we made those statements. At deepwater Gulf of Mexico, I think we just have to see how this unfolds. And certainly, we like the projects that we're advancing here and there has been, I think, general signaling that existing leases are secure and we would presume the permitting that would go with those leases is also likely to proceed. But there are questions about this that I think we're just going to have to work our way through. So the risks are probably greater in the Gulf of Mexico, that was probably the lower part of the capital step-up that we might have envisioned at any rate. So I think we'll be able to manage our way through it, but stay tuned, we'll keep talking to you about this as we go forward and, of course, we've got options outside of the U.S. as well. And I think that's important, too. Just bear in mind, if conditions in the U.S. become so onerous, that it really disincentivizes investment, we've got other places where we can take those dollars.\nDevin McDermott: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And then my second question is just on TCO and Kazakhstan, I was wondering if you could give us just an update on progress there and how things are progressing versus your expectations?\nMike Wirth: Yes. So quickly, I'll reiterate that, last year, we completed all module fabrication and all the transportation to get the modules through the Russian inland waterway systems through the Caspian unloaded into site. That's a really important milestone because those were risks that could have extended things had we not accomplished that. Progress overall in the project is about 81%. At this point, construction is about 60% complete. And as Pierre said, we've remobilized 20,000 workers to the project. We plateaued at that number now, because Tengiz is experiencing some of the same wintertime uptick in Coronavirus cases as you're seeing around the world. And so we - we're holding at 20,000 right now. We've had to quarantine certain portions of the workforce there for certain periods of time. We plan to restart further mobilization in February, and as Pierre said, targeting 26,000 by the end of the first quarter. We'll need to get some progress under our belt here to really see data on productivity. There's a lot of work that hasn't been done over the last - going on a year now as this has been impacting us. And so we're working on optimizing schedules and work plans and understanding what the full impact of that is. It's hard to quantify that until we really are back at work, and certainly in the wintertime, things tend to slowdown, summertime, they will pick up. And so we need to see our ability to sustain the workforce there to get work done productively and begin to chew into this backlog that has built up and we will keep you advised as to what that looks like. Jay will be with us at the Investor Day in six weeks, and he will give you more detail at that point in time. I don't believe by that point in time, we will have enough activity that we've seen where we'll be able to give you a highly reliable specific update on cost and schedule. But we will be working on that and we will get it to you when we've got enough data to give you something that we think is really useful.\nDevin McDermott: Great. Thank you so much.\nMike Wirth: You bet.\nOperator: We'll move next to Phil Gresh at JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh: Hey, good morning.\nMike Wirth: Good morning, Phil.\nPhil Gresh: The first question, the 2021 production guidance, the high end growth of 3% is slightly below where consensus is here. And you gave some color there on Gorgon and Wheatstone for the first quarter, which was very helpful. So I guess is it fair to assume that the extent of the downtime at Gorgon and Wheatstone that's in your guidance is just kind of what's in the first quarter? And just maybe any color on what you're factoring in for the Permian as well for 2021? Thank you.\nMike Wirth: Yes, I mean, the first thing I'll say, Phil, and I know everybody looks at production, but it's an outcome, and we're running the company to deliver financial results and we let the production be what it is. Pierre gave you a guide for first quarter on Gorgon and Wheatstone, Wheatstone for the rest of the year should be back up to full capacity until the turnaround that begins late third quarter and runs into fourth, which we had already planned and announced. And then, of course, at Gorgon, as Pierre mentioned, Train 3 will have inspection of these propane exchangers and a plan to turnaround here in the second quarter of this year. So we will be lighter on Australia production, then where everything up and running for a full year, but a big part of that is planned turnaround activity and then there is an increment related to these repairs. In the Permian, there's two pieces to think about. Overall Permian production will be up because we've added production from Noble. I think we've previously guided to kind of a 6% to 7% decline on the Chevron legacy production, that actually today looks like it will be a little less steep, maybe more like a 5% decline on Chevron legacy production in 2021 versus 2020, and that's with flat activity levels running five rigs and one or two completion crews over the course of the year, and a little bit of this will be dependent upon what NOJV partners do. We ended the year last year with about 1.4 net rigs in the Permian on the NOJV, seven gross, our share about 1.4. In January, it's up a little bit to about 2.5 net rigs, 10 gross. So there's a little bit of perhaps upside depending upon what Non-Operated JV partners do. But those are the key pieces there on both Australia and the Permian for production.\nPierre Breber: And Phil, I'll just add that Venezuela year-on-year is downright. We changed our accounting midyear last year to where we're no longer booking production and reserves associated with those operations. We do continue to have curtailments this year, which is also factored in. Australia year on year is not a big variance, it's flat to modestly down. Again, we operated a big portion of 2020 with the Train down at Gorgon. So that's not a big driver of the year-on-year change.\nPhil Gresh: My follow-up would just be on capital allocation. Balance sheet, obviously still looks very strong Pierre, you said your dividend coverage is below $50 Brent I think for a second straight quarter and that's despite downstream still being soft. So with oil here in the 50s, I think some people are maybe little surprised, you didn't increase your dividend the other day recognizing we're still in the midst of a pandemic, but just any thoughts you could share around capital allocation if oil does indeed stay here in the 50s?\nMike Wirth: Yes, well, a couple of things maybe in response to it, Phil. Thanks for recognizing we are still in the middle of a pandemic. Demand is still off, in total, the global economy is functioning at below its capacity and I think there is uncertainty out there. And certainly, oil prices today are supported in part by unilateral move by Saudi Arabia to take 1 million barrels a day off the market and so while we see inventories coming down and things trending back towards balance, that process is still underway, and so we want to be mindful of the uncertainties in the commodity price environment and there could be some downside risk. So all that said, maybe two other points, one, well, for the last three years, we announced a dividend increase in the first quarter, if you go further back over the last decade, it was never a first quarter increase. It actually was in other quarters. And so we don't necessarily have a pattern or a kind of a preference for when the dividend increase would occur, it's really based on our assessment of both short-term and long-term conditions, affordability et cetera. And it's a Board decision and the Board reviews that every quarter. So I hope our words have been more our actions over recent years have demonstrated to you and to our shareholders that the dividend is our number one priority. We have not changed that, others have, others have made moves and reshuffled priorities and reset dividends and all the rest, we have not. And we were guided through this by those financial priorities and we're very mindful of what our investors look for, why they hold our stock, and that's certainly something that will be part of our discussions as we go forward. Last comment to your hypothesis. If we stay in a $55 Brent world for all of this year, we're in a very strong position from a cash flow standpoint, our breakeven is in the 40s and so we'd be free cash flow positive and that certainly is supportive of a dividend increase.\nOperator: Next we'll move to Jeanine Wai at Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: And I'd also like to congratulate Wayne and thanks for putting up for - with all of us for so many years. Thanks. My first question is again on shareholder returns. Chevron's prior $19 billion to $22 billion medium-term CapEx range, I believe that was based on $60 Brent and it left room for about $5 billion a year of buybacks. So can you talk about how your updated 2022 to 2025 CapEx guidance - how, if we should think that range still also leaves room for ratable annual buybacks?\nMike Wirth: Well, it'd be a function Jeanine primarily commodity price, right. So we've outlined that budgeted premised on a lower price than $60 because we've been through this pandemic. And we expect only a gradual recovery in the global economy, which would support gradual recovery in commodity prices. So we've prepared ourselves for a difficult set of market conditions, which is certainly what we saw last year. If - and as I just mentioned to Phil, we can hold production flat to grow it at these capital levels and so we're in a position to consider dividend increases and share buybacks if we see an economic recovery and commodity price environment that supports that. The fundamental premise that we outlined at $60 continues to be our premise which is disciplined capital spending, a commitment to the dividend and a return of surplus capital above and beyond that to shareholders premised upon a strong balance sheet and the other things that we always talk about within our priorities. So we'll lay out a little more detail on this in March for you so that you can understand what this would look like under different price scenarios and how we might allocate capital, the flexibility we'd have for capital distributions under different price scenarios. So stay tuned for more discussion in March.\nJeanine Wai: We'll stay tuned for that. My second question is on the energy transition, I guess how does the current extremely low cost of capital for energy transition projects, energy transition companies, how does that impact your view on the speed of the transition and the potential to create lots of capacity that's potentially uneconomic, but nonetheless, it still erodes oil and gas demand. So I guess your views on that and how can Chevron compete in that type of environment? Thank you.\nMike Wirth: Yes. So certainly, this is a space that's getting a lot of love from investors right now and you see it in EV start-ups, you see it in solar start-ups, you see it in a lot of different technologies. And look, we're supportive of all of the above, we want to see advancements and growth in renewables. We expect a lower carbon energy system in the future. I think you put your finger on one things that needs to be watched is things that are supported by low interest rates, lots of investor enthusiasm and government policy may work in the short term. The question is when the tide starts flowing in other direction and when the day comes that interest rates are up, maybe investor perceptions shift a little bit and maybe government policy shifts a little bit, have we invested in things that can sustain in that environment? And I think that's - we hope that they can and we want to see the diversification of the energy mix to meet growing demand around the world and lower carbon. The last thing - I'm not sure that necessarily erodes energy demand as fast as some might believe or oil and gas demand as fast as some might believe, a lot of it is going into power that displaces coal, in some cases, creates capacity that is intermittent and can't be used all the time and actually requires natural gas to create grid stability and supply reliability, and so there is not necessarily a one for one displacements on all of these investments and that requires thoughtful study of the whole energy system to really understand how it's evolving and how this capacity plays against all the other different sources of energy.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, thanks for taking some time this morning and let me congratulate Wayne as well and I appreciate the time and friendship over the years. Let me kick it off here on downstream. When we think about our model, upstream did okay, downstream was a clear miss relative to our projections and it's not surprising just given how tough demand was in the fourth quarter, we are seeing cracks move in the right direction with line of sight to OPEC barrels coming back into the market, do you guys envision a downstream ahead and how do you think about your refining configuration to capture that?\nMike Wirth: Yes. So you're right. Downstream conditions have still been tough demand is off, it's off differentially across different parts of the product barrel, which continues to stress the refining system and then it's - the amount that is off varies quite a bit regionally, right. So in China, things are back to normal, by and large, other parts of Asia, pretty darn close. Europe, North America, not so much. So it's a gradually healing system, but it's different in different parts of the world and refining markets are regional and they are interconnected globally. But fundamentally they start out regionally. So we're looking for improvement over the course of this year. But I wouldn't call it a full recovery. I think it's, again it's a gradual process and we're certainly heavy on the West Coast and heavy in Asia and so in Asia things are, as I said, a little bit better. But on the West Coast, they are still recovering. So I think, downstream in 2021, I would expect to be better than it was in '20, but we're not anticipating pre-pandemic downstream earnings and performance of this year.\nPierre Breber: Neil, if I can just give a little more on the fourth quarter, I made a reference to this year-end inventory adjustment. I'll just explain that, it was more than $100 million, so during the course of the year you're costing inventory at average cost of the commodities. At year end, you see if you've built or drove relative to prior year layers, and so the good news is we drew, we took our inventory levels down, so good management of working capital, but we drew into prior year layers that were higher costed and so that's only something we do at year end in the fourth quarter. You don't - you're not doing it during the year, because you don't know if you're going to go into prior year layers in the intervening quarters. So you don't want to be always doing this calculation, but our practice is at year end, we revalue that, so you have - think of it as inventory that had been valued at $42 during the course of the year, when we go into prior year layers, we're picking it up at $60 or $70. There is no cash impact. But there is a one-time kind of P&L effect. We don't call it a special item because it happens every year. It just happened this year, but through good inventory management, we actually drew down in the prior year layers, which were higher costed.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks Pierre. That makes ton sense. My follow-up is, you guys acquired Noble towards the bonds of cycle. Mike, you've built a reputation as being a good deal maker and been willing to walk away when the bid-ask goes the wrong way. Do you still see it as a buyers' market out there, and do you still see attractive opportunities, whether it's U.S. E&P or elsewhere in the portfolio?\nMike Wirth: So it's still a tough market, and you would say that in general, I would say both companies and asset valuations are down from where they've historically been. So there is opportunity in circumstances like that and we've got the capacity to consider doing things. We may have passed the bottom; hopefully, we have from the standpoint of commodity and other cycles here. And we're alert to opportunities, it may be that as companies come back in terms of their equity valuation, there's still a lot of people that are carrying a fair amount of debt and have indicated a desire to sell assets in order to repair their own balance sheets. So we could see a market where there are more asset sellers than there are buyers which could offer some opportunities at an asset level and so we'll be aware and alert to those things. The nice thing is we're not in a position where we have to do anything. We strengthened ourselves significantly with a very good deal last year. We've got plenty of inventory to work on for many, many years to come. And anything we would do would have to, A, fit strategically into a strong portfolio, and B, it would have to compete for capital in a strong portfolio. And so we'll continue to hold the bar very high and only consider things that would really make a lot of sense.\nOperator: We'll go next to Paul Cheng at Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: First, I just want to say thank you to Wayne over the last three years for all the help and insights and wish you the best in your next role. Two questions, Mike or Pierre. One, I want to go back into the federal leases exposure. Can you share with us, in the Permian, over the 2019 and 2020, what percent of your activity is actually in the federal leases? I understand that federal leases will be only about 10%, 15% of your overall Permian land position, but want to see that on a 360 lens of how that looked like? And also that how many permit that you already in hand in Permian and whether you have all the lipid permits for your program in the Gulf of Mexico this year? Also, that if you can just give the production number in the fourth quarter in Permian DJ and Duvernay? The second question is on ESG and the carbon new product or service. We understand you are not interested in going into the renewable power like solar and wind. But is there any other new product or service related to ESG and carbon, do you think you have the technology that you can build it into a new business and not just as a concept, but as a new business? Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Hey Paul, its Pierre. I'll start with your first question. I think we'll take some of that offline with Wayne and the IR team in terms of production from the various basins. Our federal acreage, as you said, in the Permian is less than 10%, it went down a little bit due to Noble acquisition. We're not going to disclose the activity for the last year and how much was the mix, I think you can find, it's publicly available data and you can chase that down. In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, I think it's well known that permits tend - you don't - you have a lower inventory at permit. So if we have a bigger inventory permits in the Permian Basin, we and other operators do, that's not the case in the Gulf of Mexico. So those permits tend to be a lower inventory. I will just point out that we have one floating rig on a long-term contract in the Gulf of Mexico that expires at the end of the year. So we'll again take your other detailed questions offline. And then Mike, do you want to answer the energy transition?\nMike Wirth: Yes, I was thinking about the first questions and so energy transition as I caught it, Paul, what technologies are we interested in? I think we've indicated carbon capture and storage for sure, we recently made an investment in other carbon storage technology startup and you can expect to continue to hear more from us on that front. And then of course hydrogen should be in our wheelhouse. We manufacture hydrogen today, we've sold hydrogen before at retail and we should have the toolkit to take what is technically feasible today, but not economically practical and look for ways to drive costs down and scale up hydrogen over time. And so I can't promise you we're going to get that to a point where it's fully competitive with the alternatives today, but that's an area that few companies have the capability to do all the things required and we're one of the types of companies that should be able to work on that. So those would be two areas you can expect to see us active in.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Terreson at Evercore ISI.\nDoug Terreson: Mike, Chevron's equity has handily outperformed the S&P Energy since you became CEO a few years ago whether it's focus or decisiveness, I think as you'd like to call it, on higher returns on capital and lower debt and lower dividend breakevens have been a winning formula with energy investors. Simultaneously, the pace of change in the industry seems to be quickening not only as it relates to policy, which you talked about a minute ago and likely future energy mix, but also that which is expected from investments within the sector. So my question is a couple-fold. Number one, how do you guys think about how to navigate this evolving environment, which is somewhat different? Two, more tactical and strategic dexterity likely to be needed maybe more than in the past. And then finally what might be the implications for financial strategy in this new environment or is it too early to know?\nMike Wirth: Yes, well, hey, Doug, first of all, I want to congratulate you, reason being throwing bouquets to Wayne. I know this is the last lap around the track for you this year as well. So, congratulations and best wishes in the future.\nDoug Terreson: Thanks.\nMike Wirth: On your question, I think a lot of the fundamentals that we've been exhibiting in our strategy will continue to serve shareholders well as we go forward, the capital and cost discipline, it is the ability to meet the needs of today's markets while investing for tomorrow's markets and with the diversified portfolio we have across business lines and across geographies, we can mitigate market and regulatory risk that may emerge in one country because we've got a footprint that allows us to shift resources and capital allocation to other parts of our portfolio. So, for 140-plus years, this is what we've been doing. You're right, things are evolving now, but they've been evolving for quite some time and I think the capabilities we have in our organization, the honest dialog we try to have with everybody about how do you meet the growing demand for energy and the desire to see the mix change and how do we continue to invest where we have advantages in both the existing core business and the emerging new businesses is what you will see us continue to do. At the core, I think the financial priorities stay the same. We are committed to the dividend, we're committed to organic reinvestment in order to support that dividend and that can be a reinvestment across the entire spectrum of energy technologies, maintaining a strong balance sheet, we've seen this last year how important that is. And then we've got surplus cash after those first three needs to distribute that back to shareholders. That framework is intact and I don't see that changing.\nDoug Terreson: And also good luck to Wayne for me as well, he has done as done a great job in this role. Thanks a lot.\nMike Wirth: Thanks Doug. Are there any other questions?\nOperator: We'll move next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Please go ahead.\nBiraj Borkhataria: I had a couple. So the first one is just around your comments around generating free cash flow, prevailing commodity prices. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the balance sheet and where you'd be comfortable in terms of gearing, as you move through 2021? Also, Pierre, maybe you can touch on the recent announcement from the S&P on potential changes in credit ratings in the sector and risk of the industry with the transition and how that is working into your thinking in managing the balance sheet? And then the second question on a different topic with Gorgon down in the quarter presuming that's obviously a decent hit to your LNG portfolio. Can you confirm if you were buying spot LNG cargoes in the fourth quarter, and then just if you can give a rough sense of the quantity or the earnings impact on that because I guess that's more transitory in nature given some of the issues there. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: All right. Thanks, Biraj. It's Pierre. I'll start. Mike just went through our financial priorities and we're in a good place on a debt ratio. Our net debt ratio is under 23%, that includes the assumption of debt from the Noble acquisition which added about $9 billion of debt. So I've talked about, we don't have a target net debt ratio range but I've talked about a range between 20% and 25% is a good place to be over the cycle, we can be below that at times, we'd be heading up towards this range, if we're above it for some reason, I'd want to have confidence that we're heading down that range. So it's not a hard and fast target. But we're in a really good place with a leading balance sheet, low breakeven, as Mike talked about, and very well positioned. We also have asset sales that we provided some guidance on here on the call. In terms of the S&P, look, we work with them, it was an industry-wide call. I think our track record speaks for itself in terms of being disciplined with capital, protecting the balance sheet and being very progressive about the future of energy and our approach of higher returns, lower carbon. So I think that lines up with the rating agencies. But that's not something we control, that will be up to them, we're managing the company for long-term value, and we think we're doing a good job.\nMike Wirth: Biraj, on your question on Australian LNG, simple way to think about this is we've got 80% or so of our volume termed up and you can think about having a train down for a better part of this last quarter. So, four out of five trains running, so about 80% of our capacity. So we've been able to satisfy all of our term needs and we're in the market now with our commercial organization buying a cargo here and some of the cargo there, and then on the spot market, but we haven't been out of position and hurt because we had to buy high and sell low to any meaningful degree through this whole cycle.\nOperator: We'll move next to Doug Leggate at Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Wayne, I want to wish you good luck and hoping Roderick gets to the level you are thinking here. Congratulations. Guys. I wonder if I could just go back to the capital allocation question very quickly. Mike, you've now got Israel on a lot of growth opportunities that Noble had talked about longer term and it sounds like you're barging away a little bit from the need for growth in the Permian. I'm just wondering if under Biden administration, is that how we should think about capital allocation international versus domestic now you've got bigger opportunity set?\nMike Wirth: We'll have to see how things play out in the U.S. I don't want to overreact to that at this point in time until we know more. But fundamentally, we intend to continue to be very disciplined in the allocation of capital. Noble's assets in Israel have the big part of their capital spend behind them. Right now, there is capacity to grow production there with little or no incremental capital right now and the nice thing is we bring some capabilities to bear here that might not have been in Noble's wheelhouse. So there is ways to take this gas further into regional markets. There's ways to take it into LNG, be it facilities that have all LNG today, they should go into our - Noble had been looking at an FLNG concept, there are ways to take it to power markets and in the power generation and then regional power distribution across borders and there are opportunities to look at things like hydrogen and new energy technologies as well. So we have the financial strength and capacity to underwrite things larger than perhaps Noble could have and some technical capability and relationship depth in some of these markets, that should be an advantage. And so will look to use those to support the growth of the position in Israel. And then the broad allocation question U.S. versus other countries. We're always thinking about that and always looking at that and drawn by returns and risk and we'll continue to evaluate those things.\nDoug Leggate: My follow-up is maybe for Pierre, a follow-up to the S&P question earlier. Not clear or unsure whether you guys want to answer this, but it's really more about the external pressures that you're seeing whether it be from one of your large peers seeing an active shareholder, we're talking about big energy European investment community and obviously your European peers moving in that direction and now you've got the credit agencies and it seems to me at least that the U.S. side of the pond, you're still very much in the big oil category in terms of how you see your opportunity set going forward. I'm just curious, Mike or Pierre, how do you see these external pressures influencing discussions with the Board, discussions with investors and ultimately the longer term energy mix, when we see Chevron move towards up big energy story over time?\nMike Wirth: Well, I'm going to come back, I think Pierre mentioned earlier that we describe our strategy with four simple words, it's higher returns and lower carbon and both of those things matter to the investors that we speak to. and we're working hard on both fronts, and we've got to improve return on capital and demonstrate that we're going to do that and at the same time. We also have to prepare for a lower carbon energy system in the future and we're reducing the intensity of the energy we deliver today and making really good progress on that and we'll continue to set new targets in that area because the world stepping on the hose of supply through one way or another doesn't really change demand. And so, somehow demand will need to be met and we think it should be met by those that can do it in a way that has the lowest carbon impact. We're increasing the production of renewable and lower carbon products for our customers so they can reduce their energy intensity and carbon intensity and then likewise, looking at these breakthrough technologies and I mentioned a couple of them earlier. So every company in the industry, Doug, is searching for the right mix. There is not an empirically observable a correct answer to this and I think we're all working with our various stakeholders, right, our boards, our employees, our customers of the countries where we operate, and that's a policy that we operate under to manage both of these things and look energy is the lifeblood of the global economy and reliable affordable energy will be fundamental to the recovery from the pandemic, in the short term and in the longer term, it will be fundamental to lifting people out of poverty around the world and we have to remember that. And today's energy system is not the enemy. Lower emissions are what we should be focused on and that's what we as a company are focused on and that's what we talk to our stakeholders about and that's what we're committed to doing.\nOperator: We'll go next to Paul Sankey at Sankey Research.\nPaul Sankey: Hello Mike, a strategy question. You've obviously addressed your strategy on the call, but I just wondered in the light of activism that we're seeing, what - are there any specific requests if you like, or strategy pushes that you're getting from shareholders? I wondered if you could just update us on what you've been hearing and perhaps whether you're sympathetic to the ideas that are being pushed towards you, and maybe whether you're pushing back? And then I had a follow-up just on the decline rates. You said that you got higher decline rates on lower spending in '21. Having said that, the number is only 70,000 barrels a day or about a 2% decline. Can you just help me understand why that number is so low? Thank you.\nMike Wirth: Yes, Paul. So on strategy push from shareholders, it's not a lot that's being said and shareholder discussions, they haven't discussed here. It's - what is your strategy for a lower carbon world and yourself having unique strengths and if there's one thing I do hear back from people, it is support for not going into things where we wouldn't have competitive differentiation and we may pursue lower return investments just for the sake of saying, we're doing it when there's others out there that can do it just as well. So beyond that, I'm not hearing a lot of strategy push from shareholders. I'll let Pierre take the question on declines.\nPierre Breber: Yes. And just add to Mike's comments, I mean this is a sector that is trying to regain favor with investors and it hasn't earned its cost of capital and the way out of that isn't by investing more capital. So being disciplined in our conventional business with capital being disciplined in M&A and being disciplined with the energy transition as Jeanine asked, renewable energy products operate in commodity markets that have cycles up and down just like conventional products do. In terms of our decline, yeah, Paul, I'm not sure what I meant to say is that you will see declines this year resulting from our capital last year because we did take capital down, but as you rightly point out the decline and we tried to put that on the best apples-to-apples basis. So again, we've got curtailment adjusted and then asset sales or contract expirations adjusted, which is a good view of our base and our shale and tight. And so it's a little more than a 2% decline. It is a big change because that would have been growth previously because you would have had Permian growing, that's how that was part of the reallocation. Mike showed a chart that said we are likely to invest $40 billion over the last year and this year. But $13 billion of it was Noble. So no doubt our organic portfolio is not growing like it would have been previously because we've taken some capital out. But as you point out, it's a modest decline, it's because we're facility constrained in a lot of places. We have long-lived assets like in Australia LNG and Tengiz and offshore, and even the declines in what's considered high decline areas like the Permian, we're able to mitigate. Mike said earlier that our Permian production is beating our guidance range and will actually be up because of the Noble barrels that we added 2021 versus 2020 full year and if you adjust for curtailments. So it's a good story that we're able to be so efficient and mitigate declines and I'm happy picked up on that number.\nOperator: And we will move next to Dan Boyd of Mizuho Securities.\nDan Boyd: Hi, thanks for squeezing me on what I would just say thanks for sticking to your guns and only doing things where you have a competitive advantage. Clear business sense. I - most things have been asked, so I just have one for, Pierre, just on the FX, which has been a headwind to earnings this year. Can you talk about the cash impact that that has if any and how you see that potentially playing out in 2021?\nPierre Breber: Yes, the vast majority of it is non-cash, I mean it's balance sheet translation. So it's taking your monetary accounts, asset accounts and liability accounts and revaluing it. What we've seen is during the course of the year the dollar strengthened initially and then we saw it weakening relative to other currencies in particularly like in Australia, Canada, some of the others where we'll have like a deferred tax liability that gets revalued. So it turns into cash over time, but it depends on what the exchange rate is at that time in the future. So you have modest amounts that happened in the quarter, but the vast majority is reflecting a full revaluation of that liability - monetary liability or monetary asset account and what - how it ultimately settles will decide if those gains or losses are realized or not in cash flow.\nOperator: We'll go next to Manav Gupta at Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: I just wanted to ask one question, you are absolutely leading the charge on RNG and some of the projects that you are actually developing even RNG have a CI of like minus 150 to minus 200, that's significantly lower than any EV can actually produce at this point of time. Yet, all we see out there is the demand for EVs and states saying they only want to run on EVs and car manufacturers saying they only want to make EVs. So is there something that Chevron and the industry groups can do to educate the governments or the markets that there are other forms of lower carbon like RNG which actually have a much significantly lower carbon intensity than an actual EV?\nMike Wirth: Manav, I'm impressed, you've done your homework on carbon intensity and not many have to your-- the foundation of your question. Look, RNG is very good from a carbon standpoint because if you mitigate otherwise unmitigated methane emissions and that's why it gets the very attractive CI factor. CI factor has to be worth something and maybe because RNG from a first-cost basis is more expensive than fossil natural gas. And so in markets where there is a policy framework that creates that financial connection to the low CI, it's attractive and economic and that's where we're playing today, I would expect over time that those policy frameworks could expand for the reasons that underlying your question. And we are working with customers as well to help incentivize the adoption of CNG vehicles. We've got an initiative in California where we will subsidize truck owners to convert or buy new heavy-duty CNG engines in return for a supply agreement and then we're working with a number of different distribution points to enable that to happen. So we think that's a good part of the mix. It's not the answer everywhere, but it is certainly a part of the mix that we think deserves to grow and that's why we've been investing into it and it ties to the earlier comments about doing things where we've got unique and competitive advantages.\nOperator: We'll move next to Jon Rigby at UBS.\nJon Rigby: Thanks for taking my question. Two questions actually. One is on, when you think about the portfolio and also what you've seen in the market through the sort of '15 - '14, '15 volatility, the volatility you see now. Are you starting to change the way you look at the investments that you're making going forward, so you are looking at hurdle rates, payback periods et cetera and changing them to sort of tailor a different environment going forward? And also I mean if you are, are you able to do that through the portfolio? Can you also do that through the way you approach the development of an asset, so you build it with the expectation of adding satellites longer term or you build the bigger host et cetera? First question. The second which is slightly tied to that and it seems to me also you demonstrated that low gearing, a low level of debt indebtedness has served you very well through those two cycles. So when you think about the sort of three shock absorbers that you have, so short cycle investments, balance sheet and buybacks, is in the near term the priority getting debt down? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: All right. Thanks, Jon. Look, I'll get started. I think the answer to your first question is yes and no. No, we're not changing how we look at investments, we don't want to go to ancient history books to know that the top line in our business is volatile. We've had - not just '14, '15, you go '08-'09, you go late '90s and so to have companies in our industry that don't have balance sheets that are built for something that we know occurs with some frequency is capital structure that doesn't make a lot of sense, it transfers too much risk to equity holders and that's partly reflected why the energy sector has underperformed other sectors for a while. So in that sense, I don't think we think a bit differently, but to the second part of your first question, can we do developments differently? Absolutely. Can we size them to keep them full longer offshore? I mean, I think Mike has talked about the capital efficiency of our shale and tight, the flexibility of it. So undoubtedly our capital efficiency is better than it ever has been, I mean it's our ability to generate positive free cash flow from a dollar of capital invested. We've talked about being very disciplined with our capital which reinforces it, but the basic premise of operating in a set of commodity businesses that are volatile, that hasn't changed in the last several years, that's been the case for the 30 years I've been with the company. And as you said, I think to your second part of the question, how we operate with our four financial priorities is it reflects that reality and so we understand what business we're in. And then how - what kind of capital structure we should have that's in the interest of our shareholders.\nJon Rigby: Right. So - but to that point is even with an advantage balance sheet that you have against your peers, I think that's what they acknowledge, would it be fair to say that the first priority those of the three variable things excepting the dividend is a structural thing is probably balance sheet?\nPierre Breber: Well, again, our four priorities, Mike went through and it's dividend, reinvestment because we got to generate cash for the dividend, maintaining a strong balance sheet and buybacks is fourth and so we're always going to maintain a strong balance sheet, I gave a kind of a range that we think is a good place to be over the cycle, and again we can be below it, heading towards it or above it. So the balance sheet is, well. It's right in the middle of the range I've been talking about since I've been CFO. So there is no primary need on balance sheet. I mean what's more, the bigger driver is, we're not at a full economic recovery here and so getting control the pandemic, getting the world economies growing again on a sustained path, that will be good for our business. Our breakeven is under $50, you can do the math, if oil prices are above $50 and if downstream margins improve because that's a breakeven under $50 including pretty weak downstream margins, we'll have excess cash and we'll look at our priorities and make decisions like we have in the past. Just as a reminder, we bought back shares 13 of last 17 years. We bought back shares on average during that time period basically equivalent to the daily average. So we're pretty consistent returner of cash to shareholders in the form of sustained and growing dividends and share buybacks when we had excess cash.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Ryan Todd at Simmons Energy.\nRyan Todd: I'll just - maybe a couple of quick ones at the end. On disposals moving forward and with the downsized capital program, should we expect a relatively downsized disposal program on a run rate basis? And if so, is there a range in terms of what we should think of in terms of annual disposals? And then maybe as a follow-up question. As we think about your 2021 production guidance, the contract expirations in Indonesia and Thailand, can you confirm what the volume impact is there and any willingness to share what the potential cash flow impact of those volumes would be at $50 oil?\nMike Wirth: Okay, I'll take the asset sale question and let Pierre handle contracts. Ryan, first thing is, we don't need to conduct asset sales to generate cash, other companies might be in a different position. But, look, we've closed out the program we announced previously, we're not announcing a new program. Pierre guided to $2 billion to $3 billion for '21 and if you look back over the last two decades, we've been kind of plus or minus a couple of billion dollars a year in normal portfolio maintenance and kind of rotation. And so I think that's the kind of a number you want to think about for your model. And like I said this coming year we might be a little bit to the upside of that, there'll be some years we'd be below that. But we're doing this to high grade and strengthen our portfolio. Not to generate cash. Pierre, I'll let you take the contracts question.\nPierre Breber: Yes, Ryan, I mean we disclosed in our supplement tables that we provide each quarter production by country. You see it in our 10-K. So I think it's pretty transparent what production in Indonesia and Thailand is. Not all of Thailand is part of the concessions that are expiring here early next year. We don't disclose cash flow by country. I mean, there's a fair amount of disclosure in our oil and gas tables that you can look back for there. So we'll continue to provide what we think is meaningful guidance each quarter as we go forward. We showed the variance that was tied to contract expirations. So I think all the pieces of the puzzle are there for you. And of course, if you have follow-up questions, please reach out to Wayne and Roderick.\nWayne Borduin: Well, I'd like to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Audra, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-10-30 17:52:02", "content": "Operator: Good morning, my name is Audra and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead, sir.\nWayne Borduin: Thank you, Audra. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations and on the call with me today are Mark Nelson, EVP of Downstream and Chemicals; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I'll turn it over to Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Wayne. Third-quarter earnings were about breakeven, improved from last quarter, but reflecting continued challenging market conditions. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Special items totaled $220 million, including a tax charge related to a settlement agreement on asset retirement funding and other items tied to the expiration next August of the Rokan production sharing contract in Indonesia. Free cash flow was almost $2 billion, and the dividend was flat with last quarter. Turning to Slide 4. Cash flow from operations improved as commodity prices increased from their lows in the second quarter. Included this quarter was a $265 million cash payment related to the Rokan settlement agreement. Our cash flow dividend breakeven was under $50 Brent due to improved downstream performance and our strong capital and operating cost management. We ended the quarter with a net debt ratio over 17%, well below our competitors. Even after closing the Noble acquisition and stepping up its debt to fair value, we expect to maintain the leading balance sheet among the peer group. We're committed to protecting our financial strength during this ongoing crisis. Turning to the next slide, our 2020 capital spending is trending below our latest guidance. Looking ahead, we expect next year's capital budget to be $14 billion below the combined 2020 guidance from Chevron and Noble, and well below Chevron's five-year guidance from our March Investor Day. Our 2021 capital budget will continue to prioritize investments that drive long-term value and shows the capital flexibility in our portfolio, including assets recently added from Noble. We'll share additional details in December after formal approval. Operating expenditures in the quarter were more than 10% lower than our 2019 quarterly average ahead of our guidance. Turning to Slide 6, relative to the same period last year, third quarter adjusted upstream earnings decreased due to lower realizations and reduced liftings, primarily due to curtailments, partially offset by lower depreciation and operating expenses. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes and margins. The other segment was higher, primarily due to various corporate charges. Turning to Slide 7, compared to the second quarter, third quarter earnings increased by about $8 billion, more than half due to the absence of second quarter special items. Adjusted upstream earnings were up almost $2 billion, primarily due to higher liquids realizations. Adjusted downstream earnings increased by over $1 billion, primarily due to higher sales volumes and margins and favorable swings in both timing effects and lower cost to market inventory adjustments at CPChem. The other segment charges decreased primarily due to a favorable swing in accruals for stock-based compensation. Turning to production, third quarter oil equivalent production excluding asset sales was 3% lower than a year ago. During the past 12 months, we closed a number of asset sales all signed pre-pandemic. Increased Permian production and higher entitlement effects were offset primarily by curtailments and higher turnarounds. The curtailments were in line with our guidance range and reflect mostly OPEC plus reductions in Kazakhstan and Africa and market-driven constraints in Thailand. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark.\nMark Nelson: Thanks, Pierre. As shown on Slide 9, the operating environment has improved from the lows in the second quarter, but it's still challenged. Some products like diesel and petrochemicals have been more resilient during the pandemic, and we've been able to develop new customer channels. Conversely, jet demand has only modestly recovered. The jet demand picture has resulted in weak product margins well below cyclical averages. Since the crisis started, we've been focused on what we can control; safe and reliable operations, cost management, and value chain optimization. In the third quarter, our financial results improved due to strong performance in these areas along with some margin improvement in polyethylene and West Coast fuels. Turning to the next slide. Our focus on cost management is delivering results. The third quarter operating expenses are nearly 20% lower than pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter. I'm proud of how our employees have risen to this challenge. Streamlining work processes, reducing contractor costs, and adapting activity levels to a lower-margin environment. Our teams have also delivered on more than 90% of the planned scope of our 2020 turnaround program, deferring only a minor amount of activity. This is a tremendous accomplishment and positions our refinery network to be ready without a backlog when the economy is back to pre-pandemic levels. Optimization activities further reduce the cost of this year's planned work, contributing to lower operating expenses. Turning to the next slide. As always, we're focused on safe and reliable operations keeping our employees safe, being a good neighbor, and delivering the products that the world needs are all part of our license to operate. Since the economic slowdown began, we\u2019ve balanced efficient refinery utilization with the highest margin sales channels for our products. We\u2019ve consistently placed more than 90% of our high-value products into our contracted sales channels despite volatility in demand. This generates the best margins across our value chains. The recent acquisitions of marketing assets in Australia in the Pasadena Refinery in the US Gulf Coast further extends our value chains in those regions, giving us more opportunities to improve profitability and returns. Turning to chemicals, GS Caltex continues to make good progress on their new mixed feed cracker. We expect the project to be under budget and months ahead of schedule. Our local team has done a remarkable job safely progressing the project despite the challenges of COVID-19. At CPChem, we've completed feed at our US Gulf Coast cracker II project and have placed it on hold as we assess market conditions. We continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals of chemicals and the importance of world-scale facilities with access to low cost feedstock. At the same time, any new investment needs to be supported by project economics that will generate strong returns through the price cycle. Also, CPChem began producing circular polyethylene at scale, an industry first in the United States. The production of PE from plastic waste is an important milestone, and it underscores our commitment to finding innovative ways to deliver sustainable products to our customers. Now turning to renewable fuels. The future of energy is lower carbon, and we're delivering more alternative products to our customers. Recently, we announced first gas at our CalBio renewable natural gas joint venture in California and a new partnership with Brightmark. Our capital committed to RNG ventures is over $200 million. In renewable diesel, we are leveraging existing infrastructure to co-process biofeed at our El Segundo Refinery, with startup is expected in the first half of next year. Also, we sell a range of branded biodiesels and are piloting the sale of R99 in Southern California. Through Novvi, we recently announced the first production of renewable base oil at our 500 barrel a day plant in Texas. This leading technology partnership is developing, innovative and sustainable products with future expansion potential. And lastly, our GS Caltex hydrogen testing site in South Korea has opened. The first of its kind in Seoul where customers convergence traditional fuels as well as hydrogen and electricity. All of these efforts align with how we're increasing renewables in support of our business. Part of our approach to the energy transition which Pierre will now further discuss.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Mark. We continue to make good progress in our energy transition focus areas. Next year we expect to find $100 million of projects identified with our Marginal Abatement Cost Curve. The MACC tool helps to select the most cost efficient projects to reduce carbon intensity across our operations. As Mark noted, we announced a new joint venture with Brightmark, extending our renewable natural gas portfolio. Finally, in our partnership with Svante, we're pleased to have been awarded a US DOE grant to help fund the construction of a demonstration carbon capture plant in our California upstream operations. The project is expected to start up in 2022. These projects reflect Chevron's commitment to low carbon solutions that are both good for the environment and good for our shareholders. Turning to the next slide, we closed the Noble Energy acquisition earlier this month, and integration is on track. We've completed employee selections at some early quick wins like paying off the revolver and selling its plane and assessment of operational opportunities is well on its way. In the third quarter, Noble generated positive free cash flow primarily due to ongoing capital and cost management and strong sales in the Eastern Med. We're pleased to add Noble assets and welcome it's talented employees to Chevron. Our internal transformation launched late last year is mostly complete with the new organization in place November, 1st. This was an enterprise-wide change effort, the largest since our Texaco merger that modernizes how we work, leveraging digital tools and empowered teams. Lastly, we recently signed an agreement to sell our Appalachia natural gas business. We expect to close the transaction before the end of the year. Now looking forward, in the fourth quarter, we expect Noble production to be lower, primarily due to seasonal demands in the Eastern Med. Curtailments and planned downtime are both lower than last quarter. Production this quarter may include additional cost recovery barrels related to the RioCan settlement. At Gorgon Train 2 well repairs are now complete and we have started commissioning in preparation for LNG production. We expect Train 1 to be taken out of service after Train 2 is back online. At TCO, remobilization continues. We successfully increased the project workforce to near 15,000 and our plans are to end the year with the project team over 20,000. Earlier this week, we completed our final sealift on schedule. All modules are now in Kazakhstan, a significant project milestone. And finally we expect severance payments to lower cash flow. With that, I'll turn it over to Wayne.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue. So please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Audra, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning. I have one upstream question here and one downstream question. Maybe, Mark sort of a downstream question, which is it looked like that the downstream results and particularly refining, surprised relative to our expectations. Was there anything that you would call out here in the third quarter as many of the independent refiners had very tough third quarters including on the West Coast, and just can you then step back and talk about your big picture outlook for the refining sector in that part of your business?\nMark Nelson: Thanks for the question, Neil. First, if I step back and look operationally at the third quarter performance overall, I would say that operationally it was first driven by our continued cost management efforts across the downstream chemicals portfolio, much of which is actually focused in our manufacturing sector, also some polyethylene in West Coast fuels margin improvement and then contribution from our lubricants and additives business. Yes, if I step back and look at the refining sector in general, I would say that the pre-pandemic demand shock clearly has retested margin lows. There is not a real analog for the pace of recovery, but the three things are required, I think to have sustainable improved refining margins. First, demand recovery for all high-value products in our materials, we certainly indicated that as an industry we're within 5% to 10% of 2019 motor [ph] gasoline, diesel levels, but the jet is still only half of 2019, and so we need continued recovery there. Second, we need inventory reduction, and we're beginning to see some of that in different parts of the world. And finally, refinery rationalization, and this is the part that's interesting for us because we've rationalized our portfolio over the past decade and we're now seeing competitors start to do that. In some of the regions of the world like Southeast Asia, Australia, and the US Coast, you're hearing people talk about rationalization, which certainly creates an opportunity for us going forward as the supply and demand balance tightens a bit over time. Thanks for the question, Neil.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks. Thanks, Mark. And then, Pierre a follow-up for you, it's on Gorgon. Where do we stand with Train 2, and what do we know about Train 1 and Train 3 in terms of managing the downtime there?\nPierre Breber: Yes. Thanks, Neil. As I said the well repairs are complete. We verified them with non-destructive testing. We've also completed pressure testing of the kettle. So, we're now in the process of getting back online. So, we've started the recommissioning process from the turnaround and the extended turnaround. The next steps are to dry out the systems and then we'll begin cool down. We expect this to take several weeks, which will put first LNG production in the second half of November. In terms of Train 1, as I said, we expect that to be taken down soon after Train 2 is back online. And then we would inspect Train 1 and depending on whether repairs are required or not that will determine how long Train 1 is down, and then sequentially then we would look to Train 3 after that one.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: We'll move next to Jeanine Wai at Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Hi, good morning everyone, thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on...\nPierre Breber: Good morning, Jeanine.\nJeanine Wai: Good morning. My first question is on sustaining CapEx and the second one is on the upstream with Eastern Med. So the second half 2020 CapEx run rate that's below your multi-year sustaining upstream capital estimate of $10 billion. You've accomplished a lot this year with cost reductions and efficiency improvements. So, my first question is whether there is an update to that $10 billion in sustaining capital number that you provided a few quarters ago, and I know we've got Noble in the mix now too.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Jeanine. No, there isn't. I mean the $10 billion is really an estimate, right. It's based on our, again Chevron only, how to sustain production in the short term. Noble gave out an equivalent number around $800 million for that. To be clear, we're not trying to sustain short term production. Mark just talked about we're in an economy that's impacted by pandemic and demand for our products is below normal levels in pre-pandemic levels, and therefore we have oversupplied markets. We are trying to sustain the long-term value of the enterprise. So, if you look to our 2021 capital guidance of $14 billion, it includes an upstream capital of around 11 billion or so sort of higher than the sustaining level, but not all of it is going to short-term production. Some of it is going to long-term production like our project at Tengiz, so we're focused on sustaining long-term value, not short-term production. That's true in combination with Noble, but there is no real update to those numbers. Efficiency improvements are rolling through, but this is an estimate, an analytical estimate that's not so precise that we're going to be updating it frequently.\nJeanine Wai: Okay, great. Thank you. Understood. My second question is on the Eastern Med, could you provide any initial indications or thoughts on how you expect to monetize Leviathan and a lot of the other discovered resource in the area, I guess specifically, do you think that regional demand growth could be strong enough in the medium-term or longer-term to avoid either a greenfield LNG or a pipeline to Europe, and then I guess one more in there, if there is any commentary on the headlines on the pricing dynamics that would be helpful. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Hey, I won't comment on some of the headlines you've read, those are commercial matters that we'll discuss in private with our partners and with our customers. We've had a very smooth transition with our operations in Eastern Med and all across the Noble assets. Our integration is on track. Employee selections in the United States have already happened, we feel really good. We're pleased with the people who are joining us in the Eastern Med included, so Noble employees are top quality and we're very pleased to be welcoming them to Chevron. As you know, it's a good resource. At free cash flow positive, the project has been completed. It's in an area where there is demand opportunities and in particular backing out call, but it's only been a few weeks. So, our focus right now is to have a smooth integration with Noble, we're pleased again with the operations and the free cash flow generation. We're going to work with potential customers, existing customers, future customers to find the most cost-efficient way to develop that resource. There is upside to it and again there is market, but we will determine that all-in time.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Jeanine.\nOperator: We'll move next to Phil Gresh at JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh: Yes, hi, good morning. First question here. If I look at the third quarter, it looks like your Brent based breakeven price is somewhere in the order of $50 a barrel. And if you're talking about this restructuring plan that's been underway and kind of completing here, so I was just curious how you think about the cost side of the equation and the ability to further lower the operating costs and the breakeven moving forward, given that you've given us the capital number here already.\nPierre Breber: Yes, the breakeven and again, we would have it a little bit below $50. It's important that it doesn't factor in downstream margins or chemical margins and other parts of our business, which Mark has addressed and those can vary, and they can make a difference obviously on where the breakeven is, I mean margins in that sector are pretty low and as they recover that lowers our breakeven because again it's holding, it's just looking at the oil price and not all the other assumptions. In terms of cost, look our costs were down more than 10%. This quarter, we provided guidance that we expect to end the year on a Chevron-only basis here because fourth quarter will have Noble operating expenses. But if you just looked at Chevron only, we will be down a $1 billion, again we've characterized that as activity related and other actions that we've taken to manage through the pandemic and the crisis that we're in. We've also provided guidance and we've completed our transformation. So we launched that transformation, which is an enterprise-wide restructuring, we started that almost 12 months ago and we just are completing our employee selections right now, it's a tough time for our employees, as they are being notified and will have the new organization in place, November 1. We've talked about $1 billion of OpEx reductions from the transformation. And then finally, we have the Noble synergies and we've talked about $300 million of total Noble synergies, not all of that is operating expense. So all of that is rolling through, we will bring that together for you likely at our Investor Day on any kind of updated guidance, but it's all consistent with your question, which is we're working hard to get our breakeven down. We've sustained our dividend, so the comparisons are consistent and we continue to make progress, both through capital discipline, and cost management to lower our breakeven preserve. Our balance sheet strength right ending the quarter with the leading balance sheet in the industry, and net debt ratio of 17%. That's essentially what we're doing and we'll continue to do it as we're in these challenging times.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, great. Thank you. My second question would be, just as it relates to 2021 production. Obviously, you gave us a CapEx number here, on the last call you talked about the Permian potentially declining high single-digit rate year-over-year in '21 on an organic basis, obviously, you're layering in Noble here, so I didn't know if maybe you could provide any early read on '21 production, whether it's standalone or pro forma or if not a hard number, maybe some moving pieces around it.\nPierre Breber: Yes, we'll provide our production guidance as we normally do. That will be on our fourth quarter call at the end of January. We did provide guidance for the fourth quarter. So we do a quarter ahead. I think you've hit some of the pieces there. Again, I would add the Rokan PSC exploration, which I referred to and we had a settlement agreement, which is a really good agreement that ensures the uncertainty around the funding for abandonment and adds a little drilling activity to keep production managed heading into that contract expiration, but that's going to be in August of 2021, so I'll point that out. And again our efforts at Permian, which Jay talked about is a potential decline of 6% to 7% if we stay at those activity level. So I don't really have more to say Phil to you. We'll provide that guidance when we finalize our plans, get formal approval of our capital budget and we'll do it at our regular time during the fourth quarter earnings call.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, thank you.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: Next, we'll move to Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nWayne Borduin: Hi, Devin.\nDevin McDermott: Hey. So the first one I wanted to ask on is actually around some of the latest investments and momentum you made on emissions reductions and there's been some positive announcements here over the last few months and I think the disclosure on this marginal abatement cost curve is interesting and that it shows there is opportunities to potentially reduce emissions while also boosting returns of the negative plan cost of carbon that you have there. The question specifically as we think about over the next few years here, any sense of the depth of opportunities where you can actually have this nice win-win of driving down cost, while also reducing carbon intensity. And then as you think about planning longer-term, any intention of expanding your emission production goals that already exist perhaps post-2023 in the Paris Climate like some of your peers have done and just how you're thinking about that longer-term?\nPierre Breber: Sure. On the second question, as you said, we have four carbon intensity reduction metrics, they go out to 2023, 2023 was chosen because that's the first stocktake date under the Paris agreement and so we're aligned with those. We are the only company, first company, only company in our sector to do it on an equity basis, many do on an operatorship basis and then we do oil and gas metrics separately because they serve a different market. So the $100 million that you're referring to is, it's something that we expect will be recurring. So we see opportunities for a number of years to be able to invest that kind of expenditure and achieve what we'll call cost-efficient carbon reductions. But if I because -- and yes, will we extend at some point in time, I think, yes, the answer is yes, it would be logical for us to go to the next Paris stocktake date, but we're right now focused on delivering on those 2023 targets. We also have those as part of the incentive pay almost all every Chevron employee. So we're making good progress on that. But I would think, all of our energy transition activities, and Mark referred to a number in his business. They really support making our business more sustainable in a lower carbon future and they do it in a way where we earn return. So the renewable natural gas that Mark was talking about also generates returns. And then of course then we're looking at some of the new technologies and those obviously are at a different stage of maturity. So we're taking a number of actions that we believe address climate change, that lowers carbon and does it in a way that's good for the environment and good for our shareholders.\nDevin McDermott: Right, that makes a lot of sense. And then my second question is on the portfolio composition, post the Noble transaction. So you recently executed on the Appalachia sale, you're doing a good job under the kind of pruning the portfolio in investing the non-core assets over time. As we look forward here post this transaction, any updated thoughts on further opportunities for the best features and whether or not space as part of the question if you could address things like Noble Midstream or anything within our portfolio that might be non-core. And then lastly, whether not as part of the Noble transaction guaranteeing Noble's outstanding debt is part of what your vision.\nPierre Breber: Okay, Devin, I got the asset sales, what was the question about Noble debt at the end?\nDevin McDermott: Whether or not that will be guaranteed by Chevron?\nPierre Breber: All right, thanks. Well, let me just address Noble -- Noble debt. We're reviewing options, we haven't made a decision and again will notify bondholders when we make that decision and you should expect that in the next couple of months. In terms of asset sales, we are on track to complete the program that we talked about it was 2018 to 2020, a three year program of $5 billion to $10 billion and before tax proceeds. We expect to close our US natural gas sale here before year-end and when we complete that will be right in the middle of that range. In terms of what else is in the public domain, the most significant ownership interest that we've talked about is selling our interest in North West Shelf and that's the commercial matter and we just -- we won't comment on, but I guess I would just say, we're in a different place than many of our competitors, right. Mark referred to the rationalization we've done on our refining network over the last decade and even before, I referred to the number of asset sales that we've completed in the last 12 months. You saw that in our production chart, all of that where signed pre-pandemic at good values. Obviously, we just bought a bunch of a, sorry, a company that comes with high-quality assets and I won't comment on any specific assets in the Noble portfolio. So we are very value-driven. The gas assets that we have that we're planning to close here before the year-end and our interest in North West Shelf held up better in this post-pandemic world. Also, if you think of North West Shelf, it's more almost like an infrastructure investment as the resource behind the plant comes down and it becomes more of a tolling facility going forward. So you'll continue to see us to be disciplined in how we manage our portfolio. I would not expect us to have any kind of big program announcement, we'll have the ongoing portfolio rationalization that's been part of the Chevron approach to management for a long time.\nDevin McDermott: Thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning.\nPierre Breber: Hi, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Yes, thank you. Two questions, I think one is for Mark and one is for Pierre. Pierre, what would be a reasonable allocation of future capital in the Neil, we know about low carbon initiative and two, let's assume that at some point, you probably will set up a target to be net carbon zero on at least one [ph] scoop one or two, maybe over the next 15 years, 20 years. Do you need other new businesses like some of your peers go into, the renewable power business in order to achieve that? So that's the first question. The second question is for Mark. If I look at over the last couple of quarters. One of the big performance differences between you guys in the US comparing to your customers in Europe, they have far stronger Downstream results, mainly because of their marketing assets and also their trading operation. On that basis, do you think for Chevron that is the why rest of P, so that you may want to further boost your marketing? I mean you've been selling down your marketing assets both at the past 10 plus years. And for trading historically, you guys took out a facilitation call center, while your European peers are looking at the 4% [indiscernible] around the asset. So is that the right approach for you or that you don't think is fit for you. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Okay. Paul, I'll start. Look, we're going to be disciplined with our capital, that's true in our conventional business and you've seen that with the announcement of our organic capital budget that's true and our acquisitions, you saw that when we walked away from Anadarko and collected a billion dollar termination fee. And I think you've seen that and how we executed the Noble transaction being the first to announce and complete that as acquisition and it's going to be true in energy transition there. No one in Chevron has an open checkbook and, again that's true in our conventional business, that's true in our M&A, and that's true in energy transition. What you have seen is investments now that are on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars, we talked about $100 million into our marginal driven cost, curve investments $200 million in renewable natural gas. So the investments really are limited by what we believe or reflect what we believe are the opportunities that are again good for the environment, address climate change and good for our shareholders. In terms of, do we need to adopt this change in strategy, I think we've been pretty clear that we're not going to diversify away or divest from our core business. The actions we're taking around the energy transition are geared to making these businesses that are good businesses that play an important role in society and making them more sustainable in a lower carbon future. So I think you should expect us to continue to do that. We are going to operate in businesses where we have a competitive advantage, where we have a value proposition for shareholders that is advantage relative to other alternatives and again we're going to do that in a way that is part of a lower apartment future. So, maybe we'll go to Mark on the downstream question.\nMark Nelson: Thanks for the question, Paul. On the marketing question, we've consistently indicated that we are interested in strengthening our value chains. In fact, you could say that here in the third quarter that we've demonstrated the benefit of linking our refinery production to higher margin product placement and that's kind of our view of the value chain and I could -- I would suggest that the recent coolant transaction is an example of us strengthening our value chain in Asia, where we have essentially added terminals in retail stations in Australia where we can now place our Asian joint venture refinery production in a very strong market, where we own the strongest brand and we acquired that on June 30 and it's first three months and it's working just as we would have expected. So I think that goes to the concept of strengthening our value chain. To your comment on the trading portion of our portfolio, our trading businesses is designed first to ensure that we flow product, second that we optimize around those value chains and then we trade in those areas where we have demonstrated considerable expertise and it's vital to our downstream business, they are critical partners with regard to how we run our business and make those value chains work and they continue to look for opportunities to increase their impact. So I appreciate the question because the way we think about our value chains is important to us.\nPierre Breber: Okay. I'll just add, I think our shareholders support our approach to trading because I think they understand the other risk and volatility that can come to trading earnings and it generally attracts a little multiple because of that, in particular in a resource company, Paul, thanks for your questions. We appreciate it.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Leggate at Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mark, maybe I could take advantage of you being on the call. I just wonder if you could offer some perspectives on how you see this bottoming process of the downstream cycle playing out. What same process are you seeing in any of your markets in terms of any green shoots or any expectations that are going to be here for a while and I guess what's behind my question is, is Chevron totally done with rationalization in your downstream portfolio?\nMark Nelson: Well, I think it's a thoughtful question, you've given the unique situation. We're in the -- If I go back to the question, Neil asked about it relates to margins in general. I mentioned three things that we have to see to feel like we are on a path for greater sustainable margins in the downstream business, and it is that demand recovery for all high value products and you can see some of those things happening in our Asian markets where we see Australia past it's 2019 levels and we see certain Southeast Asian markets going beyond their levels and with our strong brand, we've been able to go past industry rates of growth in some of our areas. So I think those are opportunities that will help us on the demand side of the equation. The inventory reduction, I think the industry has demonstrated over time that we'll work through that, but that will take a little bit of time. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, the refinery rationalization as an industry, while we've done the predominance of our rationalization, we're always looking at strengthening the value chains in which we've chosen to compete and we'll continue to look at that over time, but the green shoot, I would say is the amount of companies that are announcing, suggested rationalizations and I think if those come through we might see getting to those recovered margins sooner than maybe -- we would naturally expect, we will presume that. We will stay focused on the self-help side of the equation and things that we can control like lowering our operating costs, certainly running efficiently with the desired yields and then using data analytics to place and price our products. So, we'll focus on what we can control. But we're hoping at some of those green shoots actually come to fruition.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. My follow-up is, for Pierre, if I may. Pierre, just some clarification on the CapEx, what is the cash CapEx number and related given the headcount reduction, and so on, what should we think as apples for apples operating cost reductions as we look at '21 versus '20, I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Yes. So again, we'll give all the details on our capital program when it's formally approved, but a cash equivalent excluding affiliates of about $10 billion is a good number to use right now. Well, I'm not sure I can say much more on OpEx, OpEx I think Devin asked that question, again, we have $1 billion of reductions we've seen this year, a 1 billion that we'll see next year through transformation, Noble synergies and as I said, we'll put that all together and provide some guidance here in the first quarter.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question is from Paul Sankey from Sankey Research.\nPaul Sankey: Morning, everyone. Can you hear me?\nPierre Breber: Yes. We hear you, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: Hi. You've talked about your industry-leading balance sheet and we've seen some incredible deterioration in values around various other oils, even globally. In terms of acquisitions, I assume that you're now very happy with your Permian position it feels as it's difficult to find anything that would improve your position. Can you talk a little bit about that and I assume that you don't want to add debt without there being a compelling opportunity, which I assume that kind of isn't globally, it just seems that you're in such a strong competitive position, I wonder if you're thinking about actually doing some more deals? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Paul. Look, we're focused on integrating Noble's successively and we're off to a really good start. I also talked about our transformation again as enterprise wide restructuring that we've been working on for almost a year now and will go in effect November 1 and so those are really our priorities. As we've said, we have a high bar for M&A and Noble cleared that bar and so it's quality assets, it meets our criteria of quality assets at a good value at the right time. I'm just not going to speculate about future M&A. If I do talk about our financial priorities, I mean, I think we've been pretty consistent and clear on what they are, to sustain and grow the dividend. We've done that for three straight years, invest to support long-term value and we're doing that in organic program and of course, we've done that through our Noble acquisition and maintain a strong balance sheet, which we've been able to do with a net debt ratio of 17.5%. In terms of the Permian, I think when you think you said it very well, we have a leading position, Noble provides a nice bolt-on, again our M&A is not focused necessarily on the Permian, it's focused on assets that are accretive to our shareholders, that are good value for our shareholders that add quality assets.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Paul.\nPierre Breber: Any follow-up,\nPaul Sankey: I do actually, it's totally different subject. Could you talk about your OpEx curtailments and anything you can add on the neutral zone? Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Yes, in terms of the neutral zone, the production was about 30,000 barrels a day, our share in the third quarter. So that start-up is going well. In terms of our curtailments overall, the guidance we provided was about 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent. So that's oil and gas equivalent and the majority of that is OPEC plus related. So 80% and 90% of that is OPEC plus related and that's again in countries like Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Angola.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: Just quickly, where you are headed on the neutral zone, just quickly, well go to?\nMark Nelson: We haven't provided any guidance. We're focused on continuing to have a safe and gradual ramp-up. So again we are at near 30,000 barrels a day Chevron share and we'll update you at year-end.\nPaul Sankey: Thank you, sir.\nMark Nelson: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria at RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. The first one I had was on just a clarification on TCO, the co-lending figure has gone down in the last couple of successive quarters. Is it safe to assume given you had issues mobilizing the workforce that's missing from 2020 just gets pushed 2021, that will be the first question?\nMark Nelson: Yes, so there are two parts to that. I mean, let me just address TCO project spending is about down 1 billion or share this year relative to what we had planned, in part due to the demobilization, but we've said about half of that are true cost efficiency savings and about half will be deferred to next year and future years. That's sort of related to the lending, but not entirely right. The lending is also dependent on dividend policy and prices, but you're correct that you've seen that the lending has come down, our guidance on it has come down during the course of the year, which is again a combination of lower project spending, but also where prices have gone.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Got it. Makes sense. And then the second question on a slightly different topic. But when you're looking at project sanctions and just in the context of your kind of energy transition approach, do you currently assume a carbon price even where countries themselves do not have a sort of fiscal framework in place, and if so can you kind of tell us what the carbon price you're using as?\nPierre Breber: Yes, we don't disclose our price forecast for oil and gas prices, we think it's commercially sensitive. We don't disclose our carbon price forecast. We look at it under a variety of scenarios for both commodity prices and carbon pricing and we look at it by jurisdiction because it can vary, the investments that Mark referred to, certainly they are our policy supported, so they generate in some cases, low carbon fuel credits or Renewable Fuel Standard, the federal standard. And so again. It really varies by jurisdiction. We are looking at returns, again, we're trying to make investments in energy transition that are both good for the environment and good for shareholders and some of that return is policy enabled, but it really does vary by jurisdiction.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks Biraj.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Thank you Pierre. Thanks\nOperator: We'll go next to Roger Read at Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Thank you. Good morning.\nPierre Breber: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: Yes. Two questions I have for you. The first. I know you said all the modules are in Kazakhstan now but any more update you can provide like how many people are actually able to muster to the site and kind of thought process as we head into the typically slower winter season for what this might imply for budgetary and timeframe of a start-up on the next pages.\nPierre Breber: Yes. Thanks, Roger. Look the remobilization is going well and I said we're near 15,000 of workforce on the project and we're heading to end the year above 20. So far our safeguards are working well, we've kept the rate of infection, very low and we're seeing our work progress in line with expectations. So the key for us going forward to holding cost and schedule is to complete the remobilization, sustain a full workforce during the pandemic using our safeguards and achieve our progress milestone. So we're -- as you say, we're in the, I would say early days. We're in the middle of the remobilization, we're heading into winter, we need to see how this all progresses and we'll know more by our Investor Day, and we plan to provide an update there. Having all material and modules, on the ground is a really important milestone. It doesn't mean that we are now can just address all of the work in place and so that's -- those are really the keys for us going forward in terms of again maintaining cost and schedule.\nRoger Read: Okay, great. And then a quick unrelated follow-up, what could, as you look across your various operations leave Noble out of this, but when it comes, getting everybody's pad drilling. Just curious if you see anything in the way of decline rates that are either better or worse than what you would have anticipated thinking whether it's Permian or The Gulf of Mexico or just International.\nPierre Breber: The short answer is no, we're not seeing any surprises. I mean the Permian, is a little bit higher than our early guidance if you recall at our market response press release, I think it was March 24 to March 25, we guided to the exit rate on the Permian being down 20%, it will be a little bit better than that. So our production in the Permian was 565,000 barrels oil equivalent. We think our exit rate that's a Chevron only. We think our exit rate will be around 550 and again that's a little better than we had guided to back in March. Now we'll have the Noble Permian production on top of that, that's about 50. So we expect to be near 600. So we're managing, again we're sustaining, we are managing declines very well. We are not putting a lot of capital to add short-term production because of oversupplied markets, but we're pleased with how we're operating upstream just like Mark has talked about safe and reliable operations, we're seeing the same on our upstream operations.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Roger.\nRoger Read: Great, thanks.\nOperator: We'll move next to Sam Margolin at Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thank you.\nWayne Borduin: Good morning, Sam.\nSam Margolin: My question is about your renewable gas business. If you look at the California Air Resource Board carbon intensity scores, actually, when I first saw it, I thought it was a mistake because renewable gases like a negative 400 or something, totally off the charts. I guess you're constrained by the CNG market, which I don't know how big it is, but given the emissions benefits of this product, are you able to offset all or at least a significant amount of your obligations from the refining business under the LCFS.\nMark Nelson: Hey, Sam, this is Mark. Thank you. Thank you for the question and the kind of recognition of why we would be considering the renewable natural gas as part of our value chain. I mean we should expect us to be a strong player in the RNG space and policy enabled markets like the West. As you've indicated, it is the most cost and carbon efficient fuel from an LCFS and RFS perspective and it's actually low execution risk and so it leverages our strength, our ability to partner with folks, especially the feedstock side and then our ability to place the product, we've got to your second element that you need to put this over time and so we're excited about the CalBio and the CalBio and even the adopter ports announcements that we've made, and I think you'll see us continue to wisely grow here.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks for the questions.\nSam Margolin: Sure. Okay. And I mean, I guess just it's a related follow-up. But one of the things that you've said that I think is differentiated from a corporate level is that you manage your capital planning not really on the basis of prices, but on how you see the demand outlook shaking out or directionally because you know the price can change and it might not necessarily reflect actual conditions, but so in light of that, you mentioned that we're transitioning to a low carbon world. Some things could change depending on the election, but can this renewable gas business if there really is market share to be had, can it scale beyond California, what other geographic footprints are out there for you and basically just in terms of scope what are you thinking here.\nMark Nelson: Yes, the short answer is growth is clearly plausible. We tend to look at this in regard to our existing value chains, where we have our strengths and where we can execute well and we'll consider growth in that context, but there is certainly upside potential.\nSam Margolin: Okay, thank you so much.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Sam.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Sam.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Manav Gupta at Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: Thank you for taking my question. You have two high-class refining assets in California and we saw that the earnings are stronger in the downstream as Neil pointed out, the governor over there is indicating that he wants to ban the internal combustion engine in 2035, the sale of new vehicles, is that any way changing the way you plan your business in California, or you think that he does not have the legal authority as many legal experts are pointing out.\nMark Nelson: Well, thanks for the -- thank you for the question. I'm actually a native of California when I think about California, I think of generally under normal conditions, a very strong economy and a tremendous desire for affordable mobility. And with that backdrop for the foreseeable future, to be successful in California from a fuels perspective, I think you have to have reliable refineries, a strong brand to both the place the product and to keep a connection with the customer and an ability to participate in California's lower-carbon future. And we've been here in California, for over 100 years and I think we are well positioned to engage with the government to build a path towards a lower carbon future and we will actively participate that and believe we can do so.\nManav Gupta: Okay. A quick follow-up is, you have had two Noble assets for about a month is, are there any upside surprises, thoughts like synergies that you think you can do better on any integration, you think you can do better on since you acquired those assets.\nMark Nelson: Yes, thanks Manav. Look it is going very well and again we're pleased to have been the first to announce a transaction and to complete it, it's a good fit, and I won't go through all of that, again, a very successful first month. Synergies are on track, we expect that there will be more as we operate as one company. In the first few weeks, we've been able, for example, to see contracts and look at procurement opportunities. We're also starting to see operational synergies, we'll update you sometime in the first quarter, just let us, give us some time to fully assess the opportunities. We expect the synergy number to be higher. I don't have a number for you. We're going to do that work and will advise you in due course.\nManav Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: We take our next question from Jason Gabelman at Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Yes, hey, I wanted to circle back to this Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, which it seems like a useful framework to use moving forward. Two kind of related questions on it, one does this enables you to kind of get to net zero by 2030, it seems like your European peers are pushing towards that and I'm assuming the US is going to ultimately face pressure to hit net zero on its own emissions by 2030. And do you have any sense of what you'd be able, what do you need to spend to achieve that now that you have this kind of cost curve model and does Algonquin, the partnership with Algonquin, how does that kind of figure into this, I think you've been a partner with them for a couple of quarters, just wondering if that unlocks some of the opportunities within the goal of reducing carbon intensity? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Yes, Jason, look we support the Paris Agreement and as Mark says, we're going to be part of the lower carbon energy future. Our focus is on results not pledges. And so what you're seeing at our actions today and that are addressing carbon intensity, I'm just not going to get further. We have our 2023 carbon intensity metrics I referred to earlier that we're likely to update those in time to get them the next stock take periods, but our approach again is really focused on delivering results that we think address climate change and are good for the environment. In terms of Algonquin, it's early days, but yes, we see opportunities there, that does both, right, it sort of increases renewables and support of our business. You've seen us do that in the Permian and in Bakersfield with wind and solar projects that are providing power to our operations that we otherwise are buying off the grid and Algonquin is working on opportunities in other areas of Chevron operations. It does take a little bit of time. Yes, I do some of the engineering work in the development work, but so far that joint venture is going well.\nJason Gabelman: All right. And just a clarification, I appreciate on slide 9 you included downstream earnings excluding timing effects, which is definitely useful, was that a disclosure you plan on including going forward and 3Q '20 does imply kind of no timing effects this quarter, just looking at where the graph, where the bar is on the graph. Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Yes, Jason. So in the very, the last slide in the appendix, you see that we actually give the absolute timing effects for US International Downstream. So for a long time, we've been showing the variance. But as you said, you can figure out the absolutes in each quarter. So now we've shown that for going back to 2017. And, Yes, you should expect us to continue to do that going forward.\nJason Gabelman: Great. That's helpful, thanks a lot.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Jason.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: We'll go next to Pavel Molchanov at Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking my question. You do not have a massive footprint in Europe compared to just about all the other supermajors, but I am curious, your thought on another regulatory issue, the European Climate law, getting ready to be passed five weeks from now and what the impact on your upstream and or Downstream operations might be?\nPierre Breber: Well, as you say Pavel although we've operated in Europe upstream and downstream for many decades and I worked there in Aberdeen when the first carbon tax was enacted. We sold the majority of our upstream operations, we have a little non-op position still, and again no large-scale refining or marketing. We do have some lubricants and additives businesses in there. So I think again we support the Paris accord, we believe the future of energy is lower carbon, we expect more policy. I think it gets to what Mark was trying to, was addressing is getting the balance between those worthwhile policy goals and providing affordable reliable energy that the world economies need.\nPavel Molchanov: Two quick follow-ups, since we're a week ahead of the election. Can you remind us on the combined Chevron but Noble, Permian acreage position? How much of the acreage is federal?\nPierre Breber: Yes, it's about 10% is federal in terms of total Permian acreage.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Pavel.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Neil Dingman at Trust Securities.\nNeil Dingmann: Good morning -- afternoon now, guys. I was hoping just you've talked a lot about these details on the renewables, but my question was more particularly on the Novvi partnership, I'm just wondering, again on that out of your facilities, can you talk about maybe some details on what industries you all might target once that starts rolling out of that facility?\nPierre Breber: Well, so the concept for our downstream business is to provide a renewable base oil to round out our base oil offering both for our own business and for the business of others, the product itself, which is a technology partnership between ourselves leveraging our ISODEWAXING technology and some other patented solutions allows us to create, to take multiple types of bio feedstocks internally into what I would consider higher-performing base oils. There are other applications, even in cosmetics and things like that, that will be investigated over time, but we do see an opportunity for expansion of that joint venture should be as economics continue to warranted. Thank you. Thanks for the question.\nNeil Dingmann: Sure. And then one maybe just quick follow-up on that, it was you certainly are doing a great job of continuing to move not only Novvi but CalBioGas and just continue to move in the renewables in general. Do you all have sort of any target or kind of metrics on where you would like to be as far as what you think renewables might be is a part of your potential total part of your business, two or three years from now, or is it just too early to determine that?\nMark Nelson: I'll give the first answer on this, then maybe Pierre can build on this. I think it's too early for us to say about how big it could become. But we do intend to continue to grow it as part of our -- as part of our business. I think we can do that successfully. While we return -- while we improve returns as well. Pierre, would you add anything.\nPierre Breber: Yes, this was well said. So again, I think I addressed earlier. No one has an open checkbook in Chevron to spend money on, that's true in the conventional business and acquisitions and energy transition. We're going to pursue the opportunities that are good for the environment, good for our shareholders, and it will grow over time.\nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Neil.\nNeil Dingmann: Thanks for your time guys.\nWayne Borduin: We've got through all the questions in the queue. And I want to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Audra, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-07-31 20:26:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead, sir. \nWayne Borduin: Thank you, Audra, and welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Now, I'll turn it over to Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Wayne. Second quarter was a challenging one for the company. Financial results included $4.9 billion in special item net charges and a foreign exchange loss of over $400 million. Excluding special items and FX, the quarter resulted in a $3 billion loss or $1.59 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Cash flow from operations was about $100 million, and total capital spending was $03.3 billion, including about $300 million for the Puma Energy, Australia acquisition. Asset sale proceeds for the quarter were about $1.5 billion related to the sale of our Azerbaijan and Colombia upstream businesses. Our dividend was flat with the prior quarter, and we maintained a strong balance sheet. Turning to slide 4. In the second quarter, we recorded over $5 billion in impairments and other non-cash charges. The charges were triggered by the uncertain operating environment and outlook in Venezuela, a lower oil and gas price forecast, due to the anticipated economic impacts of COVID-19 and severance accruals resulting from our transformation initiative. While we are disappointed by the impairment in Venezuela, we intend to maintain a presence in the country and resume normal operations one day. The price-related impairments were primarily related to Stampede, a non-operated field in the Gulf of Mexico; conventional operations in the Permian; and various producing assets in Asia and Africa. These charges were partially offset by a gain on asset sales and various tax items. Turning to slide 5. We remain on track to meet our revised guidance for 2020 capital and operating cost reductions. Organic CapEx in the second quarter was $3 billion, already at a run rate 40% below the original budget. Full year capital guidance remains unchanged at $14 billion, as we will need to see sustained economic recovery and much lower inventories before considering raising activity levels. Operating costs are also trending lower, in line with our expectation of $1 billion savings compared to 2019. Organization design from our transformation efforts is complete. Employee selections are underway, and we expect to be operating under our new model in the fourth quarter, delivering additional run rate savings next year. Turning to the next slide. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're on track to grow the dividend for the 33rd straight year. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was low due to the market environment. This was partially offset by lower cash CapEx and asset sale proceeds. Higher debt this quarter included our successful bond issuance in May. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt ratio below 17%, well ahead of our competitors. Turning to slide 7. Second quarter earnings were low -- were lower due to a swing of over $6 billion in special items and FX versus the same period last quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower prices, including greater differentials to benchmark crudes due to market volatility and reduced liftings volumes, primarily due to curtailments and prior upstream asset sales. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes to match decreased demand and unfavorable timing effects. Turning to slide 8, compared to the first quarter, second quarter adjusted earnings decreased by over $5 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased by about $3 billion, primarily due to lower liquids realizations, lower sales volumes mainly due to curtailments and an unfavorable swing in timing effects. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased by almost $2 billion, primarily due to an unfavorable swing in timing effects, lower margins and lower sales volumes. Chevron's refinery system ran reliably during the quarter, with crude utilization well below capacity due to lower demand. The other segment decreased primarily due to an unfavorable swing in accruals for stock-based compensation. I'll now pass it over to Jay.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Pierre. On slide 9, second quarter oil equivalent production, excluding asset sales, was flat compared to a year ago. During the quarter, increased Permian shale and tight production and higher entitlement effects were offset primarily by curtailments and turnarounds. The curtailments were at the low end of our guidance range as prices recovered from historic lows late in the quarter. I'm really proud that our employees have kept our upstream operations running safely and reliably during this global pandemic. With all of the challenges of moving people and equipment, and of course, personal concerns at home, our employees have risen to the occasion to deliver the energy needed in recovering economies. Turning to the Permian. We're making disciplined choices to balance short-term cash flow, while preserving long-term value. In response to the current market conditions, we quickly reduced our flexible capital program across the portfolio and in the Permian, expect quarterly capital spend in the second half of the year to be about 75% lower than the first quarter. As of July, we've reduced our operated rig count to four with one completion crew. Although the level of activity in the Permian has rapidly changed, our focus on efficiency has not. By the end of this year, we expect to double the lateral feet drilled per rig compared to 2018. With lower capital investments and our improving efficiency, we still expect to be free cash flow positive this year at strip pricing. As shown on slide 11, the short-term outlook for Permian production has changed as a result of the lower capital spending. After curtailments in May and June, we're back to full production and expect second half production to be in line with the first half. At current activity levels, we expect production to decline about 6% to 7% in 2021. Early next year, we'll update 2021 production guidance for the Permian and the rest of Chevron's upstream portfolio. As stated in our first quarter 10-Q, we expect lower capital spending to result in the demotion of proved undeveloped reserves, primarily in the Permian. These barrels may be rebooked as proved reserves when funding and activity levels increase. The near-term production profile for the Permian has changed, but our long-term view of the asset's attractiveness has not. With our scale, efficient factory drilling, and royalty advantage, we believe we're well-positioned to maximize returns and deliver value. Turning to TCO. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, we continue to make progress with our future growth wellhead pressure management project at Tengiz, and the project is now 79% complete. All site fabrication is complete, and all modules have now departed Korea. Our logistics system is working well, and we expect to receive all the remaining modules in Tengiz this year. The remaining project scope is primarily the construction and commissioning work in Tengiz. We made excellent progress on site construction through the end of last year and the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter, as a result of the COVID pandemic, we reduced our construction workforce to 20% of plan. As a result, overall construction progress has been impacted due to the limited construction workforce. Let's turn to the next slide. TCO is working hard to mitigate the risk from the pandemic by closely coordinating with health experts and regulatory agencies to implement safeguards that protect our workforce. Looking ahead to the second half of 2020, the project team is focused on remobilizing the Tengiz construction workforce and completing the final sealift. A return to work planned for about 20,000 FGP construction personnel is set to begin in August, and we will continue as conditions allow. Critical path activities such as the delivery and installation of the first two pressure boost compressor modules remain on track. Foundations and access roads are complete, and the team is preparing to receive, restack and install these modules. With the high field productivity and progress over the winter, we were ahead of schedule but now have limited schedule float remaining. Our ability to complete the remobilization and sustain the construction workforce through the pandemic is key to limiting further impacts to the project. We're focused on safely progressing the project, and we expect to be able to provide more specific updates to project cost and schedule early next year. Now I'll give it back to Pierre. Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Jay. Slide 14 highlights some recent announcements. On July 1st, we safely started up production in the Partition Zone and completed the first export this week. Also, we closed the acquisition of Puma Energy, Australia. These assets will integrate with our refining and marketing value chain in Asia Pacific and extend the valued Caltex brand in the region. Earlier this month, we signed an agreement with Algonquin, a leader in renewable power generation, to co-develop renewable power projects that will support our operations. Initial project assessments will be focused on the Permian, Argentina, Kazakhstan and Australia. Turning to the next slide. Last week, we announced we had reached an agreement to acquire Noble Energy. As the necessary regulatory and approval steps progress, we've also launched our integration planning efforts. Representatives from both companies are meeting today to kick-off the planning discussion, and we look forward to integrating Noble's complementary assets, people and capabilities into Chevron. Looking ahead, we anticipate a straightforward and fast integration. Our internal transformation efforts should help us efficiently integrate the new organization and achieve our synergy targets. Now looking forward on slide 16, in the third quarter, we expect production curtailments of about 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day primarily due to the OPEC+ agreement. Planned turnarounds, primarily in Australia, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada, are expected to impact production by about 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes an extension of the turnaround at Gorgon until early September. In Australia, we expect LNG contract pricing to be lower due to the 3 month to 6 month lag with oil prices. Based on our current outlook, full year net production is expected to be roughly flat with 2019, including the effects of curtailment. And TCO co-lending is expected to be about $2 billion for the year. In downstream, turnaround activity is estimated to have an after-tax earnings impact of $100 million to $200 million. We expect our other segment earnings and distributions less affiliate income to be in line with prior guidance, excluding the impact of this quarter's special items. Turning to our last slide. With health, economic and social crises all happening at the same time, this was a challenging quarter for Chevron and its stakeholders and a reminder of the importance of the S in ESG. We're proud of the work we're doing with social investments in our communities, pay equity for our employees and our supply chain spend with women and minority-owned businesses. You can read about this and more in our sustainability report, which was published in the second quarter. So with concerns for the health of our loved ones, economic uncertainty in our communities and expectations for racial justice and equal opportunity, we know that there's more work to do. On the right of the slide is the company's five-point action plan in response to current market conditions. We're proud of how our employees are executing this plan and delivering on what we can control. We entered this crisis in a better place than our competitors, and we intend to exit stronger and more valuable for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Wayne. \nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue. So please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Audra, please open the lines. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Gresh at JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh: Yes, hi good morning. First question is just kind of tying together the commentary in the Permian for next year being down 6% to 7% with your CapEx commentary that you've provided, which I think in the past, you've said $3 billion quarterly run rate for second half CapEx on a C&E basis, not on a cash CapEx basis. So, is the Permian commentary consistent with just keeping that CapEx at that type of run rate in the second half of the year? \nPierre Breber: Yes. So, we had an approved budget of $20 billion. When we announced our market response plan and then updated it at our earnings call, we reduced the full year to $14 billion average, but a run rate of $12 billion essentially for the second half of the year. We achieved that a quarter early. So, if you back out the Puma Energy (Australia) acquisition, we were at $3 billion already in the second quarter and that's obviously at that $12 billion annual run rate, which is a 40% reduction. And embedded in that are the reductions that Jay referred to in the Permian and operating at the current 4 rigs and one completion crew. \nPhil Gresh: Okay, got it. So, you keep it at that level in 2021 for a 6% to 7% decline?\nPierre Breber: Well, yes, I'm sorry. So, yes, we haven't given capital guidance for 2021. We're in the middle of our planning process. We'll do our normal disclosure and sharing of what our capital budget is for 2021 in December when we've completed our plan and the Board has approved the plan. What we are showing is it's just an outlook based on current activity level. We, early on, guided to Permian production being about 20% lower on the exit rate from -- relative to our Investor Day guidance. And actually, we're doing a bit better than that. So that would have taken us down a little bit lower than what you're seeing on that chart. And then executing this plan and staying at this activity level, yes, we project that kind of guidance. We're not giving production guidance. There's a lot of time between now and then. We're just sort of showing what the outlook looks like if activity levels stay at the same level. It will depend on what the economic recovery is, with inventory levels and a number of factors will determine what our activity level will be in the Permian going forward.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, got it. My second question just would be on Gorgon. There have been some media reports out there talking about some operational hiccups on Train 2 and getting that restarted, I think, you were planning in mid-July. It sounds like maybe it's early September at this point. But could you just elaborate on what's happening there? What the root cause of this delay is? And what it would mean for being able to meet contractual obligations? I think you're about 80% contracted at Gorgon, but just any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nJay Johnson: Yes. Phil, I'll take that one. So, our fundamental concern is operating safely and reliably and we're always going to take decisions in alignment with that. As part of our normal operations, we take trains down for turnarounds to do inspections and maintenance. And during the Train 2 turnaround, what we found in the Train 2 propane heat exchangers or kettle, some call them, we saw some well defects. So, we developed a repair procedure, and they're progressing well on those repairs. We expect them to be fully accomplished here in the near term, and we expect to have the train up and running in early September. All the other planned work for the turnaround has already been completed. So, the focus really is just on completing these repairs to the propane heat exchangers. We're going to use the findings from what we saw in train 2 to plan the appropriate actions for train 1 and train 3. But at this point, train 1 and 3 run normally as expected. And we've actually seen good stable operations out of them. So at this point, there have not been challenges in delivering on our commitments, and I don't anticipate that as we look forward.\nWayne Borduin: Okay. Thank you, Phil.\nOperator: We'll move next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.\nJason Gammel: Thanks very much. I guess the first question I have for Pierre is it's obviously a pretty tough quarter. But, I wasn't necessarily expecting cash from operations ex-working capital to be negative. So can you address if there's anything in the quarter that is sort of a one-off item that affected the cash number? Or is this just purely the result of the core pricing margin environment?\nPierre Breber: So, look, it was a challenging quarter. We did -- to put in perspective, we had a big beat last quarter, and we had a miss this quarter. And one of the primary drivers we talked about last quarter and -- or we talked about this morning is our timing effects. And as you know, Jason, these are effects that benefit us in a falling oil price environment and reverse in a rising oil price environment. And we saw that, obviously, prices declining in the first quarter and rising in the second quarter. And some of those effects do roll through cash because it's essentially going through our COGS, and it's a timing difference between when COGS are being recognized relative to the underlying margin. In addition to that, look, we had very volatile industry conditions. As you know, we had historic -- historically low prices at times, very volatile pricing. And there were times where we did not capture what the benchmark crudes are indicating. And that was true in the U.S. in certain times with the calendar role and the physical differentials, which we're adjusting very quickly, but it was a very fast-moving situation. And it was true outside the U.S. for certain crudes. CPC blend at times was being discounted more heavily versus Brent. Some of our West African crudes also are being discounted more heavily versus Brent than is typical in a normal trading pattern. And then, we ran much lower utilization on the downstream than is typical. Again, we had unprecedented demand decreases, rapidly changing demand decreases. We were managing our refinery system to be in sync with the demand. In the U.S., we ran -- our crew utilization was 55%, which is well below what the capacity is. And it just points out how extraordinary the conditions were in the second quarter. So that results in much lower volumes than we typically would sell and resulting impact on margins. The last thing I'd point out on earnings and it's not a cash effect is, we do make accruals for stock-based compensation for all employees that have stock-based compensation. And in the first quarter, that was favorable, and there was a swing. So, there's no doubt, there's some non-cash elements in the earnings, but realizations, volumes and aspects of the timing also roll through cash. There was nothing, I would say, that was unusual except the industry conditions that were very unusual and extraordinary.\nJason Gammel: No, I appreciate that, Pierre. Hopefully, we won't ever see another quarter like this past one. Second question is for Jay. Jay, this is the first time, we've been able to speak with you since the Noble acquisition was announced. I was hoping you might be able to give us your view of the quality and fit of those assets into the Chevron portfolio, and specifically interested in the Permian acreage, and your view on the East Med and the potential for future expansion.\nJay Johnson: Yeah. Thank you. Jason. We're obviously excited to have these assets join our portfolio. I think they're a really nice set of assets, and they have an excellent fit with us. In the case of the Eastern Med and the DJ Basin, we see two new scale -- operations of scale that fit quite well into our capabilities. We've worked for many years in the Middle East, and this is a nice addition to our current portfolio. In Colorado, we're excited to have an entry into the DJ that has such a long running room and good returns. In the Permian, it's a nice add-on to our existing Permian operations in the Delaware Basin and about 90,000 acres coming into our portfolio. So we see good synergies there. And then there are other assets in the Noble portfolio that will be nice assets to have. We'll continue to start evaluating their performance. And just on balance, I'm happy with what's coming into the portfolio. I think it's going to be a really good fit, and there's a lot of good people in the Noble organization as well. We're looking forward to bringing them into the family.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nJay Johnson: Good morning, Devin.\nDevin McDermott: So my first one is on TCO, and just following up on some of the prepared remarks, Jay, that you had. And when we think about the critical path here for the back half of 2020 and really into the next few years, you noted that you have all the materials on site to achieve that critical path. But I wanted to ask specifically on the remobilization of the workforce and how you're planning that to continue to achieve execution on the critical path items as we think about the overall project time line, any risk of delays? Just a little bit more detail on how you're thinking about the interplay there with the critical path and remobilization of workforce?\nJay Johnson: Yeah. Thank you. Well, as we've said, we made great progress over the wintertime, and we're actually building ahead of the schedule with the modules being completed on time and coming to us. They're coming to us complete with good quality and dimensionally accurate. So they're meeting all of our expectations, and we expect to have the sealift finished this year. Those are all key elements in maintaining schedule on the project. From the workforce on the ground standpoint, Kazakhstan, like many other countries is going through a significant impact from the COVID. And so as part of our precautions, we demobilized to about 20% of the planned workforce in the second quarter. That's about 20,000 workers that we need to bring back. During June and July, we've been doing a crew change on those people that were remaining in Tengiz, and that's given us a chance to test the systems that we've been putting in place. And those involve testing people at their point of origin before they return to Tengiz. Once they get to Tengiz, we have isolation camps set up, so that we can put people in isolation. Even with negative tests, we still put them in isolation to affect the quarantine period then retest before they're allowed to progress to Tengiz. We're using a pod strategy where we keep groups of workers together but isolated from other groups, and that includes where they live, transportation, how they take meals, trying to make sure we have sufficient mitigations in place to protect that workforce. Our fundamental concern is the safety of the workforce and making sure that we can sustain operations as we rebuild. We expect that mobilization to take place over about a four-month period. But clearly, that's going to be dependent upon the environment in Kazakhstan, as well as just the difficulty of moving people internationally for a project of this scale. And we'll take the learnings as we've done the crew change and continue to adapt as we move forward into the remobilization. Our focus continues on critical path activities, but we've got to also work off a large volume of work that didn't get done in the second quarter. And so to really -- we expect some degree of impact, but to really be able to give you any kind of an updated forecast on cost or schedule, we need to see how this remobilization goes. We need to see how we're able to sustain people at work within the pandemic, and we'll be able to update you, I think, more effectively probably in the first quarter of next year. \nQ \u2013 Devin McDermott: Got it. That's very helpful. And my second question is one relating to the U.S. election and a short-term and a longer-term part. And the shorter-term part is there's a lot of discussion around potential permitting or leasing changes, specifically on federal lands and waters. And one, just how you're thinking about managing that potential risk, given the large presence in the Gulf of Mexico?  And the second part of the question and this is the longer-term piece. There's also some discussion around things like clean energy standard or investments from the federal government into things like clean hydrogen over time. And just how you're thinking about managing the business from an investment strategy longer-term to position Chevron for this potential shifting regulatory environment, maybe within the recent announcement on the renewables partnership with Algonquin and how that fits in the longer-term strategy as well? \nPierre Breber: Sure, Devin, I'll start and let Jay address the question on federal leasing. I mean, at the highest level, look, we work well at the federal state and local levels in this country with governments of both parties. And of course, we work with governments with different priorities all around the world.  Energy is essential as the economy and the world economies recover from this pandemic and jobs in oil and gas are good paying jobs and are a big part of the economy in a number of states in the U.S. and a number of countries around the world. We think whichever governments in the U.S. or in other countries, the economy will be a priority coming out of this and we think energy will be a big part of that. We're a very responsible company, including our commitment to ESG, which I referred to, and actions we're taking to reduce carbon intensity. So I think our approach on energy transition has three focus areas, things that we can do to lower our carbon intensity.  We have greenhouse gas intensity metrics out to 2023, how we can increase renewables and support our business. So the Algonquin partnership we just announced is just a way to scale up but we've been doing previously. We had some wind and solar to our operations in the Permian and in Bakersfield. And this gives us an alliance and partnership to accelerate that and scale it up globally. We continue to do in the renewable space, renewable natural gas, renewable liquid fuels, actions that reduce the carbon intensity of our products, in particular in California, consistent with the low-carbon fuel standard. And then our third focus area is investing in breakthrough technologies and that includes carbon sequestration, hydrogen, batteries. We are operating the world's -- one of the world's largest carbon sequestration projects in Australia. So that's a long answer to say, we've been in business a long time. We intend to be in business a long time. There are elections in this country and a number of countries that are occurring. And we intend to be a constructive force wherever we operate, to be a good partner with whoever is governing at that time. And we think there's a lot of common ground that we can find between what we do as a company and what governments aspire to do. So with that, I'll turn it to Jay. \nA - Jay Johnson: Thanks, Pierre. I'll build on that by just saying I think there's actually a lot of common ground with where the potential administrations want to go. Because we've already been focused on reducing flaring and methane emissions, our greenhouse gas intensity and producing oil and gas, we've had a head start on this. And we continue to stay focused on reducing the impact that we have as we produce these essential products. We think energy plays an essential role in economic growth. And these jobs in the Gulf of Mexico and the Permian are important jobs to the economy. And I think the emphasis on natural gas as a bridging fuel continues to support our operations in both the Gulf of Mexico and Permian. So we'll continue to focus on reducing emissions and lowering our footprint, carbon footprint. But at the same time, we're going to continue to work with whatever administration is in place and work to make sure that the \u2013 there's a good understanding of potential regulation and the impacts that it may have as we move forward.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Devin.\nOperator: We'll go next to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs. \nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team and thank you for taking the time here. The first question I had is around cash flow breakeven. In the past, Pierre, you've talked about cash flow after CapEx breakeven after 40 at 50, the dividend and at 60, the buyback. Just how do you think about that math there now? There are a lot of moving pieces, particularly with downstream, and there's a lot of flexibility on the CapEx side. But any math you can help us think about your rent breakevens would be helpful for aligning the models?\nPierre Breber: Well, Neil, I mean, you're exactly right. When we talk about oil breakevens, we're just talking about one part of the portfolio and not everything else is held constant. So we've had \u2013 we've shown breakevens in the 50s. The actions that we're taking is to get it down in the 40s. That has an assumption around downstream performance, and you will see that in the second quarter. But you'll see that certainly over time. I guess I just would first step back and just say we're in a different place than almost everyone else in our industry. We have one of the strongest balance sheets. We're exiting the quarter here with a net debt ratio of 17%. We've got excellent capital discipline and the ability to flex our capital program down. You saw that we took it down 40% in one quarter with an extraordinary change in the circumstances, reserving the capital and not spending capital to add barrels that just aren't needed, right now as the world is contracting and then coming out of it and hopefully recovering in a sustainable way. We've been ahead of others. We started our asset sales and signed asset sales last year. And you saw those close this quarter, generating cash. And again, we started our restructuring well before COVID, and we're on plan. And we have that work on track. And of course, we signed an agreement to acquire Noble Energy last week. So we \u2013 all of our actions are designed consistent with our financial priorities. The first is to sustain and grow the dividend. We showed our stress test last quarter, $30, that I think was made very clear that we have the financial capability and the flexibility in our capital program, the ability to manage our costs to sustain that dividend through what is a stress test. And we're continuing to sustain long-term value of the business. So although, we're taking activity back in the Permian because it brings on production in months and not years, that capital will come back when the world needs the energy, and the value inherent in that resource is still there. And of course, we're making investments as Jay has talked about in Tengiz, which will come on in several years. And again, we're maintaining a strong balance sheet. So that's the high-level framework. Our goal is to get our breakeven as obviously as low as we can. We're planning for lower for longer. It's a very uncertain environment to Jason's question. We hope second quarter was the bottom. It sure feels like it. Things are definitely better than they were in the second quarter, in particular in that April-May time frame. But we've got a plan for lower for longer, show our downside resiliency. We know how to manage the upside. That won't be a problem, but make sure we support the long-term value, so that we can not only just pay the dividend now, but sustain and grow it over time.\nJay Johnson: Yes. Just to build on that a little bit, Pierre. One of the things I really like about the assets as well coming from Noble is that they also have great capital flexibility. So it fits our strategy quite well. And about 75% of the proved reserves have already been developed. So the big capital is largely in the past, and now we're looking at the -- run opportunities for these assets.\nNeil Mehta: Appreciate it. And a follow-up here is around impairments. You took $4.8 billion in the quarter. Can you just talk about the framework by which you look at impairments? Obviously, your system is a little different than the IFRS system of some of your competitors. Do you think you're through the bulk of said impairments? And just talk about your approach to calibrating them?\nPierre Breber: Sure. Well, let me start with fourth quarter when we took large impairments and those were primarily related to capital decisions, right? Decisions that we made that were primarily natural gas-related. And this, again, of course, is pre-COVID, but in a capital disciplined way and trying to drive higher returns, being really ruthless about where our capital is invested and making difficult choices. And that was primarily the impact of the impairments that we saw in the fourth quarter. This quarter, it was primarily for two reasons: one, unique situation, Venezuela, which I'll comment on, and I'm sure Jay will add to; and we did lower our price outlook based on the economic impacts from the global pandemic. So we don't know what the impacts will be. But clearly, with the economic contraction and assuming economic recovery clearly, but it just results in lower demand for some time period. And we reflected that in lower prices. So in Venezuela, it's been a difficult operating environment for a while. Each quarter, we've been assessing our investment value. In the second quarter, the environment became even more difficult. As an example, our net production -- our share of net production in June was just 7,000 barrels a day. So it's really fallen off. And so under the accounting rules and the U.S. GAAP accounting rules, we have to assess whether the loss in value is other than temporary. And if we view it as other than temporary, we take an impairment. And unlike IFRS, it's a one -- it only goes in one direction. The other ones were tied to the oil price, and I talked about a few of those, and then we had a severance. So again, we follow U.S. GAAP. We're going to look at it each quarter. What I can say is the impairments this quarter, for the most part, had a different nature than last quarter. And maybe one comment on the price-related ones, and I'll kick it to Jay to talk about Venezuela. The price-related ones are really hitting either mature assets, late-in-life assets, where the remaining production term just gets impacted by the lower price outlook. The long-lived assets all are -- were not impaired. It was really mature remaining short-life direction -- duration where a lower price impacts the carrying value. But maybe Jay can comment on Venezuela.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Pierre. Venezuela, we took the impairment there, but our fundamental approach has not changed. And that's what we are still committed to being present in Venezuela, and we look forward to one day resuming full operations. Our license was extended to the 1st of December, 2020, and that license allows us to take on the activities for safety and maintaining asset integrity. And our focus is on keeping people and the assets and operations safe. We support communities in Venezuela. We believe we're a force for good. We'll continue to be compliant with all laws and regulations, both in U.S. and Venezuela. And we just take it a day at a time, but our commitment still remains. And we think the underlying asset value is still there.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll move next to Paul Sankey at Sankey Research.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, everyone. Can you hear me okay?\nPierre Breber: Yes. Hi, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: Hi. Thanks. A couple of things. Firstly, on problems that you had in the quarter, a couple of the other mega oil companies had very good trading results. Was it fair to characterize you guys as having a smaller trading operation and appetite, as a result of us not seeing a whole lot of benefit in the quarter, I was just wondering? And the second follow-up is, you mentioned breakeven. I think, Jay, and I'm sure Jay in his comments also mentioned breakeven. I thought he said breakeven at strip by the end of the year. So are you talking about getting down towards 40? Did I -- if I got that wrong in my head? Could you just clarify what's in those various moving parts? It might be downstream or I might have missed that, apologies. But if you could just bring that together for me. Thanks a lot.\nPierre Breber: Okay. Let me just address the breakeven question. And I think that was me -- or who? Devin asked that. Well, anyway, whoever asked it. So, again, our breakeven in last year and early this quarter was low 50s. And the actions we're taking, again, to reduce capital and reduce costs, which are right on track with our guidance and are going very well. Everything else held constant, that would take our breakeven into the 40s. But not everything else is held constant. In particular, downstream and chemicals, we\u2019ve talked about weaker margins and lower -- much lower volume. So we'll have to see as that shakes out. But as the downstream stabilizes over time, then those reductions should flow through to a lower breakeven. We talked about Permian being free cash flow positive at strip pricing. So this year, in the Permian -- and remember, we had that also as guidance in our Investor Day. It was at a much higher investment level as we run a different trajectory. But even now, this investment level and all the changes that are going on, we affirm that we'll still be free cash flow positive. But that was only specific to the Permian, and that was at strip pricing. If we go to trading, we don't disclose our trading earnings separately. I wouldn't exactly characterize our trading organization the way you said. But we've been pretty clear that the priorities for the trading organization are flow -- ensuring the flow of our upstream barrels and in and out of our refineries, to optimize around those positions and then to trade. And, certainly, at times in the quarter, the market had steep contango, which created trading opportunities for our organization. And you'll see those results in the upstream and downstream segments this quarter and in future quarters.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. Thanks. So apologies for misunderstanding. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeanine Wai at Barclays. \nJeanine Wai: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nPierre Breber: Good morning, Jeanine.\nJeanine Wai: Good morning. My first question is on the overall business. And, I guess, understanding that growth is an output of capital allocation decision. You're working really hard to materially reduce the cost structure. Is there an opportunity for Chevron to meet the prior ROCE and 3% CAGR targets that you laid out at the analyst meeting at a Brent price below the former $60 that you talked about? Or are those targets just kind of no longer the right way to think about the business, given your updated view on macro? I know you just mentioned that you were planning for lower for longer.\nPierre Breber: Well, let me start and Jay might want to add. I mean, yes, certainly, the ability to deliver that kind of production volume is there, because all of the resource and the opportunities, whether it's in the Permian, whether it's the other opportunities we showed during our Investor Day, they are all there. Now there's no doubt, we had our Investor Day on March 3. And by that weekend, and we showed a $60 Brent nominal flat pricing for five years, which everyone agreed was a reasonable assumption, I think. And by the weekend, oil was in the 30s, and the Russian savvy agreement fell apart. And then a few weeks later, we were in a massive economic contraction. So there's no doubt that the world has changed from that Investor Day, and we're in the middle of our planning process, and we'll provide revised updated guidance. But our ability to deliver that kind of production is absolutely there. The question will be, is that still the right strategy? I think we have to step back and look at a sector that is underperforming the broader equity markets. And we're underperforming primarily because of low returns and a lack of capital discipline. So when you hear us talk about capital discipline in our organic portfolio and the actions that Jay is taking to be disciplined with our capital and in our downstream, too, being disciplined around the capital to approach the energy transition to Devin's question, we have to do that in a disciplined way. And then organically, inorganically, we have to be disciplined with capital. The only way to increase returns and regain favor with investors, it's not by outgrowing and is not by having capital flowing back into opportunities. It's by being very disciplined and generating high returns by being really ruthless in our allocation. So I think that's all the way to say is we're going to revise our plans. All the opportunities are there. Whether that's the most optimal outlook going forward, we'll decide. But our commitment to capital discipline, our commitment to raising returns is going to continue, and it's essential for us to be able to deliver higher returns over time.\nJay Johnson: Yes. I think to build on that, we were -- we had very strong performance last year and coming into this. But well before the COVID crisis hit, we had already embarked on a transformation effort, and that transformation effort was all encompassing. It covers every aspect of the company. And it's really built on trying to better integrate technology into our operations and our workflows, making sure that we're as efficient as we can be across our organizations, how do we provide technical services to our business units. In the upstream, we reduced from four to three regions. That went into effect July 1. We've reduced one to two layers across our organization. We're building on that geographic-based business unit in the upstream, which has served us so well, but we're adding in asset class coordination across business units. So we can better team and perform across business unit boundaries, geographic boundaries and segment boundaries. And we've also added in additional focus on value chains and making sure that we're getting the highest realization for our upstream products that we can all the way through the value. So the transformation itself, while it involves some restructuring, I think some of the biggest impact that's going to come is around how we think about the business, the financial fluency that we're getting throughout our workforce to focus on improving returns and understanding where the gaps are between what's possible and where we are today as well as incorporating, as Pierre said, the lower-for-longer mentality, the lower activity levels, lower turnaround activity and some of the other effects that we're seeing. So as you put all this together, I think we'll continue to see not only the commitments towards lowering our cost structure, but I do think we're going to find ways to continue to drive for that aspiration of improving returns.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Great. Thank you -- answer. Yes. My follow-up is kind of a similar question but on the Permian. In terms of just looking medium and longer term and on the efficiency improvements that you mentioned, before you've mentioned that Chevron can grow the Permian to about 1.2 million barrels a day at $4 billion to $5 billion of your CapEx. I know that's a ways off. But beyond the drilling efficiencies that you mentioned and assuming there's a recovery in demand, how material could some of these efficiency improvements be that you've mentioned? Meaning, specifically, based on what you've seen, do you think you could deliver the same or similar productive capacity of that 1.2 million a day but on materially lower CapEx? \nJay Johnson: Yes, Jeanine. I think, we're poised to continue to drive increased efficiency throughout the Permian operations. The drilling is just one example where we're seeing that efficiency, but the advances in technology, the advances in our understanding of the reservoirs and how to best complete and produce from those. The integration of our operation centers, the maintenance, the operations are all driving efficiency. While the near-term activity levels, we've changed those because we can and because we think it's prudent, given the current environment that we find ourselves in, the underlying long-term value and even mid-term value of this asset is unchanged. And I'm actually really excited about the changes that we're making and how we are working together in the organization. And so I do expect to see us be able to deliver on previous expectations and continue to deliver on becoming a more efficient, more effective operator in the Permian Basin. Thanks, Jeanine.\nJeanine Wai: Thank you. \nOperator: We'll go next to Paul Cheng at Scotiabank. \nPaul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nJay Johnson: Good morning, Paul. \nPaul Cheng: I have two questions. I think one for Jay, one for Pierre. Jay, you mentioned about the problem in Gorgon. It's a bit surprising, given it's a new machine. I mean, the feed has only come on stream for, say, less than five years and that you have this problem. So is the problem? Is a design issue or that is just poor workmanship? And also whether the same vendor is applying those to the Train 1 and Train 3 as well as Wheatstone? And if they are, have you already did some inspection on those units? \nJay Johnson: Yes, Paul. So the defects that we found in the wells, we believe were there from the original manufacturer. They're not a design defect at all, but they are a manufacturing defect. They were discovered in train 2, when we took train 2 down for its first major turnaround and inspection. And as I said, as part of the routine inspection, that's when we encountered this particular issue. We are evaluating based on the learnings that we've got how to best address Trains 1 and 3. And we put additional mitigations in place until that's been accomplished. We do not have the same manufacturer for the vessels in Wheatstone. It's a different manufacturer, and I don't expect to see the same issue replicated there. \nPaul Cheng: And Jay, train 1 and train 3 already went through the full turnaround recently, right, just in the last year or two? \nJay Johnson: No. Train 1 went through the turnaround last year. Train 3 is scheduled for next year. \nPaul Cheng: So that's a risk. Yes, Train 3 is more of the risk than Train 1 then because I assume that if there's an issue, when you went through the turnaround in train 1 you should have already discovered? \nJay Johnson: We did not see the issue in Train 1, but we're assessing whether or not we need to reevaluate that inspection and go through it again. And we are addressing how best to inspect and if necessary, repair Train 3 at this time. \nPaul Cheng: Okay. So Train 3... \nWayne Borduin: Thanks, Paul. Second question? \nPaul Cheng: Sure. Second question is for Pierre. I heard about, say, the improving return is one of the top priority for the company. We appreciate that. But we then hear that, we have conflicting maybe priority because you \u2013 from a cash flow standpoint, you are cutting your CapEx in Permian, and Permian actually is your highest return project, while that you're still investing in Anchor and Tengiz, which is clearly that much lower return comparing to Permian. So how exactly that the company is going to be able to raise your return, when you are not investing at least in the next maybe year or two in the most profitable project? I mean, what steps that you will be able to take?\nJay Johnson: So Paul, one of the things we're doing, as you know, we've been bringing our unit development cost in the deepwater down significantly. Our target is to be below $20 a barrel. Anchor, as we've talked about in the past, opens up new opportunities for us and a new class of deepwater assets. We are pacing the development of Anchor in its most efficient pace. We're not focused on having to bring it on by a certain date, but rather keeping all the different aspects of the project consistent and aligned as we move through the impacts of the COVID crisis. In terms of the Permian, it's simply \u2013 we don't see the point of investing in any assets around the world to bring on new production capacity, when the world is so heavily oversupplied. And so because we have that flexibility, we're exercising that, and we'll continue to look at the current environment, and begin ramping up funding and activities when it's appropriate to do so. And we see a better overall supply-demand balance, better fundamentals for the industry.\nPierre Breber: Yes. Only add to what Jay said, look, we're going to be diversified across different asset classes. We're not going to be a pure-play company, and they're operating on different time frames. And one involves production that comes on in years, and one involves production that comes on in months, and we're making that distinction. So we've been laser-focused on capital that supports long-term value, capital that's adding short-term production has been hit very hard. Thanks, Paul. We appreciate your questions.\nOperator: We'll move next to Roger Read at Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yeah. Thanks, good morning. I guess two things to follow up on. First question for you, Jay, on TCO. Just what do you think the critical \u2013 you mentioned critical path items. What are those in 2020 and 2021 we really ought to keep our eyes on for confidence that the project is coming along as expected? And then I don't know. if the second question is for Pierre or for you. But as you think about your outlook for the Permian unconventional in 2021 to down 6% to 7% when does that become a written-in-stone event versus something that you could tweak and we could see something different?\nJay Johnson: So, the critical path for TCO, FGP project, it really runs through the setting of all the utility modules and the compressor boost facilities for the wellhead pressure management part of the project and getting those fully integrated. And that's where our real focus is. So it's mechanical, electrical and instrumentation work once those modules are set on their foundations. That really represents the main focus. But there's a lot of work as well that has to be maintained in parallel with that to be able to deliver the project as expected. A - Pierre Breber Yeah. And look, on the Permian, we could bring completion crews back very quickly, if that were to happen. So again, it's just \u2013 we're in the middle of our planning process. We'll update our capital budget. But even after we have a capital budget, we can reallocate capital if the world changes. And there's a lot of flexibility in the Permian. It goes back to the earlier question, there's a lot of value there. So we'd want to see the sustained economic recovery, see inventory levels heading down, but it's something that we could change very quickly with -- by adding completion crews and then adding rigs over time. \nA - Jay Johnson: Just as we brought it down, we can take it backup. \nPierre Breber:   Thanks, Roger. \nRoger Read: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Leggate, Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks for squeezing in guys. I just got a couple of quick ones. Pierre, perhaps you could just elaborate on your change of price assumption? And what I'm really looking for is do you anticipate that you will continue to add debt, given you've got substantial headroom as you pointed out last quarter over the foreseeable future? \nPierre Breber: I'm sorry. You broke up a little bit on your question, Doug. Can you say that again? \nDoug Leggate: Yes. So can you hear me now? \nPierre Breber:   Yes. \nDoug Leggate:   Okay. So do you anticipate adding additional debt, given you've still got substantial headroom as you pointed out last quarter? And if you could elaborate, please, on the change on price assumptions that you referred to earlier. \nPierre Breber: Yes. So on the price assumption, I'm not sure I can say much more. We don't disclose our price outlooks. We view it as commercially sensitive. We're obviously in the market at times selling or buying assets, and we wouldn't want our counterparty to know what our price outlook is. We don't think that's in the interest of our shareholders. But again, we lowered our price outlook primarily due to what we think are the likely lower economic activities due to the global pandemic. No one knows what the recovery will look like, but it's clear that there's been an economic contraction, and it will take some time period to recover. And our products are so closely linked to economic activity.  In terms of debt, we had a very successful bond issuance that we did right after last quarter. It was better than any of our peers in terms of the pricing. And we'll continue to monitor the market. We're in a very strong position. Our commercial paper balances are well below levels, very comfortable levels, but we always look at where the market is and what our liquidity is. And we certainly couldn't go to the bond market and do another issuance if we think it's the right thing to do. \nDoug Leggate:   Thanks. My follow-up for Jay real quick. Jay, I hate to get a bit, but your comments about Gorgon, can you just elaborate, is this a true bundle [ph] ahead issue? Or what is the remediation that you're anticipating? I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nA - Jay Johnson: So are you asking about the repair for the vessels? \nDoug Leggate: Yes. I'm just trying to understand the nature of the problem and what remediation, what options you have for remediation? \nA - Jay Johnson: It's really just grinding out and replacing a well that has some abnormalities and ensuring that we have the structural and pressure containing capacity that we're looking for. \nDoug Leggate:   Okay. So no chips under replacement? \nPierre Breber:   Sorry. You're breaking up again, Doug? \nDoug Leggate:   Sorry, no chip bundle replacement required? \nPierre Breber: Replacement required? \nA - Jay Johnson: No, we do not need to replace the vessels. We believe the repairs are going to be fully effective. \nDoug Leggate: Okay. Thanks a lot, pals.\nA - Jay Johnson: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator:   We'll go next to Sam Margolin at Wolfe Research. Sam, you may have your line muted. I'm sorry, Sam, we're not hearing you. You may have the line muted. \nPierre Breber:   Okay. Audra, why don't we go to next question? \nOperator:   Okay. We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada. \nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just had a couple of quick ones. The first one is on TCO. I think, Jay, you mentioned that you used up some of the contingency on timing. But can you talk about how much contingency there is left on cost? And just get a sense around that? And then I have a follow-up on the impairments. Thank you.\nJay Johnson: The efficiencies that we saw in our schedule and the gains that we made on schedule were consistent with also gains we are making on cost. But to really tell you where we are, we're going to have to see how we get through this fourth quarter remobilization and sustaining the workforce. So we'll update cost and schedule probably early next year.\nPierre Breber: And Biraj, we've said about $1 billion less capital this year. A portion of that is deferral, but about half, but a portion is lower currency effects or currency benefits and higher productivity. So we think some of those cost savings are rolling through. It's not all just deferral.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay. Understood. And then maybe one for you, Pierre. On the impairments, alongside the lower commodity prices, did you also adjust your expectations on medium-term refining and chems margins?\nPierre Breber: There are no impairments. They're all upstream related. So yes, we have -- again, we have various outlooks for upstream and downstream and chemicals margin. But the impairments were all upstream related, and they were -- there was no LNG, no refining mill chemicals. And again, Venezuela is the biggest part of it. There was the price-related impacts and then there were some suspended costs that also were written off. \nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay. Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jason Gabelman at Cowen. \nJason Gabelman: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about the downstream business, specifically, U.S. downstream was particularly weak this quarter. I think even attributing all the timing impacts to the U.S. portion of downstream, it still would have missed, I think, what people were expecting. Can you just talk about some of the challenges you're experiencing, particularly in that part of the business? I'm thinking along the lines of maybe your overindexation to the West Coast was a headwind this quarter and the outlook for that part of the business in the near term? And I have a follow-up. \nPierre Breber: Yes. The first thing I'd say is, our execution across upstream and downstream was excellent. I mean, we ran safely and reliably across our upstream and downstream portfolio under very difficult conditions and again extraordinary kind of market conditions. Jason, I referred to our U.S. crude utilization in the second quarter was 55%. Now it's operating higher than that now. Its north of 70% and it's heading towards 80% here in the next couple of weeks. So there were extraordinary contractions. We ran, we matched our supply to our demand. We have sales channels through our retailers and marketers, and we weren't going to -- we were going to meet their demand, but we tried to minimize any build in inventories and try to match, which is very unusual. Obviously, we had to significantly reduce our jet production because the jet reductions were even more significant. So the actual execution we thought was outstanding. It's just -- I don't think the model, frankly, work under the circumstances that we had in the second quarter. We never planned -- I led that business for three years. Nowhere did we ever plan to run at 55% of crude utilization. Nowhere did we plan to make as little jet as we possibly could. So it's really extraordinary conditions. It was all very well executed. But I think when you take the timing effects, margins, which are not entirely transparent across the portfolio. And big volume effect, I think you'll get there. The West Coast, I mean, it just varied. There are times the West Coast was better. There was time the West Coast was worse. I mean, it's -- I wouldn't view it if you look at inventory levels on the West Coast and PADD 5, they're actually below a year ago level. So there was nothing, I think, structural. It was a fast-moving set of circumstances in the second quarter. Different regions were operating at different time periods. Asia, outside the U.S., obviously, held up better in the second quarter. It was more impacted in the first quarter. And that's the kind of nature of operating right now through a global pandemic. And the economic impacts of it.\nJason Gabelman: Sure. Thanks. And then the follow-up, the next kind of large project, I guess, in your Q is once TCO ends are the 2 pet chem crackers that have been proposed within the CPChem JV. I think those were deferred from being FID either late this year or early next year, but the FID was pushed out. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about FID-ing those 2 crackers and your overall thoughts about chemicals demand growth given the pandemic?\nPierre Breber: Yeah. I mean, well, chemicals demand has held up better than our refined products, and demand is flat to maybe even up a little bit. So there's been some mix effects. Some things are up, some things are down. But overall, pet chem demand has held up pretty well. But as you know, even pre-COVID, margins are weak. There's been a lot of supply at it. So I'll just keep going to capital discipline. And that's really the key for the company and for the industry. It's not just the demand side. We've got to look at the supply side. So we have very competitive projects. They are on the low end of the cost curve. In other words, they can compete, better than almost -- than most others, right? They have very advanced feedstocks. We believe they'll have very low, construction costs. But you're right we are pacing and deferring those decisions, until we get more clarity. We like the business long-term. We'd like to invest in it long-term. But we just have to see where the economy goes and really where industry players go in terms of how disciplined everyone will be about capital investments going forward.\nJason Gabelman: Great. Thanks for the time.\nWayne Borduin: I'd like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Audra, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-05-01 18:01:54", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I wound now turn the conference call over to your host for today\u2019s program, the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead.\nWayne Borduin: Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other Forward-Looking Statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Wirth: Alright. Thanks, Wayne. Before we get started, I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. Our thoughts are with all the families affected by COVID-19 and especially with the healthcare workers on the frontlines battling everyday to contain the outbreak. I\u2019m also incredibly grateful to our employees who show up every day, particularly those out in the field, operating critical facilities to provide the energy that supports the pandemic response and keeps essential goods and services flowing in support of the economy. They too, are heroes. During our security analysts meeting in March, we discussed Chevron\u2019s resilience. And now it is time for us to demonstrate it. No one foresaw these specific market conditions, but we were prepared for them. We know what to do, and we are doing it as we execute this five point action plan. First and foremost, we are focused on the safety of our employees and our operations. Next, we are exercising the flexibility in our capital program. Today, we are further lowering our full-year guidance. In addition to capital costs always matter in a commodity business. We initiated a major company restructuring last year, and we expect to drive additional savings this year and next. Capital structure also matters. We came into this crisis with an industry leading balance sheet, and we are taking actions intended to maintain financial strength. Lastly, while addressing current market conditions, we are preserving long-term value for shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. I will speak to each element of this action plan in the following slides beginning with safe and reliable operations on Slide 4. We have had fewer than 50 confirmed cases of employees with the virus and nearly all cases appear to have been contracted outside the workplace. Most of our office based employees are able to work-from-home. For those who continue working at facilities or in the field, we have implemented multi-layer screening, distancing, hygiene and PPE protocols. Our COVID-19 testing capability is ramping up. Finally, we are helping our communities with donations of money, PPE and other things we can manufacture like sanitizers in our plants and 3D printed face shields.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Mike. Turning to Slide 10. First quarter earnings were $3.6 billion, or $1.93 per share. Adjusted earnings, which excludes special items in foreign exchange were $2.4 billion, or $1.29 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations was $4.7 billion and total capital spending was $4.4 billion. In the quarter, we also increased our dividend and repurchased $1.75 billion of shares, before suspending the share repurchase program. Turning into cash flow. Excluding working capital, cash flow from operations covered the dividend and cash CapEx and the first quarter, yielding a dividend breakeven under $50 brand. Proceeds from the sales of our interest in Malampaya were offset by loans to TCL. Given volatile market conditions, we are holding more cash and ended the quarter with a net debt ratio of 14%. \nWayne Borduin : Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue. So please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines.\nOperator: Certainly. . Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan.\nPhil Gresh: So first question here just as we look at that slide really talking about the $30 oil case. And the funding of the dividend, the priority of the dividend and adding debt to cover capital spending. At the end of that period, do you have a sense of\u2026\nMichael Wirth: Phil, you cut out, right. When you said at the end of that period, do you have a sense of.\nOperator: Mr. Gresh, we are not hearing you right now. I\u2019m not sure if it is your connection your phone.\nMichael Wirth: Okay. Jonathan, we can move on to the next question. If he go back and if we can clarify that we got a good connection with him.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nDevin McDermott: I wasn\u2019t on mute, but there, but it seems like it wasn\u2019t going through it. If you hear me now with the, I will try to pick up where I think Phil left of on the stress test for $30 Brent. When we think about where this the stress test takes you from a leverage standpoint, or debt to capital standpoint over that two-year period. He talked a little bit about where you would end up at the end of 2021 And also where you would comfortable in terms of taking leverage to and what\u2026\nMichael Wirth: Yes, we I think we got the essence of it, which is where do you end up at the end of 2021 and how comfortable are you there as Pierre Breber do you want to respond to that?\nPierre Breber: Yes. So, thanks for the question. Look, the chart on the left gives an indication of the negative cash flow that we expect under a stress test at $30 Brent, and then the chart on the right shows our debt position relative to peers and relative to the zero line which has a net debt ratio of 25%. And when you put the two together, where the negative cash flow or that incremental debt, it keeps us - we are still to the right of that zero line. So, in other words, we can have two years at $30 Brent, invest in the business, sustain our dividend and still exit at the end of 2021 with a net debt ratio less than 25%, which we think is still a very strong balance sheet.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, I might just add Devin. We are protecting the dividends because we are set up to do so and we have made it a priority. As Pierre said, we enter with balance sheet strength that is second to none, and advantaged portfolio with a low breakeven capital discipline. That is part of our DNA. We have demonstrated it through the way we have managed capital spending, our discipline on transactions and we have got capital flexibility. And all of this is because we are committed to the dividend and you can see that while we do lean on the balance sheet to fund the capital program, over this period of time, we can support the dividend comfortably and still remain in a very healthy position and we have set ourselves up to do so. Thanks, Devin, did you have a follow-up?\nDevin McDermott: Yes. So, a follow-up just on the on the capital spending side building down a little bit. So, you talked a little bit about how you think about the tradeoff between some of the near-term cuts in capital spending, which really skewed more towards short cycle versus one of your priorities of retaining long-term optionality and continue to support longer term growth. So, that preservation of long-term value point. So, how do you think about that trade off and also how much additional flexibility if any is there as you look at the budget where it stands today?\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Devin. So, a few years ago, we really had a budget that was skewed towards the long-term, end of the spectrum, and we have consciously shifted that now to have the short-term weighting much higher within our portfolio, because it gives us the flexibility that you talked about and it is underpinned with the longer term projects, but it is not dominated by those. So, we have built a more flexible portfolio that allows us to slow down the short cycle investments when the market signal indicates that those are not being rewarded in the marketplace and yet we are maintaining the ability to ramp those up. And we have a longer term capital projects that are earlier in the phase and we will be very disciplined in bringing those forward. The other thing that is different that is really important is a much larger percentage of our portfolio now is facility limited, versus reservoir limited and characterized by the kinds of declines that you can see in a different portfolio. And that enables us to hold production with more modest capital spend and preserve the cash flow that is associated with that. So, look, we are conscious of things like leases, we are conscious of the way we are developing our resources, but we are trading those things off and when the market is not calling for near-term production, we shouldn\u2019t be investing to deliver it. We should be conserving the cash for another day and that is really how we are balancing this out. Thanks Devin.\nDevin McDermott: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate, Bank of America. Your question please.\nMichael Wirth: Doug, were still challenged here with this audio situation. I\u2019m afraid we are not hearing you. I apologize for this. Jonathan, can we try to\u2026\nPierre Breber: Yes, Jonathan, why don\u2019t we pivot to the next question? The next in the queue.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nNeil Mehta: Alright. Well, thank you. So I guess the first question was around curtailments. And can you walk us through with a little more depth about where they are magnitude? And as we think about production shut-ins, what gives us confidence that there won\u2019t be any structural damage to the assets and we have confidence that supply can return when the market ultimately needs it?\nMichael Wirth: Sure. And so let me just frame it up a little bit, Neil. I was just talking to Devin about balancing cash flow and long-term value and that is certainly a key driver here as we are looking at curtailments. We are trying to avoid the need for abrupt shut ins. So these truly are in broadly speaking curtailments rather than the shut ins, with a very conscious effort to preserve reservoir and well integrity. We do these things for turnarounds for storms and the like. So we know how to do this quite well. And we really don\u2019t expect any issues as we ramp backup. Curtailments in April were relatively modest, as Pierre outlined with the forward guidance May in June look like they could be more significant. About 50/50 between the U.S. and rest of the world. And certainly in the U.S. the Permian and the short cycle piece of it is the predominant part. Around the rest of the world they tends to be related to OPEC and OPEC Plus commitments in the way those are translating into local conditions. But we are very cognizant of where and how we slow production and expect to be able to return production when the market changes in relatively short order without putting reservoir well integrity at risk.\nNeil Mehta: We see that you put a pause on the project or at least slow down spending. So, can we do a status check of how far you have gotten so far, and how it is progressing? What the ultimate plan is around execution from here, and in any early thoughts on what that slowdown could mean for the full project budget?\nMichael Wirth: Sure. So the project is about 75% complete right now Neil, construction 56 or so percent. Logistics are working very well, as I said, there are only seven modules left in Korea and all of those will have departed by the end of this quarter. We have got a number on the water, additional ones at the transshipment locations and some moving through the waterways. So the logistics are moving quite well. Since late 2019, we have got all of the pipe racks and the gas turbine generators and utility modules on foundation and we continue to work on the critical path. Locally, I mentioned we have seen COVID cases in a number of the camps, there is over 100 different residential camps there. And as a result, we are de mobilizing non-essential staff to minimize the risk of spread. That means we are de mobilizing about 17,000 people to 20 different locations. Most of these are contractors, not employees of TCO. But we are helping to manage the logistics. We are moving people back to other parts of Kazakhstan, Turkey, Russia, Singapore, the UK. We need to provide context tracing information for everybody who demobilizes, we have converted a fire station and a - test center. We are testing 1,500 people a day. We have got 29 nurses there working around the clock. So a very thoughtful effort on how we demobilize. The people that are remaining are working, in essence under a pod strategy where workforce is isolated by shift and by crew. We have got boxed meals, digital permits. We have got dedicated drivers and cleaners and things to really reduce the risk employees are all outfitted in proper PPE and alike. We actually are maintaining pretty good schedule progress on the critical path, in spite of all of this, which allows us to focus the workforce on critical path. And to demobilize, some of the non-critical path activity. Our power and control work, the gathering system, the sour gas injection system are all several months ahead of the critical path. And that enables us to slow down and mitigate some of these risks. The biggest challenges are in the area of crew changes. So we have people working on some extended rotations, transit in and out in the labyrinth of travel restrictions of each level cities, countries, et cetera is something we are managing aggressively and carefully. We are testing people as they arrive to minimize quarantine on arrival. So a very focus and thus far, I would say a very successful effort to respond to this. The main focus is on the pressure boost facility and the utilities in the processing plant, which are on the critical path. In terms of the actual reduction in C&E, our share a about a billion dollars, about half of that is deferral of activity. About a third of that is mitigation of cost growth through aggressive creative measures. And the balance is really related to foreign exchange. So hopefully that gives you a sense of where we are, and certainly, as we go forward on every call, we will know more, we will see how things have unfolded there, and we will provide you additional information as we have it.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from line Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Your question please.\nJeanine Wai: So, my first question now that you can hear me is on sustaining CapEx. And we know, Mike, that you don\u2019t really talk about sustaining CapEx on a one year basis at all. But can you comment on whether the new 12 billion annualized CapEx run rate is enough to maintain what you would consider acceptable reserve replacement ratio over a longer term period and whether this can also allow you to achieve your corporate objectives of increasing RSE, shareholder returns and all that, but maybe at a different rate from what you thought before?\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Jeanine, you are correct. This really isn\u2019t a way that we think about the business, it is not something we rely on or plan around to measure the business. So, it is not an simple question to answer, because it is just not how we think about things. We do understand it is a question among some in the investment community, Pierre has been thinking about how to try to help you guys understand this a little bit better and translate from how we run the business to how these questions come in. So Pierre, maybe you can help Jeanine with that.\nPierre Breber: Yes. Thanks, Jeanine. And as Mike says, we don\u2019t think about the business that way and to the earlier question. We are not sustaining short-term production, right that is a very deliberate choice. Mike talked about that the price signal says we don\u2019t need a short-term production, and we are prioritizing capital on long-term value. So, again if sustaining short-term production is part of the definition, then it is just not how we manage the business as we are trying to balance the short-term and the long-term. But if we think of sustaining capital as kind of an analytical construct, that is really the capital to keep upstream production capacity flat from existing fields for a number of years, and so in that definition, I would exclude exploration, I would exclude capital to develop new fields or for expansions like into in 10 GIS, I would exclude assets that are sold or contracts that are going to expire and I would exclude downstream and chemicals. And so if you if you go through that, and we talked about 11 billion for upstream based business and shale and tight total capital, and that results in some growth, about 10 billion would be a reasonable estimate of the capital to keep that production capacity flat from existing fields for a number of years. Again, we are below that right now. Right, we started with bass and shale and tied at 11. If you roll through the reductions will be under eight. So, again, short-term production we do not expect to be sustained at your kind of notional $12 billion capital which includes downstream and chemicals with some cuts and exploration, but long-term value is preserved. Thanks Jeanine.\nMichael Wirth: Did you have a follow up Jeanine?\nPierre Breber: No.\nMichael Wirth: Okay, fine. Next question.\nOperator: Alright. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotia Bank. Your question please.\nMichael Wirth: We will be patient here, because it seems like it takes 15 or 20 seconds for this to start. So Paul, hang in there and we are waiting on you.\nPaul Cheng: I think since that potentially that we will cut off, so I would ask both questions. I think the first one Mike, not that you will have a target now, but that the sector is being compressed and a lot of your peers is under distress. If there is a one view, how much is the balance sheet you are willing to risk in this current moment for the right deal at all?  And the second question, may as well that ask that first, in case I get cut off. This is for Pierre. You have a strong balance sheet, but it looks like you are going to have a substantial cash burn for this year, next year, and three depressed pricing in the moment that we see. You raise some debt, but you make sense for you, given the debt market has actually open and the cost is quite low for you at this point to raise even more debt to pre-fund the potential cash burn or that you think the commercial market is with available and you don\u2019t need to do that?\nMichael Wirth: Okay, yes, Paul, you are an experienced multi part questioner. So I think that was good to get both of those in. Let me let me give you a quick response and then Pierre, I\u2019m sure will have some thoughts he would like to add there. The reason we showed this low prices stress test Paul was to give you a sense that we really can endure a couple of years of really tough pricing, and our gearing would move back to a level that is not an uncomfortable level to be at. In fact, Pierre said frequently, that overtime we would anticipate moving our gearing back into the kind of 20% to 25% range. Anyway, now this isn\u2019t necessarily the way we thought we would get there. But that is not an uncomfortable place for us to be. So leaning on the balance sheet through this period of time is something that is very doable that will maintain a strong credit rating as we do that. And so we are certainly willing to go there. And as you know, in years gone by you go back a few years ago, our gearing was above that 25%. And so I think we are in a range that we have demonstrated, we can manage, and we know how to. In terms of going to debt markets at low cost, I do think that it is prudent to look at that. And debt is attractively priced right now, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for us to look to add to that. So Pierre, maybe you can comment on that. \nPierre Breber: Yes, I think there was an M&A question to there about using our balance sheet for M&A. But that I think I can just address. You can also use equity as part of a transaction, so we don\u2019t view the balance sheet as the only means to do M&A, because equity makes sense in an oil deal where there is price risk and obviously price volatility and you wouldn\u2019t want a winner and loser between the buyer and the seller on an M&A deal. In terms of, I think Mike address the debt question. I mean, as we consume cash, we will lengthen the maturities, we will look at when there is a good window to approach the bond markets. We do have access to a lot of commercial paper that was shown on the liquidity side. Commercial paper still remains, the lowest cost and the most flexible source of funding for us, but under these kinds of conditions, and if the conditions persist, we would want to have some more longer term debt that would be appropriate. And I think as Mike said, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if you see us approach the market.\nMichael Wirth: Thanks Paul. I\u2019m sorry, I missed the M&A angle on your first question. Okay, let us go to next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question please.\nPierre Breber: Hang in there, Paul, for some reason, we are still working through the delay. Paul, we are ready for your question.\nPaul Sankey: Hello, can you hear me?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. We have got you, Paul.\nPaul Sankey: The question is, how is the world changed for you post this thing? Obviously, we can see the future strippers is pressured for 2021. And I think you have addressed that a little bit. I think it is clear that your mega projects Australia, Kazakhstan sort of continue as they were, and ultimately have very low breakevens when they are running. I guess the question would be, firstly on the Gulf of Mexico is the world do you think different there. And most importantly, obviously, for your Company, we know that you wanted to buy Anadarko for the acreage in the Permian. How do you think that the world has changed with regards to the Permian given what is happening? Thank you.\nMichael Wirth: Okay. thank you Paul. Well, I think when you are in the depth of something as unprecedented as this. It is hard to say exactly how the world will change on the other side of it. And as much as it feels like this has been going on for a long time. We are really just a couple of months into it. And so I think on the other side of it, I\u2019m an optimist. I have great confidence with all the resources being dedicated to vaccine development and therapeutics and testing capacity. I\u2019m an optimist that in time the health risks will be successfully mitigated and managed. I believe that the world will return to some post Corona Virus form of normal and that means economic activity. It means growth, it means travel. The pace and the patterns at which that reemerge is I think are still open to a wide range of views and I don\u2019t know that anybody can predict that exactly. But when you translate that back to our industry, I think it plays into some things that we have long believes, which is low cost of supply matters. Operational excellence and discipline in project execution matters, capital, discipline matters, cost, discipline matters. And all of those things will become very apparent as we recover in some form with inventory length in the market with OPEC production off and with the opportunity for shale and tight to come back in relatively rapidly. And so I think, the term lower for longer has been used for a while to describe conditions. I think that is even more appropriate today than it has been in past times when it is been used. I think we need to be very focused on an efficient use of every one of our resources to operate well and to drive the cost of supplies down in a world that looks like it will be pretty well supplied. So, you get to the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico has been resetting its cost structure to compete in a world like this. I think it means we have got more work to do to make the Gulf of Mexico compete even more, more focus on tiebacks, infill drilling, utilizing existing infrastructure and finding efficient ways to develop in the Gulf of Mexico and so that trend is one that we need to stay on. We have made a lot of progress and I think there is more work to be done there. In the Permian, our we are not done improving in the Permian. Our results, even as we sit here today, continue to improve and so well costs come down, drilling efficiency improves, completion, design and execution improves, and the hydrocarbons haven\u2019t gone away the rocks don\u2019t go bankrupt, and companies might but the rocks won\u2019t. And I think that that is a resource that will continue to be very important in the overall supply picture and certainly, it will be for our company. And so we will look to invest in the very best projects, we will look to acquire assets and opportunities, be they through exploration or other means that will compete in our portfolio and continue to be attractive in a world where low cost of supply and the ability to generate good returns matters. So, in some ways, those fundamentals are only more important going forward than they have been Paul and beyond that. I think it is speculation on a lot of the other things you hear people talking about.\nPierre Breber: Okay, so we are going to pull an audible here. I have actually got Doug Leggett\u2019s questions keyed up, he had trouble dialing back in, so he texted me his questions, Mike. I\u2019m going to feed them to you that way. So, the first one was for Mike shale thinks the whole industry needs a reset a change in long term supply et cetera. They just cut the dividend to adapt. What do you think of the big picture at this point? And then the second one will be for Pierre.\nMichael Wirth: Okay, look, I think everybody is - it is interesting, Doug and apologies we couldn\u2019t get you on the phone directly here. I wish we could have the conversation directly. I think we have actually seen more of a divergence in strategies and thinking among companies in our industry over the last few years, and we haven\u2019t a long time. And everybody\u2019s got a slightly different take on where they are going and where their strengths are. And so I can\u2019t speak for another company. I will just tell you, it is very similar to what I was saying in response to Paul Sankey question. I think the companies that can be reliable efficient low cost providers will continue to have a very strong position as leaders in our industry. And the world is not ready to transition to another source of energy in large part anytime soon. And so the resumption of economic growth will require the sources of energy that we know today and that fuel the world today. And there will be a need for what we do. And I think you have to be very honest with yourself about where you are going and where you are not. And you have got to focus on improving in closing gaps where you need to improve and getting even better where you have strengths. So, again, it kind of gets back to the fundamentals, capital discipline, cost discipline, project execution, and the ability. And I would say it, if we haven\u2019t said it clearly enough. Your balance sheet is a great asset. And oftentimes we think of our upstream or downstream assets as the most important asset and they are very, very important in our business. The balance sheet is also a very important asset, you have to treat it with a priority, you have to be prepared for the day when you need to rely on that asset, and I think that also becomes very, very important, as we move forward. We have been prudent in the way we have managed that, we were positioned differently than others as we went into this. And I think you can see, as I said, while we wouldn\u2019t have predicted this exact market scenario, we were prepared for an environment like this. And we will navigate our way through it with our shareholders in mind. Second question. \nPierre Breber: Yes. Second question is around cash CapEx, of the $14 billion guide, how much of that cash CapEx? And how much further can that go down without impeding cash flow in production?  Yes, so again, sorry, Doug, we couldn\u2019t get you on. So that 9.3 billion is the cash CapEx equivalent to 14. So it was it was 10.5 at 16. So it went down 1.2 of the 2 billion additional reduction is in cash capital. I think Mike has addressed that I addressed it with sustaining CapEx. Again at the CapEx levels into Jeanine\u2019s question when we are at $12 billion, when you back out, reduced downstream and exploration, we are below the level to sustain short-term production. And again, that is a deliberate decision, because there is not a lot of value in putting capital that results in production at current prices. We are investing and I should have said to Jeanine\u2019s answer, although we are below the $10 billion let\u2019s call sustaining capital on bass and shale and tight which will cause some decline. We are investing in TCO, FGP/WPMP which will come on in 2022 and 2023 and provides that kind of long-term value. So again, the choices that Mike and the leadership team are making are really balancing the short-term and the long-term and being thoughtful about where the capital reductions are and where the capital investments are.\nMichael Wirth: Thanks, Doug, for your questions. Jonathan, we will pick the next one in the queue.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. Along the lines of what you said about the energy transition you know not being as realistic perhaps as what a lot of folks are saying. Your CO2 targets assumed pre-COVID production rate, given that across the board volumes will be coming down. Are you looking to upsize those decarburization targets that you put out last summer?\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Pavel, it is interesting. Everybody in the industry has defined their targets just a little bit differently. And we haven\u2019t actually put out absolute targets, which you would expect absolute greenhouse gas emissions to come down if people are restricting activity. We put out intensity targets. So a greenhouse gas emissions per unit of production. We had a target for per barrel of oil in the upstream we had a target performance for gas production. And then we have got flaring and methane emission targets. All of which are unit targets that drive down unit emissions. And so we have not reset those, we would expect that we will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, irrespective of COVID or any of these other circumstances, these are commitments we have made, we have tied people\u2019s compensation to them. And we intend to continue to reduce our emissions footprint.\nPierre Breber: And just the other add to the other distinction is that we have done it on an equity basis. So whether we operate or don\u2019t operate our whole, all the barrels or all the MCS are in those intensity metrics that Mike talked about, not just our operated barrels.\nPavel Molchanov: Alan, if I may. Is there any change in the historical linkage between Asian LNG prices and Brent crude given what is happened in the last 60-days?\nMichael Wirth: Probably contracts have not changed and of course, we sell most of our volume on contract. Our contracts typically are linked to not linked to Brent directly, but linked to JCC or Japanese crude cocktail is another one is linked to a JKM index, which is a gas related index. So I think commodity prices, have some sympathetic relationship with one another, but they are not always perfectly correlated. And so I think you would certainly say that our crude linked contracts will reflect crude prices. And to the extent Brent has come off, eventually our accrued linked contracts will reflect that, they tend to be on a lag basis. And so they don\u2019t always reflect current month pricing. But broadly speaking, yes, you will see a connection between those two.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore.\nDoug Terreson: Good morning everybody. Mike, you guys were an early and a power adopter of the discipline capital management model and that is obviously serve your shareholders well during the upturn, and now the downturn too. So first, kudos to you guys for that. And then to the points about industry stress I think Paul brought up earlier, which often lead to consolidation. My question is well, financial benefits are often available on a variety of transactions, strategic benefits on the scale that you guys received from Golf and Texaco and Unocal back in the day, may or may or may not be this time around. And so I want to see if you find a strategic condition today. How you think it is similar or different from prior downturns given your history. And also any other notable color or philosophy that that you want to share on this topic?\nMichael Wirth: So, I guess if you go back, all the way to Golf. And that takes you back to the 80s. The industry was highly fragmented even amongst the largest players. And so there were, as you say, financial benefit of consolidation and there were strategic benefits as you brought together portfolios that had that had gaps in them. And we certainly saw that with Gulf, we saw it again with Texaco, I think today we have got fewer large players and so the impact of any single transaction that is not amongst large players, and those are pretty hard to do as you get down to small numbers. They are less profound both from a financial standpoint simply because you are you don\u2019t have the same scale that you are consolidating and it flows through to the asset portfolios. And so that the players that like ourselves in our big peers have exposure to many basins around the world to all segments of the value chain. And I think everybody has worked to try to optimize their portfolios in a way that I think fits with their strategy. And so I think your point is a good one you can do kind of rifle shots, that would be maybe smaller bore both on the financial and the strategic dimension that could fill in nicely. But things that would be transformative the way we saw back around the 99 and 2000 period. I think you are right. I think that is a lot harder to envision today. Everybody\u2019s become more efficient and so even the synergies that, that we saw back then, our technology was different information technology was different, our productivity was different and so I think competition has made everybody sharper and more efficient financial synergies are harder to capture.\nDoug Terreson: Okay. Thanks for the color Mike.\nMichael Wirth: Okay Dough. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC. Your question please.\nBiraj Borkhataria: So, I will get my two questions just in case. But um, the first one is on the Permian and shut-ins driven by economics. So, I guess you mentioned that 50% of the curtailment is in the U.S. and then most of that is the Permian. I was wondering if you could talk about the process on how you got to the number you are looking to curtail and why that is the appropriate number for the environment. You see, that would be the first question. And then second question is on the on your CapEx reduction. Obviously, part of this is economics, but there is another element which is not necessarily choice. So, you mentioned slowing down and then 10 GIS. I was wondering if there is an element of the CapEx or quantify the element of CapEx that is simply CapEx that you couldn\u2019t spend even if you wanted to for logistical reasons or otherwise, just trying to get a sense of that would be helpful?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. Okay. Well on Permian curtailment. We have said we have pulled capital down significantly so we are not putting capital into bring new production online and as you are looking at flowing production, not every barrel is created equally we have got we have got some older vertical wells, for instance, that, that in this kind of an environment have pretty marginal economics, we would look at those. We have got barrels that have a different oil gas ratio, we would look at that, we look at net backs logistics and value chain cash flow, storage cost future prices, a whole host of things and then as I mentioned earlier the desire to avoid a future need for abrupt shut ins if we receive logistics and flow curtailed. So there are a series of things that we have got a team looking at across the entire basin, and factoring into decisions that we think are prudent decisions from a value standpoint and an operating standpoint, and it is a moving target. We, actually this is something that our senior leadership team is involved in multiple times a week. And so the models to do this to understand markets and to stay really in touch with markets, to be sure we are making good decisions continue to be informed by new information and so it is a very dynamic process that we are engaged in right now.  On the capital side on the kind of nondiscretionary non our choice capital Pierre can you take?\nPierre Breber: Yes, I think the vast majority are our decisions and choices we are making. But it gets into how you define it, for example, it can gives, we are choosing to demob the noncritical path, project personnel. But clearly that is, that is COVID related. So I don\u2019t know, if you call that a choice. We have a crisis management team that is overseeing supply chains and the whole system. But the bottom line is the vast majority, our decisions that we are making. In some cases with partners we are seeing in almost all cases, partners are very aligned on actions that we are taking.  Now we do have some currency effects, right, so the dollar is stronger. So there is part of the capital reduction. It is also very modest. That is a reflection of currency effects. But I would look at the vast majority of the 30% reduction as being choices that we are making to flex capital, pace capital, defer capital that is largely driven by our decisions to balance cash flow and long-term value. Thanks Biraj.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Jason, your line is open. You might have your phone on mute. And we are still not hearing you.\nMichael Wirth: Okay, I guess we see. It looks like maybe he\u2019s dropped off. Okay. Let\u2019s go to the next question, Jonathan.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from line Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: So I will ask sort of a focus question. We have gone over a lot of high level stuff. But, because your downstream footprint, I\u2019m pretty good look into Asia. Some other operators have been talking about some interesting observations they have made about, the timing disparity between Asia emerging from COVID crisis versus the rest of the world and kind of using it as maybe a soft proxy around the slope that demand might recover or what that might look like on the other side of this. Could you share whatever observations or thoughts you have around what you are seeing?\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Sam, it is a great quote from  Asia is a figment of the Western imagination. He said it was more of a cultural quote, but it is a big area is the reason I bring that up. And what is happening in China is different than what is happening in Indonesia right now. And what is happening in South Korea is different than what is happening in Thailand. And so, broadly speaking, I would say, Asia and other parts of the world, it would appear the demand has found a bottom and that we are kind of bumping along the bottom right now.  And the biggest hit has been on aviation fuels. And then you have got gasoline, which is off 50% give or take around most of the world\u2019s diesel, more like 25%. And so these numbers generally hold in most of the places where we are doing business right now. And then you have regional signals and signs that things are starting to move. China clearly has come off the bottom. Some other markets in Asia that have seen kind of a second wave and they have reinstituted some of these lockdown type policies. The green shoots seem to have pulled back a little bit.  So I would say it is highly specific to the market in Asia where you are. But there are certainly signs in a number of markets of a resumption of activity and resumption of demand growth. And they tend to correlate pretty well with when the policies are relaxed, and people can begin to get back to work and start to move around again. And so I think there are small positive signals, we are getting earlier this week where we talked about it being the beginning of the - beginning. I think, it feels like we are finding the bottom right now. And then the path up out of this is likely to be different, in different regions of the world as it ties to the health status in those parts of the world. But I think this quarter, and perhaps next quarter feel like we are about in the as I said, bumping along the bottom and going to begin to emerge out of it here at some point over that time. Thanks Sam.\nSam Margolin: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line. Brian Todd from Siemens Energy. Your question please.\nBrian Todd: Great. Good morning everybody. Maybe a couple quick one. The $2 billion of additional CapEx cuts on the fuzzy charts. It looks like it is coming from a kind of spread across all businesses. Any additional color and where the cuts are coming from and in the Permian, I think that the X rate at the end of the year was still the same. So maybe any thoughts and how we think of the trajectory there in the Permian? And then I have follow-up.\nMichael Wirth: So the two billion. Broadly, you can take about a little bit less than a billion coming out of a major capital project. And that is primarily TCO. So we had already factored in a little bit of reduction in TCO in the first reduction down to 16, but not nearly as much as we are seeing now. So call it 800 million or so on major capital projects. About half a billion each on unconventional and on other bass business, and the unconventional would include not only Permian, but also Argentina and Canada. And then about another 200 million coming out of downstream and chemicals.  So I think if you take those and wrap them up, that gets you to the, to the two billion. On the Permian, our guidance still is that will exit the year at roughly the level that we came in are 125,000 barrels lower than what we had initially indicated, if you were to look at the chart we use at the Investor Day meeting. And notwithstanding the fact that we are seeing some curtailments there and we are pulling back on the rigs. The momentum coming into the year has been strong in Permian production growth in the first quarter, which largely reflects wells that were put on production last year and we had more pops in the second half of the year than we did in the first half of the year. First quarter Permian production was strong and so that will kick out here over the middle part of the year and come back off as the effects of the capital reductions and curtailments are roll through the system, but our expectation is that we will exit roughly, where we entered, which is about 125,000 less than numbers we showed you in early March.\nBrian Todd: Right. Maybe one. I know there is a huge amount of uncertainty right now is a clear but maybe thought that implications as we think of the recovery coming out of this and in a very specific cents on curtailments. what is the what is the signal is it clearly just is it just a nut bag price that will drive the resumption of those volumes, at least on the ones that you operate and control. And then as we think about the budget, as we move out of the current level of spend and you start to work your way back towards maybe the $20 billion level that we were in before, I mean, how do you what are the sort of signals that you see that will, I guess first allow you to turn on curtailed volumes and then allow you to put rigs back to work and in the Permian?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. So, on the first one on curtailments, I was either going to be market signals or on the economic value of those barrels and net backs will be an important part of that. We will also because we can pull some of these things through the value chain into markets we can what export markets look like what are we have got a refinery that we pull some of our permanent production into. So, refining margins in the value chain opportunities will play into our thinking there as well. So, we look at these things across the entire value chain, but it\u2019ll be an economic signal that says these barrels are being called for by the market and contribution is more positive.  In terms of the capital spending, those are longer cycle decisions than curtailments. And I think you can expect us to be thoughtful and not rush capital back into the market prematurely. But it will be our view on where markets are headed. So, curtailments is kind of more or less where markets are or where they are likely to be in the relative short term. Capital spending is going to be more of a medium term, kind of a view and it is because this flexible asset class, we don\u2019t need to really look at the long term signal we always we always factor that in. But the medium term given the production profile on each individual unconventional we will be looking at signals that suggest that that is strengthening and that the demand is there and you are going to watch OPEC, you are going to watch inventories there is a whole series of indicators. I think that will help us inform decision making there.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Brian.\nBrian Todd: Thank you.\nPierre Breber: With that, I would like to thank everyone for your time today. And we do apologize for some technical and audio challenges, rest assured the transcript will certainly be posted shortly after the call today.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, I appreciate your patience and I apologize for the technical difficulties. I\u2019m not sure what happened, but not only will the transcript be posted, but this will be investigated and corrected.\nPierre Breber: Please stay safe and healthy. Jonathan, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}], "2022": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-01-28 13:46:04", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.\nRoderick Green: Thank you, Jen. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now I will turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Wirth: Thanks, Roderick. After the challenges of 2020, we began last year clear eyed about the economic realities we faced, and at the same time, optimistic about an eventual recovery. By the end of 2021, we had one of our most successful years ever, with return on capital employed approaching 10%, our highest since 2014; the successful integration of Noble Energy, while more than doubling initial synergy estimates; and record free cash flow, 25% greater than our previous high. 2021 was also the year when Chevron accelerated our efforts to advance a lower-carbon future by forming Chevron New Energies, an organization that aims to grow businesses in hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets, introducing a 2050 net-zero aspiration for upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions and establishing a portfolio carbon intensity target that includes Scope 3 emissions and more than tripling our planned lower carbon investments. Chevron is an even better company today than we were just a few years ago. We're showing it through our actions and our performance, which we expect to drive higher returns and lower carbon. And we intend to keep getting better. Our record free cash flow enabled us to strongly address all 4 of our financial priorities in 2021, a higher dividend for the 34th consecutive year, a disciplined capital program, well below budget, significant debt paydown with a year-end net debt ratio comfortably below 20% and another year of share buybacks, our 14th out of the past 18 years. I expect 2022 will be even better for cash returns to shareholders with another dividend increase announced this week and first quarter buybacks projected at the top of our guidance range. We're optimistic about the future, focused on continuing to reward our shareholders while investing to grow our businesses and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We made the most of this challenging period, transforming Chevron through a well-timed acquisition and an enterprise-wide restructuring into a leaner and more productive company. In just 2 years, CapEx was reduced by almost half from Chevron and Noble's pre-COVID total. And operating expenses for the combined company in 2021 were lower than for Chevron on a standalone basis in 2019. The Noble acquisition and increasing capital efficiency enabled us to maintain a 5-year reserve replacement ratio above 100%. And 2021 was very consistent with that longer-term performance, driven primarily by additions in the Permian, Gulf of Mexico and Australia and partly offset by lower reserves in Kazakhstan, mostly due to higher prices and their negative effect on our share of reserves. For more on our strong financial performance, over to Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Mike. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $5.1 billion or $2.63 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.9 billion or $2.56 per share. The quarter's results included 3 special items: asset sale gains of $520 million, primarily on sales of mature conventional assets in the U.S.; losses on the early retirement of debt of $260 million, which will result in significant future interest cost savings; and pension settlement costs of $82 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Full year earnings were over $15 billion, the highest since 2014. Compared with 3Q, adjusted 4Q earnings were down $770 million. Adjusted upstream earnings were flat, with higher realizations offset primarily by negative LNG trading timing effects and higher DD&A. DD&A increased on catch-up depreciation for our interest in North West Shelf, which no longer meets asset held-for-sale criteria and impairments of certain late life assets triggered by updated abandonment estimates. Other items include additional taxes and royalties related to higher prices under certain international contracts. Adjusted downstream earnings were down with lower chemicals margins and volumes at CPChem and GS Caltex in addition to year-end inventory charges. The All Other segment declined due to tax charges. Across all segments, operating expenses increased in part due to higher accruals for employee bonuses and stock-based compensation. Adjusted earnings increased over $15 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased realizations in upstream as well as improved refining and chemicals margins. Costs were up primarily on the acquisition of Noble Energy that closed in 4Q 2020, higher fuel costs and an unfavorable swing in accruals for employee benefits. 2022 production is expected to be flat to down 3% due to expiration of contracts in Indonesia and Thailand. These contracts are not being extended as we were unable to do so in terms competitive with our alternatives. Excluding contract expirations and 2022 asset sales, we expect a 2% to 5% increase in production led by the Permian and lower turnaround activity in TCO in Australia. We reaffirm our prior long-term guidance of a 3% production CAGR through 2025, and we'll share more about our long-term outlook at our upcoming Investor Day. I'll call out a few items on Slide 11. Full year guidance for the All Other segment excludes special items such as pension settlement costs. The All Other segment can vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Affiliate dividends are expected to be between $2 billion and $3 billion, depending primarily on commodity prices and margins. We do not expect any additional lending or loan repayments this year at TCO. Finally, asset sale proceeds are expected to be in line with historical averages. We've updated our price sensitivities to include natural gas. Also, our guidance for both earnings and cash flow sensitivities is now the same as we're likely to consume the remainder of our NOLs and other favorable tax attributes if prices remain higher. Finally, we did not receive our federal income tax refund last quarter and expect it later this year. Back to Mike.\nMichael Wirth: All right. Thanks, Pierre. I believe 2021 was a pivotal year for Chevron, where we got better in so many ways. And we look forward to 2022 and beyond, confident in our strategy and capabilities that aim to deliver higher returns and lower carbon. We'll share more during our Investor Day on March 1. At this time, we expect to be at the New York Stock Exchange with a limited number of participants. The meeting will be webcast for all to see. With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick.\nRoderick Green: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all questions answered. Jen, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: The first question I had was more of a housekeeping item for you, Pierre, which is, in the quarter, it looked like LNG timing effects had a meaningful drag here. I recognize there was a lot of volatility, particularly towards the end of the month with TPS and JKM, but maybe you can break it down in layman's terms for us. What does that really mean and what happened in the quarter?\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Neil. About half of the timing effects in the quarter and first, we're showing a swing between 3Q and 4Q. We had a gain in the third quarter and a negative variance -- a negative absolute amount and a negative swing in fourth quarter. About half of the effects in the quarter were due to a negative inventory charge. So we had 2 cargoes on the water at year-end. They get valued into inventory at average annual prices, which were well below the purchase price because as you said, Neil, prices -- this was a rising price environment and prices rose in the end of the quarter. So that will reverse itself next year when those are -- or this year when they're sold at the higher prices that they purchased at. And then the balance of the timing effects are in paper mark-to-market effects. And as you know, the fit the paper, which is tied to physical cargoes gets marked to market where the physical cargoes are not. And so that creates a timing effect, which unwinds when the physical cargoes are delivered. We ended the year with a positive mark-to-market, but not as positive as what we had at the end of the third quarter. We added some JKM shorts during the quarter to balance our portfolio. We're still net long JKM. So any effects going forward will depend on the direction of future prices. And all this activity is really just geared towards managing our overall price exposure between our sales agreements and our supplies, which are a mix of both Brent and JKM prices. And just to put a fine point on the comment you made, these positions are not very large. But when we have natural gas LNG price movements that have gone from $10 to $20 to $30 an Mcf, it's causing larger timing effects than you would normally see.\nNeil Mehta: That makes a lot of sense, Pierre. And then the follow-up for you is just on cash flow. Again, relative to consensus, it was softer. It does seem like there's some onetimers in there, maybe something around the timing of tax refunds and then where Angola shows up, but there's still a gap in there. So can you just talk about how you bridge to Street numbers in your mind, anything we need to carry forward as we think about next year?\nPierre Breber: Well, I'll cover the 2 points you made. We -- and I mentioned that we did not receive the IRS tax refund that we expected in the fourth quarter, we expect it sometime this year. We did receive a TCO dividend. There is a 15% withholding tax that comes off of the dividend. And we did receive the Angola LNG return of capital. It actually exceeded our guidance. By the way, the TCO dividend was at the high end of our guidance range. And the return of capital from Angola was above our guidance. But again, it shows up in cash from investing and not cash from ops because it's a return of capital. If you look beyond that, we do have, and as I referred to in our prepared remarks, we have certain contracts internationally that have additional taxes and royalties that kick in essentially when oil and LNG prices are higher, and we don't share specifics on our contracts. But as we talked about, we had extraordinarily high LNG pricing of $30, and then we also had oil prices that increase during the year. And then the last thing I'd say is we provided guidance on the third quarter call on our expected increase in earnings from LNG spot cargoes. And we gave that guidance in part because LNG prices increased significantly. And we said we expected to have fewer cargoes because our long-term contract takes were going to be higher during the winter from our primarily Japanese customers. We did not operate -- we didn't produce as much out of Australia, so we had fewer LNG spot cargoes. And again, that was an opportunity missed and that resulted in lower earnings and cash flow.\nMichael Wirth: Neil, it's Mike. The one other thing you talked about what should you bear in mind going forward? As we've been in this fairly depressed commodity price environment, we've built up net operating losses in our business. And as we've returned to profitability, those have now been utilized and offset against taxes payable. As we work our way through those and in a strong price environment that could happen sooner rather than later, we'll be in a net taxable position that's quite different than what we were before as well. And so I think that's another point that may not be as evident in the quarter. But as you go forward, it's kind of a good news/bad news thing, I suppose, we're going to be more profitable, but it also means now we're going to have higher taxes payable.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.\nPhilip Gresh: My first question is on the 2022 production outlook. Obviously, you had an extremely strong Permian production in the fourth quarter. It's about 70,000 barrels a day -- or 80,000 barrels a day, I'm sorry, above the full year average, and you're guiding to 80,000 barrels a day of new production in '22 over '21. So it seems like you can just get there from the Permian alone. But I'm just curious, are there other moving pieces that you should be thinking about on the new production element of the growth for '22? Or is there some conservatism there? Any thoughts would be helpful.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Phil, fourth quarter Permian does look strong. And one thing that we do see from time to time is with our non-operated joint venture position, sometimes the way production gets reported in by partners can result in a little bit of lumpiness in those numbers. But broadly speaking, the Permian is healthy and getting better. I think 2022 Permian production will be a little bit better than we showed at our Investor Day last March. And roughly speaking, up around maybe 10% compared to full year average in 2021. And that is the largest piece of what we would anticipate in terms of production growth next year. There is some growth in base and other primarily. As Pierre said in his comments, we've got lower planned turnaround activity at TCO, and we expect some more uptime at Gorgon. And then that's offset by a few asset sales that we would anticipate. So those are the significant moving pieces in production for 2022.\nPhilip Gresh: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And Mike, I know you'll get in a lot more detail in March at the Analyst Day and looking forward to that. But just kind of looking back pre-COVID at prior analyst days, your framework was 60 Brent that you're using to balance CapEx and distributions in a fairly evenly balanced framework. Obviously, oil is at 90 now and maybe you don't want to give a guidance at those types of levels. But I am curious how you're thinking about what is the right way to look at the cash balancing framework? What price would you think is reasonable these days? As I know you like to manage the business through the cycle, not based on spot prices.\nMichael Wirth: Yes. We will talk about that more in March, Phil. But our longer-term view on the pricing environment hasn't changed a lot. There's a lot of resource out there that can be produced economically at prices lower than what we see today. And our breakeven reflects that. And so we are in a period of time here where cash flow is strong. As we mentioned in our comments, the last 2 quarters have been the best 2 quarters the company has ever seen. And last year was 25% higher than the best year in our history. So we increased the dividend. Debt came down significantly, and we've guided to the high end of our share repurchase range. If we continue to see an environment like this, the balance sheet doesn't need to be a lot stronger than it is today. And we've already increased the dividend and we're going to be disciplined on capital. And so that really leaves one lever left. And I think over time, we're going to -- you should expect us to be consistent with our history, which is returning cash through share repurchases. And at least in an environment like this, we've got ample cash to do that and sustain that well into any kind of a correction that we eventually will see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Our first question is on TCO. I guess now that you're through much of the winter campaign, is there any update on how FGP-WPMP and how those are tracking on cost and schedule maybe given your COVID protocols and efficiencies? And if you have any color on impact related to the recent geopolitical unrest, that would also be very helpful.\nMichael Wirth - CEO: Sure, Jeanine. Fourth quarter was really good execution on field productivity. We made terrific progress and that's carried forward as we began the year. We did have some impact during the unrest that occurred in Kazakhstan, but for about a week is the amount of time that it really cost us in the field there. We've remobilized everyone now and are back at full strength in terms of field activity. And we've got a highly vaccinated workforce, more than 90%. One of the highest rates of vaccination anywhere in our system in the world. And while we have seen Omicron cases appear in the workforce there, at this point, it's at a level that's very well managed, and it's not having any impact on field construction and activity. So we are continuing to make good progress. We have not made any change to our cost or schedule guidance and are overall at about 89% project progress and 82% construction progress at this point. So things have been managed really well on the ground by our team during a pretty challenging month of January.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Great. Good to hear. Our follow-up question or second question, maybe following up on Phil's question on the Permian. It's -- you guys had a really strong quarter, at least also compared to our expectations. You mentioned that 2022 production is a little better than where you thought it was going to be from your March Analyst Day forecast. So just can you clarify, have you accelerated activity there? Or is it really just all based on better efficiencies? And I guess given its importance to corporate growth in the medium term, are you taking any steps related to supplies or labor or equipment in anticipation of some tightening in the service markets over the next couple of years?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. So let me speak first to activity. And then I'm going to let Pierre, who's now in charge of our supply chain organization, by the way, speak to any signs of inflation and how we're managing that. Activity in the Permian is really increasing aligned with the guidance that we've issued previously and spending this year up from $2 billion to $3 billion. Wells put on production, a little bit over 200 we anticipate this year, which is up about 50% versus 2021. And we'll share an update on all of these things when we see you in March. So I would say this is really very well aligned with what we've already guided to and indicated and reflects the ongoing efficiencies that we continue to see in the field and just the quality of this asset, which endures as we go through cycles like the one we just went through. It's really quite nice to have an asset in your portfolio that is this large, that's this flexible when it comes to capital and that we can demobilize, remobilize, not that we would intend to do this frequently, but when conditions call for it, we've been able to exercise that flexibility here over the last couple of years. So strong progress there. And I'll let Pierre comment on input costs.\nPierre Breber: Jeanine, we continue to manage our costs, we think, very well in the Permian and across our portfolio. Our capital budget, which we announced in December, expected some COGS increase, modest in the low single digits. And what we might be seeing a little bit more than that in the Permian, it's very manageable and we think we can offset it with efficiencies. So as we've talked about, although rates are up, they're still below where they were pre-COVID on rigs capacity in the industry for specific oil and gas, equipment and services is still below pre-COVID levels. So whereas we are exposed to labor and steel and certain other elements, cost elements that are tied to the broad-based economy, oil and gas-specific equipment services are still well under control and our ability to contract well, be a very good partner to work with, all gives us confidence that the little bit of cost pressure we're seeing is very manageable within the range of what we expected, and we intend to deliver our capital program in line with our budget.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.\nDouglas Leggate: So Pierre, I think your explanation about the dividend from TCO being a return of capital, I think that probably explains why The Street's cash flow numbers were too high. But my question is really about the go-forward portfolio leverage. So you obviously lose Indonesia, you lose Thailand, which I guess was gas. But you've got the Permian driving growth on a lighter recent history of PSC capital for the cost call standpoint. So my question is when I think about portfolio oil leverage for the go-forward outlook, how does that compare to the legacy portfolio given all those changes?\nPierre Breber: Our guidance on -- let me start by saying we've always been the most levered among the integrated energy companies. That's a function of the portfolio we've created over a long time, which tends to be upstream-weighted. And within upstream, we tend to be oil-weighted. And again, a big portion of our LNG is sold under oil prices. So whereas we were viewed as a defensive stock during some of the challenging times in 2020 and last year because of how we manage the balance sheet and how we're able to flex our capital program and manage our costs, we really are more of an oil play and we're much more levered on the upside. And we've shown that in last Investor Day, and we'll show that again in the upcoming Investor Day. In terms of our sensitivity, I mean, it's still around the same when you factor it all in. I mean, Indonesia was working its way to be a fairly modest portion of the portfolio. You are right over time with both Tengiz and the Permian that increases are weighting in some ways. But the guidance that we provided of $400 million of earnings and cash flow benefit from a dollar change in prices still holds.\nDouglas Leggate: My follow-up, if I may, is to go back to your one-off comments, the DD&A and the -- I guess, the timing effects. I'm just going to ask that the question for a little clarity. On the DD&A, it looks like there was some catch-up. What is -- how much was that because you didn't strip it out? I'm curious why you didn't strip it out. And then just real quick on the LNG, was there a shift in contract versus spot volume exposure that also impacted the quarter? And then that's it for me.\nPierre Breber: Yes, Doug. And first, just on your first question, so the return of capital was Angola LNG. TCO was a dividend withholding tax. But you're right, that part of that does not show up in cash from ops. In terms of DD&A, about half is due to the catch-up at North West Shelf. So we designated that asset as held for sale about 18 months ago. So you're capturing 18 months of depreciation all in the fourth quarter. We don't call the special item because obviously, it would have been in our underlying results if we -- it had been held for use during that time. And the other half are impairments that are tied to increases in abandonment estimates for late in life assets. So because these estimates, which is part of our regular updating process because these assets are very late in life, they don't have the production -- remaining production life or time to recover those additional abandonment estimates and therefore, that results in an impairment. So about half is the catch up and the half -- and those are both, I would call them onetime in nature. And in terms of the LNG, yes, there was a shift in fourth quarter to more contractless spot. We guided to that on the third quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, it was even more so. So in the winter months, our Northern Hemisphere customers tend to increase their takes under the long-term contracts. And then we didn't produce as reliably in the fourth quarter, so we had fewer spot cargoes. So what you're seeing, we did not benefit as much with the run-up in spot prices as we had guided to in the third quarter, and our weighting was more oil contract-related. Now those contracts are doing very well. Spot market goes up and down. But you'll see more exposure as we go forward.\nDouglas Leggate: Pierre, just I guess the point was the headline miss wasn't as bad as it looks. So thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: So the first one I wanted to ask on is just CapEx. I think it's notable that you all came in for last year below the bottom end of your CapEx guide. And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the drivers of that CapEx beat. And then, Pierre, you mentioned before, I think, that you're seeing or assumed a few percentage points of inflation in the Permian. I was wondering if you could just broaden that out and talk about the inflationary trends you're seeing across the global portfolio and opportunities to potentially offset that as you think about 2022 spending levels?\nPierre Breber: So yes, sorry, the low single digits was really meant to be across the portfolio. And that's factored into our $15.3 billion capital program. But obviously, if you look offshore, those rig rates have stayed flat to down. And we do contract where we lock in rates for some services. We have price caps on some services. There's lots of ways that we work to mitigate our exposure to COGS. But -- so I would view it as low single-digits overall. Permian, perhaps a little bit higher, not nearly as high as numbers that I'm hearing from some others. We don't see anything in our cost that would be double digits at all. So a little bit very modest, presented to higher than what we had currently -- we had planned for and again, very manageable within -- by offsetting with efficiencies.\nMichael Wirth: And on 2021, Devin, there's nothing noteworthy in the profile of CapEx and what it was that drove the ultimate outcome, which was a little below what we had guided to. There's a lot of inertia in some of these things and as we pulled the hand break pretty hard in 2020, we throttled a lot of things down. And as we start to bottom out and turn that back around a little bit as we will in 2022, this system just needs to adjust to that. And so I wouldn't call it anything there that's unique or especially noteworthy.\nPierre Breber: We have had, still, about half of the underspend is due to project deferrals like at Tengiz due to COVID and other impact and about half is capital -- greater capital efficiency and other cost savings.\nDevin McDermott: Okay. That's helpful. And then separately, I wanted to ask on Australia LNG and Gorgon specifically. I was wondering if you could talk in a bit more detail around some of the recent downtime there. What happened and then what steps are being taken to ensure better uptime here in 2022?\nMichael Wirth: Yes, I'll take that, Devin. Look, it's a point of frustration, no doubt. During normal rounds, we had an operator that spotted evidence that we had the risk of an operating issue at one of the units in the dehydration train. Nothing that was catastrophic or alarming but a sharp-eyed operator picked up evidence is something that as we investigated further, we felt it was prudent to take a quick pit stop to address this. And so that's been completed at 2 of the 3 trains, and they're all same design. So these things tend to show up across all 3 trains. . The third train is undergoing that pit stop right now and is also addressing a problem with one of the compressors that was identified, and this was an opportune time to make a couple of changes with that in order to reduce risk going forward. So we should -- we expect to operate reliably. We've done our first major turnaround on all 3 trains now, those are behind us at Gorgon. We do not have any planned turnarounds in 2022. And as we complete this last pit stop that's underway, our expectation is that we're going to have strong operational performance this year and see more production out of Gorgon than we did in '21.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Sankey Research.\nPaul Sankey: Guys, on your guidance, the volumes will fall this year, would you characterize that as you\u2019re using a conservative oil price assumption and being determined not to raise CapEx? Or were there other issues around the concessions, particularly? And as a follow-up, could you accelerate the Permian, if you wanted to? Or can you talk about inflationary pressures that you might be seeing in the Permian as a matter of labor, steel, et cetera, et cetera?\nMichael Wirth : Okay. Yes, on production guidance, Paul, I would hope this isn't big news to people. I mean it's -- we've long been public about the fact that we couldn't extend the concessions in Indonesia and Thailand on terms that would compete with other opportunities within our portfolio. And so this has been out in the public domain for quite some time. And so when you pull those out, we're at 2% to 5% and Pierre reiterated the compound annual growth of 3% out through 2025. And so this is very consistent with the guidance and the messaging that we've been trying to communicate for quite some time. On the question of, could you accelerate the Permian? In theory, the answer to that 5 years ago was yes. The answer to that today is yes. We've been very focused on execution, efficiency and returns. And as I said, we laid out in March of last year a profile that showed strong production growth, long plateau, strong returns and capital efficiency. We'll update that again here in the new year, but at March. But this is an asset that just continues to look as good as we've portrayed it to you, and we're not going to get out ahead of ourselves chasing anything as we bring activity back up from $2 billion last year to $3 billion. That's a 50% increase in capital spend. I mentioned that we're going to see a 50% increase in wells put on production in '22 versus '21. That is a meaningful step up in activity, and we want to execute that well. And so I don't think we're going to be tempted by the price of the day to put that at risk by doing more. And I think Pierre already addressed inflation. I don't know, Pierre, if there's anything else you'd like to say on either of those topics.\nPierre Breber : No. Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: My quick question is your U.S. downstream results were down about $400 million quarter-over-quarter and we expected about $200 million of that to be chemicals headwind. But we also saw somewhere so what peers are doing is that refining was able to jump up and make up for it. In this case, it looks like both went down a little. And if you could help us understand what the maintenance in the refining system, what went on in U.S. refining because of which refining was also down quarter-over-quarter?\nPierre Breber: Manav, the -- there were a number of items we referred to, including year-end inventory effects. But the higher employee benefit costs really crosses all segments that would include U.S. downstream. So we had a very strong year. We expect higher employee bonuses and we accrued for that. And our stock ran up in the fourth quarter, and it's continued actually in the first quarter. And we have to do accrual for stock-based compensation that's tied to both the absolute stock price movement and the relative stock price movement because of how some of our incentive programs work. So that's in the segment, and I think that helps explain part of your question.\nManav Gupta: And a quick follow-up is you have a global footprint. Help us understand within your entire system, how you're tracking refined product demand, gasoline, diesel, jet as well, anything you could help us understand where we are versus before the pandemic started.\nMichael Wirth: Yes. Manav, it's -- I think a lot of the data you see in the public domain is pretty good. We've got gasoline demand globally up higher than it was pre pandemic. Diesel at and perhaps slightly above, jet fuel continues to lag. The specific numbers can vary a little bit region by region. But broadly speaking, that's where we are. The ground transport fuels are at or above pre-COVID levels. Aviation is not and we still have an economic recovery underway. And we still have a lot of people working from home. We have people that aren't traveling for business and not taking international flights. And so even with the robust demand recovery that we've seen, there is still another lag to the demand improvement that is likely to occur here in 2022. And so I think the demand outlook is solid. And the issues, frankly, have been a little bit more on the supply side than the demand side.\nOperator: Next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: So I have 2 questions, please. My -- if we're looking at your, I think, well-spoken slogans, lower carbon and higher return in here that Permian definitely is going to contribute to the higher return. Outside Permian, can you help us that to maybe bridge the gap or that you indicate what are the self-help that you guys will drive so that we could see a better return over the next perhaps 1 or 2 years? And the second question is, I want to go back into the Australian LNG as you indicated, I think, has been a source of frustration to management, as well to many people. And it seems like every -- I mean, the plan has only been on stream since 2016, 2015. And so really not that old, but we have all this kind of tiny little problem from different units coming up and niche one every time that they did, same story is all -- everyone there has problem. All the 3 train a problem because they're all under the same design or same manufacturer. So have you guys go into and do a thorough review on all the units and trying to see whether that has other potential time band that we need to face?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. Paul, let me make a quick comment on the returns drivers, and I might ask Pierre to build on it and then I'll come back to LNG. Look, on returns, yes, Permian is highly accretive to returns because we get very, very strong returns out of the Permian, it's short cycle, and we're putting a fair amount of capital into it. We are reducing costs across our business. And as I indicated, we're running Chevron and Noble together today for costs that are lower than Chevron was stand-alone in 2019. So that is an improved -- significant driver of improved returns. We're working across the value chain to capture more margin. That's both in the downstream and in the upstream, a lot of self-help initiatives in the downstream. And so there are -- rather than think about pointing to assets, I would talk to you about the way we work and finding ways to improve efficiency and productivity across all of our operations is what are driving the improvement. And it's really rolling up your sleeves and doing this the old-fashioned way. And it's a lot of little things that you stay very focused on. Pierre, I don't know if you want to add anything else on drivers of return improvement.\nPierre Breber: We'll share more at the upcoming Investor Day, and we've showed it the last couple of investor days, right, what Mike talked about, it's constant margin, we obviously doubled; Noble synergies, we transformed the whole enterprise and reduced costs, working across the value chain and optimizing. As Mike said and Mark Nelson and the downstream has showed some ambitious self-help. And then capital efficiency, both where we're putting new capital and higher returns across the portfolio, and of course, as a lower return prior capital depreciates off. So we'll update you and everyone at our next Investor Day, but that's the playbook that we've been using, and we'll continue to use going forward.\nMichael Wirth: Paul, to your question about Gorgon, you're right. It's not an old facility. And you're right, it has had more than its share of teething pains as we've been here in the first few years of operation. We have people all over this I mentioned earlier that it was a sharp-eyed operator on routine rounds that spotted something that we've addressed and that has averted the possibility of a more serious outage there. And we continue to do so. We don't have -- and a phrase you used, I won't repeat, but we don't have a big problem that's waiting to materialize that we've identified. And we have had strong teams of people from our upstream organization. We've brought people in from our downstream organization that have a lot of experience in these process facilities to work on reliability and mechanical integrity and address any of the things that -- frankly continue the things we've been fixing are things that reflect problems that -- the seeds we're sowing during the design and construction at a time when the industry was under a lot of pressure. And we've talked a lot about how we need to do better and our commitment to improve major capital project performance going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from and Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: A question on the Gulf of Mexico. First of all, any update on the progress of potential deepwater developments in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including an anchor, which builds down like of a sanction, which seems like a lifetime ago. And the courts just canceled the result of a recent lease wholesale in the Gulf of Mexico. Maybe comment on whether you see any potential for incremental headwinds there on the regulatory front that could impact things in the future.\nMichael Wirth: Yes. So a quick update on Anchor. We expect first oil in 2024, and that holds. The whole assembly is complete and commissioning is underway in Korea. We've begun drilling the first development well with a ship called the Deepwater Conqueror. It's a project that's got an attractive development costs, and that's even when you include some costs that are really onetime costs related to new technologies. Similarly, the Whale project, where we're not the operator, is targeted for first oil in 2024 and good progress there. And finally, Mad Dog 2, where we're also in a non-op position is expected to have first oil this year. So a number of projects that are making good progress and an important part of our portfolio. Lease sale 257, which was in the news. Yesterday, we were the apparent high bidder on a large number of blocks there that we found attractive. We're reviewing this judicial decision right now, and so I can't comment more about that. We're disappointed because these lease sales have been conducted successfully in the Gulf of Mexico for decades now and have resulted in us being one of the largest leaseholders out there with over 240 leases. It's a strong part of our base business. It contributes to energy security in this country. These are strong contributors to our portfolio and frankly, some of the lowest carbon intensity barrels that we produce. So we hope this is resolved in a manner that allows continued development and investment in the United States energy economy.\nRyan Todd: All right. And maybe just an overall question on refining. I appreciate some of the comments you made a few minutes ago, but in general, it feels like global product markets have tightened up quite a bit with the outlook looking and pretty encouraging for 2022. How -- can you provide some thoughts about how you're thinking about the setup for refining this year? What looks encouraging and what are some of the potential risks that you see to the outlook?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. I mean I mentioned earlier the demand recovery, which is underway and which still has another leg to it. And we have seen margins strengthen across our portfolio as last year concluded. And so I think those are encouraging signs. Asia still has, I think, some risks. The approach taken by some countries, notably China, to how they've dealt with the pandemic may lead their economy to some risks if these variants continue to emerge. And then, of course, you have some other things in Asia. And again, in China, the situation within the real estate sector poses an uncertainty, I think, to some of the economic numbers there overall. So -- but broadly speaking, I think you're right, Ryan. We're seeing strengthening on the refining side, we're seeing utilization improve. And the chemical sector has continued to be strong, although it has been moderating from the highs early last year, still above mid-cycle as it's kind of trending back towards that. And so I think we're setting up for a stronger year in '22 than we saw in '21 across that sector.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alastair Syme with Citi.\nAlastair Syme: I just had one question, and it's a follow-up to the question you made on returns. And I'll just really make a simple high-level observation that 2021 cash flow [$31 billion] ex working capital is almost identical to what was delivered in 2018 and then almost identical oil price environment. But of course, the payout ratio has risen considerably over the last 3 years. And my question is really what does the Board think it's seeing gives us the confidence to raise that payout ratio so meaningfully?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. It's the capital efficiency is the big driver, Alastair. So you're right. The commodity price environments in those 2 years are pretty similar. Cash from ops, pretty similar, although there can be some moving parts in there that are not necessarily just commodity price. But we have capital spend that is significantly down from that period of time, which means free cash flow is significantly higher. And our belief going forward, our capital guidance going forward is $15 billion to $17 billion for the next 5 years. It has come down from $19 billion to $22 billion pre COVID. So that's a structural downshift. Our production guidance has not changed. And so what we have is a portfolio that is generating free cash flow and future cash flows in a much more capital-efficient manner which allows us to return more capital to shareholders. So that's a simple story.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Biraj Borkhataria, RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: It's actually just a follow-up on North West Shelf and that reclassification there. Could you just provide a bit more color on the rationale for that? Is that a change in your intentions there? And obviously, the last couple of years is not a great time to be selling assets. I'm just wondering if that was a function of you not getting the valuation this you desired or something else?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. Biraj, I think what we've said previously, we had an unsolicited offer on North West Shelf going back a period of time, which led us to an interesting conversation. And we want value -- we're not in a position where we need to sell assets to generate cash. But if an asset works better for somebody else and they see a different value equation that we do, that's certainly a conversation worth having. And so over the last period of time, we've been in a conversation like that. It ultimately has not led to a transaction. And so it's just changed the accounting classification for that asset. It's a good asset to generate strong cash flow. Obviously, we're in a market today where LNG demand is very high, and there's a lot of gas in Australia still to run through these plants. And so it's a nice part of our portfolio.\nPierre Breber: Yes. Just to echo that, I view it more as accounting-related than anything else. There's a number of criteria that need to be met for asset held for sale, and there's just one part that no longer has met. And so that's why we did the catch-up depreciation.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay. That's very clear. And then the second follow-up was on Tengiz. I think you previously mentioned the potential sort of loan repayments back to the parent. Do you have any guidance for 2022, given the current pricing environment?\nPierre Breber: Our guidance is no loan repayment, but also no additional loans. The dividend is included in the overall affiliate dividend I will make a point, we changed our guidance from focusing on the cash flow line, which is affiliate income less dividends and just focus on the true cash part. If you look back to that line, which again is the difference between income and dividends from our affiliates, it's still about -- our income from affiliates is expected to be about $2 billion higher than the dividends. But no loan, no loan repayment. We had a little bit of repayment last year. Again, we had our first dividend in a number of years in December. And in the current price environment, obviously, we expect strong dividends from Tengiz this year. It's a matter up to their Board. And as the project is completed and comes on, then the ability to increase dividends further and pay back alone, and we'll share more on the cash flow generation capability of Tengiz during our Investor Day.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jason Gabelman from Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: The first one is just on international gas exposure. Even backing out this timing impact, it looked like the realizations were a bit light. And I thought it would be helpful if maybe you could talk through that international gas exposure, the different pricing exposures within that, maybe splitting it up between pump-based, LNG-based, fixed price or however you think about the commodity exposure within that production bucket? And the second question, thinking about CapEx, I think your message is loud and clear that this year you're going to be around that $15 billion and you're going to manage the business to that. But as we look forward and think about where you could ramp up spend, is that $17 billion high end of the range? Is that where you think the kind of ramp up in spending you could do in your short-cycle basins? Or is there, in theory, if oil prices stay at elevated levels, can you ramp up in your short-cycle basins even more? And once again, I'm not thinking about this year, in particular, but in the future, if we're in an environment where oil prices stay elevated.\nPierre Breber: Jason, I'll take your first question. So on our LNG portfolio, you can think of it about as an 80% oil linked, 20% JKM. That includes Australia but also West Africa, so Angola LNG and Equatorial Guinea. If you look to our international gas though, we have lots of other gas contracts around the world. As you say, some are fixed price, some are partially oil related with a lag. And so you won't see necessarily that direct effect. We have some that are low and, for example, in West Africa, that go to domestic markets. But if you look overall for the LNG, those 3 countries, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Australia, 80-20 is pretty good. Australia now is a little bit higher because we had an additional long-term contract, but the West Africa LNG is largely spot-related and JKM or TTF price-related.\nMichael Wirth: And on longer term CapEx, if I caught your question, Jason. Look, we get this range of 15 to 17. We've put out there. We're at the low end of the range. this year. Now that's a 30% step-up from where we finished 2021. And as I mentioned earlier, in a place like the Permian, it's a 50% step-up. So it's not a trivial change, but it's still a very disciplined approach to that business. And we intend to stay within that range as we've guided. Can we move around within it? Yes. Can that include additional short cycle, yes. And as we have -- as the project in Kazakhstan winds down, that opens up some capacity within that range to allocate capital to other high-return investments. And so we've got plenty of levers to pull. But I think the overarching message that investors should take away is we're going to stay disciplined on capital. We're not chasing price. We're improving returns and you can count on us to continue to do that. And we should generate very strong free cash flow in this environment.\nJason Gabelman: Sorry, just to clarify, I think your guidance was on LNG. I was hoping to get it on the broader international gas price exposure.\nPierre Breber: That's just a mix of contracts, Jason. I'd follow up with Roderick. I mean I think we show our realization by country, but we don't have a short hand on how to characterize because it really is a mix of contracts in a number of countries outside the U.S.\nRoderick Green: I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Jen, back to you.\nOperator: This concludes Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-10-29 14:59:05", "content": "Operator: Please standby. We're about to begin. Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.\nRoderick Green: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron 's third quarter earnings conference call. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. And on the call with me today are Mark Nelson, EVP of Downstream and Chemicals; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Roderick. We reported third quarter earnings of $6.1 billion or $3.19 per share, highest reported earnings in more than eight years. Adjusted earnings were $5.7 billion or $2.96 per share. The quarter's results included two special items: asset sale gains of $200 million and pension settlement costs of $81 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Adjusted ROCE was greater than 13% and we lowered our net debt ratio to below 19%. Strong operating cash flow enabled us to deliver on our financial priorities, including the resumption of share repurchases. Compared to before COVID, operating costs are down, upstream production is up, and we're much more capital efficient. Cost efficiency and capital efficiency are essential to navigate commodity price cycles. Providing resilience through the low periods and leveraging upside when markets are strong. This has been evident over the past several quarters, and especially so in the most recent one, as we generated Company record free cash flow higher than the strongest quarters in 2008 and 2011 when oil prices were well over $100 a barrel. Adjusted earnings -- adjusted third quarter earnings were up more than $5 billion versus last year; primarily on higher prices, margins, and volumes. Compared with last quarter, adjusted third quarter earnings were up almost $2.5 billion. Adjusted Upstream earnings increased on higher realizations and positive timing effects primarily related to managing LNG portfolio pricing exposure. Adjusted Downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining and marketing margins. The all other variance was positive due to lower corporate charges and the use of deferred tax assets, which previously had evaluation allowance. Third quarter oil equivalent production increased 7% year-over-year due to the Noble acquisition and lower curtailments, partly offset by price-related entitlement effects and asset sales. I'll now pass it over to Mark.\nMark Nelson: Thanks, Pierre. In downstream and chemicals, we delivered our best adjusted earnings in more than four years. Demand for our product is strong, with recovery of jet fuel sales expected as international travel gradually returns. And while the improving market environment helps, we're focused on what we can control. Safe and reliable operations, capital and cost efficiency and value chain optimization, to drive higher returns. Some examples of our self-help actions include: using digital tools to improve planning, scheduling, and prioritization of maintenance activity, leveraging data analytics and asset flexibility to increase margins, and adopting new technology like robotic inspection in maintenance procedures. During our Investor Day in March, I highlighted that self-help is expected to drive higher returns for Downstream and Chemicals. We're on track to meet that guidance with benefits already flowing to the bottom line. Chemicals performance is also strong, as CPChem responds to current market conditions while continuing to keep a focus on longer-term unit cost reduction. GS Caltex reached 100% design capacity of its mixed feed cracker ahead of schedule and under budget. The CPChem U.S. Gulf Coast II Project continues to advance towards a final investment decision in a disciplined way that positions the project to earn attractive returns through the cycle.  And Ras Laffan Project is in FEED and we continue to evaluate this project. We believe in the long-term fundamentals of chemicals, our investment focus continues to be on the low end of the supply cost curve, advantage feed stock, competitive capital and cost structure, and strong project execution. Since our energy transition spotlight, we closed the acquisition of an equity interest in American natural gas and its network of 60 CNG retail sites with our partner, Mercuria, enabling us to meet customers\u2019 needs beyond California. We're also delivering first gas through our Brightmark partnership and all CalBioGas farms are now online. We sold the first sustainable aviation fuel produced from our El Segundo Refinery to Delta Airlines at LAX. And earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire Neste's Group 3 base oil business and its next base brand. Pending regulatory approval, we anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2022. The acquisition is expected to provide a capital efficient approach to expand our base oil offerings. And coupled with Novvi's renewable products, position Chevron to be the supplier of choice to meet customers' needs now and into the future. Back to you, Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Mark. We recently released an updated climate change resilience report, which includes a stress tests and portfolio under IEA's Net Zero 2050 scenario. A new target called portfolio carbon intensity, that includes Scope 1 and 2 and Scope 3 emissions from the use of our products and Chevron 's Net Zero 2050 aspiration for Upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions. I encourage everyone to read our latest report available on our website. Now looking ahead. In the fourth quarter, we expect lower production due to a planned turnaround at Wheatstone, which was completed last week and repairs at the Alba gas plant and Equatorial Guinea. In addition, our participation in Rokan PSC in Indonesia ended in August. Production from Rokan averaged 84,000 barrels of oil equivalent year-to-date. We expect earnings from JKM-related spot sales out of Australia to increase around $50 million from three quarter -- from third quarter, due to fewer spot cargoes as our long-term customers increased deliveries heading into winter. We're also expecting three discrete cash items, the return of capital from Angola LNG, TCO's first dividend in several years, and a federal income tax cash refund. There are no P&L impacts from these items. During 4Q, we expect to buy back shares at the high end of our guidance range. Finally, we're lowering our full-year C&E guidance to $12 billion to $13 billion, primarily due to COVID-related project spend deferrals into next year, lower non-op CapEx in the Permian, and continued capital efficiencies. To wrap up the quarter, we continue to make progress towards our objective of higher return, lower carbon. We're more capital and cost efficient, generated record free cash flow, and are taking actions to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow lower-carbon businesses. We're executing a straightforward strategy that's expected to deliver value now and well into the future. With that, I will turn it back over to Roderick.\nRoderick Green: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get to all your questions. Please open up the lines, Katie.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin Mcdermott: Good morning. Congrats on the great results. So my first question, Pierre, I think is for you. I just wanted to ask for a little bit more detail on the reduction in the capital spending guidance for this year. It sounds like it's a mix of different factors. Some of it's deferrals next year, some of it's a mix of non-op and efficiency gains. Can you just bridge the delta a little bit more detail for us and also talk about whether or not these deferrals or how these deferrals impact planned 2022 spend?\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Devin. We lowered our CapEx guidance to $12 billion to $13 billion. That's from our budget of $14 billion, and from our revised guidance that we had in the second quarter of $13 billion. So in the last quarter, what's changed -- while we continue to see non-op spend in the Permian below our expectations, we did have some deferred major capital project spending tied to Hurricane Ida and the Delta variant wave. And then we've seen -- continue to see continued capital efficiency across in the Permian and across the portfolio.  It does not change our CapEx guidance -- our CapEx guidance for next year and through 2025 is $15 billion to $17 billion. We do expect higher CapEx in the fourth quarter and next year. The low end of that range is about a 20% increase from the midpoint of our revised guidance. So these deferrals are very manageable. And again, I would think from the original $14 billion budget, about half, you can think of a deferral and half I would say is capital efficiency and cost-savings what we're getting, the same results at -- for less capital.\nDevin Mcdermott: Got it. Makes a lot of sense. And then my follow-ups on cash returns. So very strong free cash flow in the quarter. Your debt target is now below the bottom end of your target range. It's good to see the increase in the cadence of the buyback in 4Q, I guess my question is, what are some of things you're looking for to further increase that buyback target back to something closer to the pre-COVID run rate?\nPierre Breber: As you said, Devin, our guidance for fourth quarter is at the high end of the range, so that's a 3 billion annual rate or 750 million in the quarter. And as I said, last quarter, and I'll restate now, we'll increase the buyback range, when Chevron's net debt ratio was comfortably below 20%. We ended three -- third quarter with a net debt ratio, a little bit under 19%, down from 21% at the end of the second quarter. So we just got below 20%, but we're fast approaching a net debt level where we could increase the buyback range further. As a reminder, Devin, I know, you know this, we intend to maintain our buyback for multiple years through the cycle. And so we're positioning our balance sheet below our mid-cycle range, so that will enable us to continue buybacks even if the cycle turns.\nDevin Mcdermott: Got it. Very helpful, makes sense. Congrats again on the strong quarter.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Devin.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, I just want to echo great results here. Pierre, I want you to take a moment to talk about the global gas market. You spend a lot of time looking at this over the years. How do you see it playing out from here? And there a lot of moving pieces as it relates to your gas portfolio. But one would be just any thoughts around spot cargos and the other would be it looked like you had some timing effects in the quarter that supported earnings. I would think that would unwind later on, but just any modeling advice there. So a lot of moving pieces there, but your thoughts on the cash portfolio.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Neil. First, I'd say that we are seeing high gas prices. It does feel more cyclical than structural. We've seen demand very resilient through COVID on natural gas, in particular, and supply has been impacted in part by lower associated gas, just a slowdown in some supply activities. So seeing demand and supply a little bit out, I don't think it's something that we've seen in the past and we expect that markets will work. We're seeing a commodity pricing right now, and we expect markets to rebalance over time. We have a very strong natural gas business. We have a nice position in North America, Australia, Eastern Med through Noble Energy, and in Africa. And so we're well-positioned there. There's not much in the short-term that we can really do to increase supply. We have position in the Haynesville and we could increase activity there. But that will have a modest impact on a Company of our size. I think over the medium to longer-term, we're working expansion opportunities and particularly in Eastern Med, and I think this is positive for signing up customers and enabling kind of the next, next phase of expansion there. So it's something that we're certainly well positioned for and we're looking to expand supply into it. In terms of the quarter, a couple of things. Yes, we did have a trading timing effect that was related to LNG. And that's really tied to how we manage our overall portfolio pricing, so we have customer contracts that are oil-linked and JKM linked, and then we have various supplies and we try to match up the pricing, And in order to do that, we essentially, went along with some JKM paper, which clearly was mark-to-market positive in the quarter. Now, that's going to be matched against some physical deliveries in future quarters. So we call that timing because we expect to see that unwind when those physical cargoes are delivered. And then the last piece of guidance we had was really on fourth quarter earnings effects. We guided towards $50 million of increased earnings in 4Q versus 3Q from Australia LNG spot cargoes. And that's just to make the point that we are going to have spot cargoes. We have all five trains operating, the Wheatstone plan turnaround is complete. And we'll have actually more cargoes delivered in fourth quarter when you think of contract and spot. But because it's heading into winter and most of our -- many of our customers on the Northern Hemisphere, their nomination seasonally pick up heading into the winter. And so they will have higher takes under the long-term contracts which are oil linked.  And that means we will fewer cargoes getting the higher JKM prices. So higher prices clearly in JKM, 4Q versus 3Q, fewer cargoes, that's a net benefit of about 50 million. We also have some exposure out of our -- both Angola LNG and Equatorial Guinea, and so you can think about another 50 million or so from spot cargoes from those operations. So, sorry it's a long answer to cover the full breadth of natural gas this quarter.\nNeil Mehta: No, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces. Now, that's great. And Pierre, you're tracking really well on CapEx this year, now, I think, initially 14 then 13 now, it looks like as low as 12. Next year, if I remember, CapEx is 15 to 17 is the range that you talked about. Are -- is it fair to assume that the lower capital spend this year would suggest that you'd be on the lower end of that range? And any moving pieces that we should think about as you set up the 2022 spend level?\nPierre Breber: You will see us increase capital in the fourth quarter just to get to that $12 billion to $13 billion because we're at $8.1 billion through third quarters. And you'll see that in the Permian, two more rigs, two more completion crews. We'll have higher activity levels at Tengiz. We're going to maintain peak manpower through the winter. And then activity tends to be back-loaded, so -- back-end loaded. So we have some project milestone payments, we have exploration wells that we'll be drilling in the fourth quarter.  So you'll see an increase in fourth quarter. I think we will announce our 2022 budget in December like we normally do. It'll be within the guidance and I think it's fair to say it will be towards the low end of the guidance. Again, even being at the bottom of the guidance of $15 billion of organic capital, that's at least a 20% increase off the midpoint of the guidance we just gave for this year. So, again, I don't want to get ahead of that, but you should expect us to see capital in the lower end of that guidance range.\nNeil Mehta: Good stuff. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Well, thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nPierre Breber: Good morning.\nDoug Leggate: Pierre and Mark, thanks for taking my questions. Pierre, I hate to ask a housekeeping question, but you've got to help me out here a little bit on tax. The way I'm thinking about this is that there's been a lot of changes and post-Noble. Your mix has changed and obviously we've got a lot more profitability in the U.S. with overall tax rates. So can you help me? Is what's going on the tax sustainable or is there a mix issue or is there something unusual going on because as we saw your tax rate going up? I'm worried that we are carrying too high a tax rate going forward.\nPierre Breber: The tax benefits in the third quarter which we cited are real. So this is a deferred tax asset. It was acquired through Noble. At the time of closing the transaction, we put a valuation allowance against it because these taxes attributes have a -- they expire after a certain number of years, and based on projections of financial performance at that time, we thought they would expire without us being able to use them. Our financial performance is so much stronger that we actually were able to use them in the third quarter. So that reduces our taxes both on an earnings and on a cash basis.  So it's very real and it's an additional synergy from Noble and it's not something that was included in our synergy estimates. That is not something that necessarily will recur, we'll do a review of all of our tax attributes at year-end, and see again what differed tax assets could have value going forward based on a change in condition. But, again, I would cite that, that was in the all other segment. It's not something that you would expect to recur.\nDoug Leggate: That's really helpful, thanks. And then I suppose I can push you to quantify what our noble contribution was, right?\nPierre Breber: Well, it's the primary variance in that segment. So we talked about lower corporate charges and tax benefits.\nDoug Leggate: All right. My follow-up is really on balance sheet issue, but obviously going back 5 years ago, you guys [inaudible 00:19:55] net debt as this is leaving a lot of projects going quiet back then. When you think about the cost of debt, which is obviously very, very low, and we'll see if it stays there, versus the way you think about per-share dividend growth. So I'm trying to think, Exxon talks now about 20% to 25% has been the right level for them. Excuse me, your head around, below that kind of level so what is the right level for you, given that, you can obviously refinance at very economic level and obviously, step up for buybacks, if you chose to.\nPierre Breber: When I became CFO, we -- I answered this question that we didn't have a hard target on our net debt ratio, but 20% to 25% is a good place for us to be through the cycle. And there could be times where we go above it. For example, when we showed our stress test, the only Company in the industry to show a stress test last year at $30 brand for two years, to give confidence our investors that we could maintain the dividend, our net debt ratio did go above 25%. So that's appropriate. We do not need to be anywhere close to where we were before with no net debt. But when prices are above mid-cycle, we should be below the low end of the range. And we are. We got to less than 19% now, and we're fast approaching a range where we could increase our buyback -- our buyback guidance. So it's very close to where we're at. All the excess cash that we'll be generating under these conditions, and we showed that at $60 even, prices well below where we're at now, that we can generate $25 billion of excess cash over 5 years. This is cash in excess of our capital and our dividends. All that cash will be returned to shareholders over time in the form of a rising dividend. And again, our dividend is up 12% since pre - COVID, the biggest increase in the sector. And a buyback that's rateable and we maintain through the cycle. We buy back shares 14 and last 18 years. And so when we set a buyback rate, we intend to maintain it through the cycle. That means we will maintain it when the cycle turns, and which means that we can in fact be doing it off of debt for some time period, and we'll rebalance back into the range, when we continue to buy back shares, when -- if and when the cycle does turn down.\nDoug Leggate: Let's hope that's not anytime soon because last year is still -- we still got scars from last year Pierre. Thanks so much for your answers. I appreciate it.\nPierre Breber: Thank you, Doug.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions.\nPierre Breber: Morning Wai.\nJenny Wang: Good morning. We wanted to follow-up on Devin's question and I guess Dave's question as well, getting back to the buyback. Pierre, you have already commented that you plan to maintain the buyback through multiple years through the price cycle, which is great. I think we remember prior commentary that the goal is to not have to reduce the buyback once it's started. So we wanted to just check in on that and how you think that the trajectory of any buyback increases. It sounds more ratable versus opportunistic. We know there's a tremendous amount of free cash flow coming your way, but also it seems like investor expectations are running alongside that versus being more ratable, and that the strip is backward dated. So we just wanted to check on the trajectory.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Janeen, if you look back to our history, we've never ended a buyback program at the rate that we started. We tend to have increased them. And I think you might be right that we haven't decreased them. Look, I'm not opposed to that. We have a range. We're using the range. We were in the middle of the range in the third quarter. It's the first quarter that we -- since we've resumed buybacks. We bought back shares in the first quarter of last year, pre-Covid. And now we're using the top of the range.  And as I said, we're fast approaching a net debt level, where we can increase that guidance range further. So no, our focus is on being ratable and maintain it through the cycle. Investors -- our investors, our shareholders, have different views on buybacks where we have the most common ground, is do it consistently, and do it through the cycle when times are good and when times are tougher. And so we're setting the rates at a level that we have confidence that we can maintain it through a commodity price cycle.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Great, thank you for that. Our second question is really on the Permian and the outlook on capital allocation. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing on inventory and supply demand, and maybe how close are you to potentially accelerating in the Permian, a little bit beyond of what you've already laid out? And I guess on that, we know that it doesn't get much attention, but could you also be thinking about increasing activity in other short-cycle plays? Thank you.\nPierre Breber: We're going to increase capital in the fourth quarter and into next year. And so that'll be in the Permian and they'll be in other locations. Again, as I said, even the bottom end of our guidance range $15 billion represents at least a 20% increase from where we expect to end up this year. And we're seeing that in the fourth quarter. We'll see 2 additional rigs in Permian, 2 additional completion crews. We are beginning to see a non-op pickup, also, again, that's part of the reason why we lowered our guidance. Non-op has been a bit below our expectations. And you can see it in other basins. We have a great portfolio with a number of short-cycle investments, but we're not changing our overall CapEx guidance range. Our CapEx guidance anticipated that we would be in a recovery mode and it would increase overtime.  And we showed a 5 year outlook on the Permian that shows that we can grow production as an outcome of a very capital efficient and -- but also carbon efficient development of resource that we can grow that production from 600,000 barrels a day to 1 million barrels a day. So we're executing our plan. There's really no change in what we're doing. It's playing out the way we expected. And seeing a buildup in activity in the Permian and across other parts of our portfolio is what we had planned to do and we're going to do that in a very capital and cost efficient way.\nJenny Wang: Great, thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh: Hey, Pierre. First question here, just kind of circling around the capital allocation piece a little bit more. Back in March, you talked about having 25 billion of excess cash or greater than 25 billion in excess cash over 5 years at 60, implicitly suggesting the dividend would be covered around 50-ish brands I believe. I'm just curious if as you progress through this year, the performance that you've seen etc., has anything changed with that, to make you think that that break in would be moving lower, or is that still an area where you're comfortable with?\nPierre Breber: That's an area where we're comfortable with. It's just keeping oil prices constant, right? We're seeing Mark Nelson 's Downstream & Chemicals Group perform very well. We've talked about natural gas pricing being strong both in North America, Europe, and International LNG. So those things aren't held constant. So if you look at this quarter's result, I think you'd see our break-even would be a little bit lower, but in terms of mid-cycle assumptions for refining margins, chemical margins, natural gas prices, and then an oil break even about 50 is certainly where we're at.  Now that -- of course that changes as our dividend goes up and other things over time because it's a dividend break-even is covering our capital and our dividend. But that math is still intact. We are a better Company than we were a few years ago. We showed that chart where our costs are lower, our production is higher, and we're much more capital efficient. We can sustain and grow this enterprise with less capital and that helps us deliver higher returns and lower carbon.\nPhil Gresh: Got it. And then just a follow-up question on Wheatstone, there were some reports from your partners about reserves being written down there. I just wanted to get your commentary, how do you think about this? Does that mean something in terms of future capital requirements, given that it's a longer cycle project as any commentary you'd have there? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: It's unrelated to Chevron. So if you recall, the Wheatstone Project was the 1st project in Australia and maybe the world where there were third-party. The reserves, the resources came from two different joint ventures. And so it was Apache at the time and now it's Woodside. So it was really Woodside announcing that the fields that supply their portion of -- that's told through Wheatstone, that those reserves have a write-down. Chevron does not have an interest in those reserves so the fields -- the Chevron fields that supply Wheatstone are not affected. And again, it's unrelated to Chevron activity. It's only that they essentially -- we share the facility through them and those fields are also being processed through. Wheatstone is doing very well. We had a plan turnaround that covered a portion of third quarter and early into fourth quarter, as I said it was completed last week, and we expect to have all 5 of our Australia trains operating this quarter. And as I said, we expect more cargoes. There is a lot of focus on JKM, but of course our oil-linked contract prices will also be higher because they adjust with -- oil prices are higher, and then they adjust with oil prices on a 3-month to 6-month lag.\nPhil Gresh: Great, thanks for the clarification there.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Phil,\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. Maybe a high level question and you did your energy transition spotlight event a little while back. You said a share of the capital budget at close to local run businesses, being close to 10% of the capital budget. You've seen one of your peers here in the U.S. raise theirs to a similar level. If you think about the feedback that you've received since then, our view was that it was a pragmatic balance between allocation of capital towards good low-carbon businesses but not too much to kind of protect returns dilution going forward. Is 10% of the budget do you see as -- as you've seen feedback over the last couple of months, do you view that 10% of the budget is enough, or do you think that's going to be something where you're going to see increasing pressure to kind of creep that higher going forward.\nPierre Breber: I'll start and then I'll ask Mark to talk a little bit about some of our renewable fuels activities in his portfolio. We have good shareholder support in alignment for our strategy and objectives of high returns, lower carbon. That's both lowering the carbon intensity of our traditional operations and then growing low-carbon businesses that leverage our strengths, our capabilities, assets, and customer relationships. And they target the sectors that cannot be easily electrified, the hard to abate sector. So this is things like air travel, industrial emissions, heavy-duty transport.  The $10 billion of capital is connected to some pretty ambitious targets that go up to 2030. So 150,000 tons per annum of hydrogen, 25 million tons per year of carbon capture and storage. That's all consistent with that capital guidance. So we are more in the execution mode and getting it done versus, let's say competing on CapEx targets. It's not easy to do, these are ambitious targets. They have challenges, lots of opportunity, but let me ask Mark to talk a bit about his portion of that on renewable fuels.\nRoderick Green : Thanks for the question, Ryan. I could use a real tangible example. You think about our El Segundo Refinery in our diesel hydrotreater conversion. We've said a few things are really important to us when it comes to renewable diesel. We've said that the ability to sell it at the appropriate margin, the ability to have the right kind of feedstocks, and the ability to be capital efficient is critical for us to be successful. In Southern California, in the El Segundo Refinery are an example of all of that. We've already increased our sales -- we're getting close to 40%, let's say over 30% of renewable and biodiesel in Southern California. We have our Bungie joint venture, where we're working towards definitive agreements as we speak, and yet they're already supplying us at the El Segundo Refinery. And finally, and perhaps most importantly,\nMark Nelson: capital efficiency. We indicated in our energy transition spotlight that we expect to be a leader in the capital conversion of particular hydroprocessing units in our system. And we believe we can do that for less than a dollar per gallon of annual capacity. And that's including any pretreatment requirements, that gives us the ability to produce both renewable diesel and conventional diesel just with a catalyst change, if that's necessary. So when you step back and you think about that work that's been done initially at El Segundo where we did our co-processing investment for very, very little money, we were able to test tanking and piping and metallurgy needs, and now we're working towards a full conversion of that diesel hydrotreater here by the end of next year. That won\u2019t be easy, but the team is working really hard on it, making very good progress and that would be a 100% renewable diesel capacity and over 10,000 barrels a day. Thanks for the question, Ryan.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks, Mark, maybe a follow-up on some of your comments earlier, Pierre, where you mentioned, when you were talking about gas market and you mentioned the Eastern Med opportunities. You haven't talked about that much in a little while. In your conversations with potential buyers of that gas in the base, and I mean, in the past, when it was operated by Noble, it was -- there was a talk of everything between European targets to pipelines to Egypt, to floating LNG, and all sorts of opportunities. Any thoughts on what may look like it makes the most sense there in the Eastern Med and opportunities for whether it's shorter-term de - bottlenecking and an opportunity there versus longer-term project development?\nPierre Breber: All options are still on the table, Ryan, and it's commercially sensitive, so I don't want to show our hand in any way. I mean, the point is that this is a great resource. There's some very low-cost expansions that can be done and there's some larger expansions that can be done over time. What's really changed is that was in a geography that a year ago looked oversupplied for natural gas and now looks much tighter. And so as you know, natural gas business internationally is really dependent on getting customers to sign up.  And I think customers are more motivated now and it's probably overdone as I said earlier, we expect the markets to correct, but it is a better time for us to be engaging. So it's a great resource in many cases is backing out coal, it has expansion opportunities and free cash flow positive from the moment that we closed Noble. So it's just a great asset and it's well-positioned now to have opportunities to grow in the future.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, everyone. Pierre, if I could start with you. Would it be possible to try and normalize your exposure to LNG given that there's so many moving parts over the course of the past year or so. I'm just noticing that you said during your comments that your spot exposure will be somewhat different in Q4 as a result of customers pulling long-term contracts. If we could just take the part of it and further normalize into 2022, 2023, where are your volumes and how much of that is going to be long -term versus spot? If you could have a go at that. Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Paul we'll cover that more in our fourth-quarter call when we give full-year guidance on a number of items, we have a long-term contract that will begin next year, so it will take are waiting too long term contracts a little bit higher again, we've been notionally around 80%. But that's something -- that's why we very consciously just provided guidance for this quarter as it will change a little bit next year, but we'll do that on the fourth-quarter call.\nPaul Sankey: Okay. I'll move on to more. But if I could just slip a quick one of a few in regards to modeling, do I assume that we've put everything into buyback in terms of free cash flow, or are there any other items that you would highlight maybe pension with something that we should just be aware of going into 2022, and how much we consider your buyback to be? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Over time the vast majority of the excess cash will be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividend and the buyback. We did a one-time pension supplement last quarter, it was really tied to the very low interest rates from a year ago. It sounds like a long time ago. But under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation rules, the funding requirement is fixed by on the year-end interest rates. And so we were a little bit underfunded and therefore, would have paid a little higher, that's called a variable interest rate essentially, higher than our cost of borrowing, and so that's why we supplemented it.  Obviously, we're in a much different place in terms of interest rates now, and you'd expect our pension contributions to be, has they have been. And we provide guidance on pension in our 10-Q filings. So I would not expect anything on that end. So, again, if you go to our financial priorities, Paul, you know them well. Sustain and grow the dividend. It's up 12% since pre-COVID, the biggest increase in the sector. Our capital guidance is going to be up, but it's no change from the guidance range and it's in a very tight guidance range and very capital efficient and lower where it was pre-COVID.  We're going to pay down a little more debt. As I said, we're fast approaching a level where we can increase our buyback range. And so then, the balance is excess cash, and over time, it goes to shareholders. We're not going to sweep out each quarter because investors are very clear that they want us to maintain a buyback through the cycle.\nPaul Sankey: I guess that would mean no specials.\nPierre Breber: I think it's time for you to ask the question to Mark.\nPaul Sankey: Mark. Thanks. Thanks, Pierre. Mark, very general question, but could you talk about how capacity is changing Downstream, both in refining and in chemicals? Because I know we're adding a lot of Chemicals. Obviously we are also shutting down a lot of Downstream house. Seriously, is there any way that the Chevron 's dramatically changing its capacity and exposure Downstream? And secondly, could you talk about that in the context of where you see U.S. in global capacity? I know this could take two hours, apologize, but if you could generally say how global capacity shifted, and the more numbers you could give us, the better. Thanks.\nMark Nelson: Yeah, thanks, Paul. Let's start with the refining side of the business here. We've unused margin as the proxy for capacity being utilized here. We've said demand has to recover for high-value products. Inventory, we have to fall in the traditional ranges and then we need some degree of refinery rationalization, either closures or conversions throughout the system. If you're in the U.S. today, I think you're seeing much of that -- much of that demand recovery with Jet still to come and that's even with offices not completely open, and still some restrictions in place.  Inventory tending to find itself in traditional boundaries and starting to see some closures and/or conversions in some of our markets especially the U.S. West Coast, which means the market could be -- could actually be tight on things like motor gasoline, and even Jet 5 or 6 years from now. So you see that in the U.S.. If I shift to Asia, I would say that demand recovery on Jet is a little bit behind that of the U.S. especially given our exposure to Southeast Asia. Inventory reduction, falling into those ranges is starting to happen, some of that with China stopping some of its exports for the moment.  But demand catching up with refinery capacity in Asia is still needs to happen in that. That's means we both need some, perhaps some rationalization as well as demand just to catch up with the capacity that's there. And so my high-level comment would be that in the U.S., we're seeing the actions to bring refinery margins into balance over time getting closer to historic ranges in just a half phase behind that maybe, in Asia. And then for the petchem side of the equation, petchem margins have had a strong run this year on the back of good demand and considerable supply disruptions.  We would expect to see margins come off as we get to the fourth quarter normal seasonal type of drop-off. But we're actually preparing for -- with capacity growth over the next few years. We expect that to outpace demand, so we're at that part of the cycle. And even in 2025, we're presuming we'll be on the lower portion of the margin cycle. So that means that there will be a period of catch-up there in regard to demand catching capacity. Hope I got to your quiz.\nPaul Sankey: You did. Thanks, Mark. And just from a Chevron point of view, is there any major changes in your capacity over the next 5 years that you anticipate refining and chemicals? Thanks.\nMark Nelson: Other than the comments we've made about -- you remember it was about a decade ago that we didn't match of our what I'll call rationalization, meaning taking things out of our portfolio. And we've highlighted energy transition spotlight that we have this opportunity for this very capital efficient conversion of individual hydroprocessing units. And we will certainly do that over the next decade to get to that 100,000 barrels a day of our DSAF (ph) capacity.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Paul. We're going to have to go to the next one.\nPaul Sankey: Bye.\nMark Nelson: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: We're going next to Rodger Reed with Wells Fargo.\nRodger Reed: Thank you and good morning. Pierre, I'm going to hit you on capital returns, buybacks, and balance sheet. No I'm just kidding. Mark, I would like to ask you about the group oil-based three acquisition kind of how that fits in the overall structuring, and what we should think about there and whether or not we've seen some stories about renewable feed stock for Group 3, and maybe how you see that working in over time?\nMark Nelson: Yes. Thanks, Roger. As mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're excited about the announced acquisition of Neste's Group III Base Oil Business and the Nexbase brand, and the reason for that is, it's a very capital efficient acquisition of both offtake of supply, appropriate qualifications, and the brand -- index-based brand itself. And what that does for us is it allows us to expand our offerings. So we're going to add that to our existing Group II, II+ and over Novvi offering to have a complete offering for the base oil needs for our customers in the future. And think about that Novvi brand that we've talked about, I think in the Energy transition spotlight, we shared that Walmart would be selling online our Havoline Pro-RS, the first renewable lubricant line.  And we've actually brought some of that forward. And starting next Monday, we will have our installer base in North America, specifically the U.S. and Canada, in particular, running a whole line of Havoline Pro-RS. So we're creating that demand for the renewable portion of that offering. And it really gives us something where we can be that supplier of the future for our base oil customers. Thanks for the question, Rodger.\nRodger Reed: Yeah, absolutely. And then if we could come back to some of the things on the CapEx, you've referenced delays out of the Gulf of Mexico due to the storms, which totally makes sense. As you look at the development and some of the exploration, I think you're looking to do out there in the next couple of years, is there any change to that or any sort of change in the order of projects we should pay attention to?\nPierre Breber: No, we have a steady stream of projects really with Anchor that has been underway. Whale that recently went to a final investment decision and Ballymore which is coming along. So you will see a very ratable development program. Gulf of Mexico is a high return, low carbon asset. Some of the lowest carbon intensity barrels in our portfolio in the single-digits. And is a business that we've been invested in for decades, have know-how, and competitive advantages and can find attractive investment opportunities.  So it's sort of a modestly growing part of the portfolio. Do you think of the biggest growth that we have going forward clearly is in the Permian, which I referred to earlier, Tengiz, a project that we're investing in, and it's project is going very well and the project will come on in a couple of years, but when you get to Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky's or Colorado, a few other places are also have very attractive investment opportunities that can deliver both higher returns and lower carbon.\nRodger Reed: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have 2 questions. The first 1 was, just thinking about the Balance Sheet, because of your conservatism on the way you manage your Balance Sheet, you've been able to make some counter-cyclical moves and Noble was obviously the most recent one. Given we're at the high part of the cycle now, could you talk about any plans to accelerate asset sales? I know it's not needed for the Balance Sheet, but it's interesting to hear whether you can -- there any opportunities out there. And if so, although they are across Upstream, Downstream, or Chemicals?  And then the second question is on Tengiz, it's good to see that the dividend come through after a number of years, are any loan repayments due in 2022? And then finally, just a quick comment and say thanks for the PCI calculation tool which you published. It's actually quite difficult to dig into some of those figures and understand all the variances. So I appreciate the transparency there.\nPierre Breber: Well, thank you Biraj for recognizing PCI. Our teams will be very happy to hear that. We wanted to make a tool that was transparent where you could use it for other companies because I know comparability is of interest to investors and so it's based on, again, transparent reporting data and comparability and so thank you for taking advantage of that and I encourage others to check it out. Let me just talk about TCO because as we look back, we had a very successful spring and summer campaign there. We hit our productivity targets and we achieved a lot of our milestones, and we had a full workforce. So we had a Delta variant wave which caused some higher levels of isolation in the middle of the third quarter.  But we ended the quarter with positive rates very very low and we're back to our full workforce. And as I mentioned earlier, we intend to maintain a peak manpower workforce level through the winter months. We have a vaccination rate over 85% for that workforce so we're well-positioned to make a lot of progress this winter. Now, we have to be thoughtful about it because it can get cold there. So we're sequencing the work in a way that we're saving a work that can be done indoors or in sheltered locations during the coldest month of the winter. So no change clearly in the guidance that we provided on second quarter in terms of budget and schedule, but I wanted to give an update.  Things are going very well in Tengiz and we're looking forward to a very productive winter season there. In terms of the dividend, you're right. It's the first dividend in 3 years, so that's nice to see. We did have a modest loan repay back that occurred last quarter. And look, we'll give guidance on 2022, just like with Paul's question, when we look forward. It will depend clearly also on oil prices, but that's something that will give guidance on our 4Q call. In terms of asset sales, yes, we acquired Noble when -- or announced the acquisition, when Brent was in the low 40s, and now Brent is in the low eighties.  And so, it's a commodity business, it has cycles, ups and downs, and when you buy or sell assets, timing makes a difference where you are in the cycle. And of course, strategic fit and all the elements were very, very pleased with the Noble transaction. We talked about, the timing of it, the first to do it, the synergies that we doubled, and the tax benefits that we saw this quarter and interest cost savings. So we did tender a number of bond offerings earlier this month. A lot of those bonds are Noble bonds, again, that was not included in our synergies because we weren't quite sure we can achieve that.  And we'll save over a $100 million in interest cost savings. So the Noble just keeps contributing to the Company, and that's part of the reason why we're a better Company now than we were several years ago. But it's a different market, so yeah, I view it more as a seller's market than a buyer's market right now. And so you're seeing us modestly increase some assets that don't compete for capital as well in our portfolio. In fact one of them is our position in the Eagle Ford. So that was a Noble legacy position, Chevron legacy was not in it. So we don't have quite the scale that we would like.  But again, essentially buying that position at $40, and now we have it on the market that's in the public domain. And obviously we expect to get much higher value than for what was implied in the purchase price. We have some other U.S. onshore assets that are on the market, again, that we feel are very attractive to a lot of industry players, but just won't compete for capital as well in our portfolio. Thanks, Biraj.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Hey, guys, good morning. 2 questions.\nMark Nelson: Morning.\nPierre Breber: Morning to you, sir.\nPaul Cheng: The first one is for Mark. Mark, you guys, tipped the Pasadena Refinery and that the time you are saying that it's one-off, because you complement your Pascagoula Refinery. There's a lot -- quite a lot of refineries that's available for sale in here. So I want to see with the substantial amount of the refining capacity being shot, does it change the way that how you are looking at that business or that you think you already have sufficient of the capacity and supplementary, and you really don't need to add? And also the end of retail marketing, some of your peers that have been aggressively that building up and including in the US. And you guys have a walk that business for more than 10 years. And is there any trend to going back, so that on the energy transition, including in the EV charger and all that? The second question is for Pierre. You talked about say the TCO dividend, how about Angola LNG, can you give us some idea that if the current commodity price fall? So we assume every year that both Angola LNG and the TCO is going to pay the dividend. And any cost sensitivity you can provide that you have to change in the oil price, how the impact on that dividend payout going to look like?\nMark Nelson: Alright, Paul, thank you for the questions. I'll take them, again, in reverse order. I think your second question was really about retail marketing. And as you know, we have 3 world-class brands, and we've taken a capital light approach to selling our branded fuels. In fact, 1 of the metrics that we often look at is the Opus brand power rating and we continue to be well at the top of that list. And what that means is the majority of our retail sites around the world that you would see are owned by retailers who has specifically chosen our brand. And so we have our brand, our fuel and generally not our capital.  We also happen to have one of the strongest retail convenience franchising offerings out there, extra mile that you've probably seen. In fact, I think we hit our 1,000th site, this year, with very very little attrition. And so we believe that our limited capital approach provides us the majority of the margin and sustainably delivered high returns, and still allows us to stay connected with customers. And as part of that offering to customers today, we have -- excuse me, EV charging stations in 7 countries around the world, and we're partnering with our retailers to continue to expand that offering as customers actually need it.  Your second question was, I think about the refinery portfolio in general and maybe Pasadena specifically. We're very pleased with our refining portfolio today. And it's really because of that hydroprocessing capacity that we have across our system. It gives us flexibility to deal with the fuels of the future and renewable fuels in particular, in a very, very capital efficient way, specific to Pasadena. Again, we have an opportunity there. The premise of the acquisition continues to hold for us in processing our equity crude, being able to supply our own service stations in the Texas-Louisiana area. And then of course, having the intermediate back and forth between Pascagoula and Pasadena.  That's all working as we would expect. And we've shared that we think there's an opportunity there to have very efficient expansion of light tight oil processing capacity, and we've hinted that that's going to be a hydro-skimming focus. We're working on that real hard and look forward to talking more about that next year. Thanks for your question, Paul. Now Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Yeah and on Angola LNG, so it's -- in our looking ahead flight Paul, we guide towards $300 million of return of capital. It's essentially a dividend, it just kind of an accounting characterization as it has returned to capital. It's cash, is the bottom align. And in terms of guidance going forward, and let me just say Angola LNG does sell into the spot market essentially both on oil link strips, and into Europe, TTF or international JKM markets. So it does have exposure, exposure to international natural gas pricing. 300 million will be a nice return on capital here in the fourth quarter.  And again, just like with Paul Sankey's question, we'll provide guidance for our full LNG portfolio on the fourth-quarter call for 2022. That will include Australia, Angola LNG, and our interest in Equatorial Guinea, which is again, it's another asset that was acquired through Noble Energy. Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: Hey, guys 2 questions. I'll ask them upfront. The first one is, I'd like to pick your brain on the mid-cycle chemical margins here. Historically we thought the mid-cycle would be more like $0.25, obviously right now we're more like 65. And even though you did say no, the margins will decline, some of the bigger chemical ethylene players that are out there saying, \"We will settle for the next 2, 3 years above the mid-cycle levels. \" So while the mid-cycle could be 25, you could still see 35 to 40. So that's the first question, and the second question is you seem -- you get into the CNG distribution for the first time. And I'm wondering if this is associated with the strategy of developing RNG and basically controlling the entire value chain so you can distribute your RNG that you're pretty -- going to produce through your distribution network.\nMark Nelson: Thanks, Manav got your question. So first on petrochemical margins, we indicated as we look to the longest of terms we expect pet-chem demand to continue to grow in line with the long-term GDP growth. We believe, in the next 4 to 5 years, we do see capacity growth in the next couple of years going past demand. Which brings us to towards the bottom portion of the margin cycle. And so I think we shared in our Investor Day discussions last year that we brought our view down and it's -- and again erring on the side of conservative and, perhaps, but that it was going to be $0.20 per pound in regards to where we could expect those margins over time, and anything above that, of course, we will take it.  And it drives us in our CPChem joint venture to make sure that we continue to work on our unit cost reductions, which they have done a very good job on and will continue to do going forward. And so we see that that is our number looking forward. And then I want to get to your comment on the R&G portfolio. You read it exactly correctly. Our close on the 60 American natural gas sites is really about us leveraging our strength. When we talked about renewable natural gas, we say a couple of things. We say it leverages our strengths and bio feedstocks are really important to strength in particular, our value chain activation, and partnerships.  And the 2 areas where you can see this at play, actually in the formal presentation, would be in the gas that's now coming from CalBio from all of the farms that we have there. And then our Brightmark activity experiencing their first delivered gas on the 60 CNG sites that -- American natural gas CNG sites with [Indiscernible], that allows us to follow the request of our customers, if you will. And we're trying to get the CNG to those customers throughout the -- our portfolio. And that's the first step in doing it in a platform for us to grow.\nManav Gupta: Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Manav.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. I may have missed it but, can you just discuss the drivers of why TCO is declaring this dividend now? And what we should look to assess if they will declare it next year, and just some background on how we could calculate that? And then my second question, just on cost inflation. What you're seeing across your projects, if it's impacting TCO at all, or any of your either large -- sorry, long-cycle projects or short-cycle in the Permian? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Jason. Yes. I should have mentioned, now TCO is paying a dividend. It was in the plan, but it could be higher than was planned, which is why we've guided to a range. Primarily because two things, one, clearly the macro-environment is stronger, so it is -- produces a light oil that attracts trades to a tight discount to brand and, with the fiscal terms and the rest of it, it's generating excess cash. And also we've seen at the project some real cost savings. Again, we've seen some deferrals, but that would be factored into retaining cash in TCO. But we've seen some underlying greater inefficient -- efficiencies and we've seen some foreign exchange benefits there.  So it's a function of it, things going well both from a market environment and from an execution of the project. Again, in terms of 2022, we will provide guidance on the fourth-quarter call like we have in prior years, we've guided historically to that cash flow line, which is the difference between dividends and affiliate earnings, I think we also might just give separately a range on expected dividends from Tengiz and other major affiliates. And then, in terms of cost, we're not really seeing any cost increases. Rigs -- U.S. onshore rigs are maybe creeping up, but they're still well below where they were pre-COVID and in general, the industry is operating below capacity.  So although there are pockets of goods and services that we use that are tied to the general economy, like steel and clearly steel is up. But the majority of our costs are tied to industry-specific major equipment, and that's still operating below capacity, so it could increase in the future, I know there's a lot of talk about it, but what we're seeing up-to-date is costs are well under control.\nJason Gabelman: Thanks.\nRoderick Green : I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call, please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Chevron's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-07-30 14:51:17", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session and instructions given at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green, please go ahead.\nRoderick Green: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations, and on the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream, and Pierre Breber, CFO. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Roderick. We delivered strong financial results in the second quarter, with the highest reported earnings in over a year. Adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion, or a $1.71 per share. The quarter's results included special items totaling $235 million, including a remediation charge in the Gulf of Mexico and pension settlement costs. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Adjusted return on capital was near 8% and we lowered our net debt ratio to 21%. Strong operating cash flow enabled us to meet Chevron's top financial priorities. Our dividend was up 4%. We continue to execute our efficient capital program and we paid down 2.5 billion of debt. Despite lower year-to-date prices and margins, first half 2021 quarterly average free cash flow is near 2018 levels, primarily due to lower capital and operating costs and contributions from legacy Noble assets. We're maintaining strong capital and cost discipline. CNE is down 32% from a year ago and we are lowering our full year organic CNE guidance to around $13 billion, primarily due to lower spending at TCO and greater capital efficiency across the portfolio. Operating costs are on track with our March 2021 Investor Day guidance of a 10% reduction from 2019. Adjusted second quarter earnings were up 6.2 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher prices in liftings. Adjusted downstream earnings increased on higher chemicals results, as well as higher refining margins and volumes. All other was roughly unchanged between periods. Compared with the last quarter, adjusted second quarter earnings were up about $1.5 billion. Adjusted Upstream earnings increased primarily on higher commodity prices and higher production in the U.S. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily from strong chemicals results, as well as increased refining margins and volumes. All other charges were roughly flat between quarters and are running ahead of ratable guidance primarily due to tax charges and valuation of stock-based compensation. The All Other segment results can vary between quarters, and our full-year guidance is unchanged. I will now pass it over to Jay.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Pierre. Second quarter oil equivalent production increased 5% compared to a year ago. The increase in production was driven by Noble acquisition and lower curtailments, partially offset by normal field declines, price-related entitlement effects, and asset sales. Turning to the Permian, we continue to incorporate greater efficiency into our activities. Even with our reduced activity levels, production is expected to be comparable to last year. Consistent with the guidance we shared in March, we're adding rigs and completion crews in the second half of this year, delivering an expected production rate of over 600,000 Barrels a day by year-end. For 2021, we expect free cash flow, excluding working capital, to exceed $3 billion assuming an average Brent price of $65 a barrel. We're committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our Permian operations. One recent example is our shift from diesel fuel to electricity, and natural gas to power drilling rigs and completion spreads. This reduces emissions, reduces well costs, and takes trucks off the roads. Which results in higher returns and lower carbon. At FGP-WPMP, overall progress is at 84%, with field construction 69% complete. We've recently reviewed our cost and scheduled targets. At this point, the net schedule extension from the pandemic is expected to be roughly a quarter for WPMP and two quarters for FGP. Our cost target remains $45.2 billion, as cost reduction efforts and favorable exchange rates offset an estimated $1.9 billion of incremental costs associated with COVID. The COVID costs include mitigation efforts, demob and remobilization costs, as well as the expected schedule extension I just mentioned. Although the total project cost target is unchanged, we have increased the project contingency to $1.9 billion, to recognize a schedule uncertainty associated with the virus and its variants. The project is currently at peak workforce and our primary focus is to mitigate the impact of the virus with vaccinations, testing, and isolation protocols to enable our workforce to achieve its productivity. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Ballymore project is being developed as a subsea tie -back to our existing Blind Faith facility. The project recently entered front-end engineering and design and remains on track for a final investment decision next year. Earlier this month, we sanctioned the Whale project, which has the potential for future expansion. Fabrication of the Anchor project remains on track with assembly of the production facility hall underway. In Australia, we have sanctioned the Jansz-IO Compression project, which will support the flow of natural gas to Barrow Island. Repairs to the Gorgon propane heat exchangers are complete, and we now have all 5 operated LNG trains online in Australia. In Colorado, our newest generation of production facilities have eliminated the tanks and flare system to deliver a carbon intensity of only 6 kilograms of CO2 per BOE. The new facilities also have a 60% smaller footprint, higher reliability, and 15% to 20% lower lifecycle costs than a traditional facility design, another great example of higher returns and lower carbon. Back to you, Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Jay. In May we closed the acquisition of Noble Midstream. With this transaction complete, we have fully integrated Noble and have achieved greater than $600 million dollars in synergies 3 months earlier than previously guided. We also started up a mixed feed cracker at GS Caltex and plan to be at 100% design capacity in the third quarter. The project was completed under budget and 5 months ahead of schedule. In the third quarter, we're resuming our share repurchase program at a targeted annual rate of $2 billion to $3 billion. This is the rate that we believe is sustainable through the cycle, while continuing to pay down debt. The restart of our program is consistent with our financial priorities and builds on our track record. We have a history of buying back shares consistently in meaningful quantities and at a price close to the daily ratable average over the entire 17-year period. We're continuing to grow lower-carbon businesses. This quarter, we started co-processing bio feedstock at our El Segundo refinery, growing renewable diesel production in a capital-efficient manner by leveraging existing infrastructure. We recently announced an MOU with Cummins to develop commercially viable businesses in hydrogen. Also, we've completed front-end engineering on a carbon capture project for emissions from the gas turbines in one of our California cogeneration facilities. This project leverages two innovative technologies; CO2 concentration, and carbon capture, and has the potential to scale across our full fleet of turbines. Finally, yesterday we announced the creation of Chevron New Energies, a new organization reporting directly to the CEO. This is an important step to build fast-growing, profitable, new energy businesses to further advance a lower carbon future. Now, looking ahead. In the third quarter, we expect major turnarounds to reduce upstream production by 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily at TCO, which also reduces our expected curtailments to about 5,000 barrels per day. We expect to make an incremental pension contribution in the third quarter of $500 million. This is a one-time payment in addition to our regular quarterly contributions. With higher operating cash flows, TCO expects to pay back part of its loans this year versus our prior guidance of increasing it's debt. There's no change in TCO's expected dividend this year. We've adjusted the guidance on the affiliate income line to reflect higher expected TCO earnings. Also, we expect higher dividends from CPChem in line with our share of higher earnings. On September 14th, we'll be hosting our Energy Transition Spotlight to provide more details on how we plan to lower carbon intensity in our operations and grow lower-carbon businesses. We invite you all to join us for this video webcast. Our objective is unchanged, higher returns, lower-carbon. During this quarter, we continue to make progress towards this goal, delivering stronger financial results and achieving important lower-carbon milestones. And with oil prices well above our dividend breakeven, and an industry-leading balance sheet, we will resume share buybacks, sharing part of the cash upside with our investors. With that, I will turn it back to Roderick.\nRoderick Green: Thanks, Pierre. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open up the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instruction] Our first question comes from Phil Gresh with J.P. Morgan.\nPhil Gresh: Hey, good morning, Pierre. I'm going to pick up where you left off there on capital allocation. You announced that $2billion to $3 billion buyback, which adds about $5 a barrel to your breakeven, which I think is about $50 inclusive of the dividend. Obviously, you want to have this sustainable plan. You've always talked about that. Oil's at 75 now. Help us put this in context. We have $15, $20 a barrel, extra oil price at this point, and your leverage is at 21% net-debt-to-cap. Do you want to keep driving down debt from here, or how are you thinking about things?\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Phil. By resuming the program, we'll now be 14 in our last 18 years that we have repurchased shares. So that's more than 3 out of every 4 years. And we're doing it at a level that allows us to continue to pay down debt. As you say, with prices above $70, our debt levels should head below the range I've talked about of 20% to 25%. That 20% to 25% net debt ratio range is really over the cycle, kind of implies prices between 40 and 60, like we talked about during our Investor Day, but again with prices well above that, we should head below the bottom of that range. In terms of the breakeven, I mean, this is our 4th priority from a financial perspective, and so it is -- we feel it's sustainable, we intend to sustain it over the cycle, but I don't necessarily view it as a commitment, like we would say our dividend is, and bake it into the breakeven calculation. But the last thing I'll say is, at our Investor Day we showed that at $60 flat Brent nominal over 5 years, we can generate more than 25 billion of excess cash. That's cash in excess of our capital and our dividend. And so you see us starting this buyback program at 2 to 3 billion a year, it shows that we have more than enough capacity to sustain that at reasonable prices.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, that makes sense. And then the second question, just on the Capex side of things. The billion dollar reduction, you said it was a combination of Tengiz timing and the efficiencies. Is there any further breakdown you could give of those two factors? I'm trying to think about how some of this might carry forward as we look at the longer-term 14 billion to 16 billion range you've talked about.\nPierre Breber: Yeah. Let me start, then I'll pass it over to Jay. We lowered our guidance for this year only to 13 billion. As you say, it's primarily due to lower spend at TCO, and part from work that's being deferred, and then greater capital efficiencies across the portfolio. I think you can view that as about 50-50, as a half project that's being deferred in half, greater capital efficiency. There's no change in our long-term guidance or guidance through 2025 of 14 billion to 16 billion. But Jay, maybe you could talk about some of the ways we're being more capital efficient.\nJay Johnson: It's really across the portfolio as Pierre said. But in particular, drilling and completion activities -- the Gorgon Stage 2 Project in Australia has been very efficient and gone ahead of plan from a cost standpoint. The Permian drilling and completion, and other U.S. shale and tight has been very efficient. And then we're seeing just overall good discipline on costs, making sure every dollar count, and it's really consistent with operating, and not only this COVID environment, but operating with a very disciplined mentality throughout the organization.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Phil.\nPhil Gresh: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research.\nPaul Sankey: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just a follow up if I could. You guys obviously have the megaprojects to Tengiz as an ongoing development. But the history of these megaprojects has been somewhat troubled by very high costs and Capex. Is Tengiz going to be the last megaproject, do you think? And beyond that, we'd be -- really be looking at the Permian as sort of a fragmented but mega development. Is that what we're looking at and is that how your Capex guidance that you just repeated, is that how that's setup, that we won't see another megaproject developed by you or perhaps by any major western oil? Thanks.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Paul. In the oil industry, you never say never. But look, we've talked before that as we move forward with the asset and the portfolio that we have, the preponderance of our capital, 60% and more, is going to be going into shorter-cycle higher-return projects, which are very quick to bring new production on. We have low pre-productive capital. They tend to be very efficient, and we can adjust based on market conditions and react quite rapidly. But that doesn't mean all of our investment will always be in just short cycle. The Deepwater continues to be an important part of our portfolio. It has very low carbon footprint and it tends to have high returns. And so we've seen projects like Anchor and Whale and Ballymore in the queue. And we'll continue to see those roll-in, but we're going to do that in a very disciplined way. We talked at the Investor Day about how we are taking action to make these capital projects more efficient, more effective. Going to the minimum facility objectives, and really building only what's necessary to deliver the returns that we're looking for. And I think that whole approach, as well as it being a relatively small amount of our capital, is going to lead to much more efficient and higher-return outcomes.\nPaul Sankey: Thank you very much, Jay. And then the follow-up would be, Pierre, how did you come up with the 2 billion to 3 billion of Buyback annually? Can you just talk about the parameters, maybe the oil price assumptions? Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Well, we're thinking of a range of oil prices. We -- I've said in the past, Paul as you know, that we would start a program when we were confident we could sustain it over the cycle through multiple years based on our confidence in excess cash flow and the strength of the balance sheet. And so you certainly consume that both of those criteria have been met. In terms of the level, it is to continue to pay down debt while we are having these prices. It's nothing really more than that. Again, as I said earlier to Phil's question, with prices above 70, our debt -- net debt ratio should be below 20%. And so this is a range that allows us to continue to do that. It also gives us a range to deal with uncertainty. We feel good about the macro, but undoubtedly there's the variants out there that can impact demand and you have OPEC+ still having curtailed volumes. So that flexibility is inherent in the range. It also gives us flexibility to buy more or less, depending on the strength of Chevron's stock price, which we've heard from shareholders who have said they want us to try to beat the daily average. I showed a chart that says, \"We don't buy high, we buy very close to daily average.\" But if we can do a bit better and use some discretion, we've heard from our shareholders that they'd prefer that, so that's the thinking that goes behind the level, the range, and the timing. \nPaul Sankey: Thank you, Pierre.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Good morning, everybody. Jay, I wonder if I could go to you first please. Maybe a small follow-up, to Paul\u2019s question. It seems to us that there's a lot going on in the Gulf of Mexico that's flying under the radar. You mentioned Ballymore, Whale, and Anchor; you've got Leopard -- you 've got a non-working interest in Leopard and Puma. And a few other things going on. And this obviously has been a legacy infrastructure area for you guys. Very efficient capital tieback opportunities and so on. I just wonder if I could ask you just to give us a quick update as to what your activity level is there and what your longer-term plans are, because it seems there's a lot more going on than perhaps you've laid out for the street at this point.\nJay Johnson: Well, the Gulf of Mexico has been an important part of our portfolio for a long time and it continues to be. We're one of the largest lease holders in the Gulf of Mexico. But importantly, what we've been doing is focusing our new lease acquisitions to primarily concentrate in those areas where we already have infrastructure. And as we've talked before, with our focus on returns, we're looking for those opportunities where we can do exploration and if we find something that's normal, it can be tied back into our existing infrastructure much like a Ballymore. If we find something that ends up really big and justifies the greenfield development, we can go the route of a Whale project where we continue to focus on the minimum functional objectives, building facilities that are replicative of nature, so that we are building on the learnings of the past. We've developed the Deepwater asset class, so we're taking learnings from the Gulf of Mexico, from West Africa, from Deepwater Australia, sharing those rapidly between these different asset groups to make sure that we're staying on the forefront of efficiency. We have an exploration program that's laid out. We keep that at a pretty low level these days so that it can be very efficient, very focused. We have a good resource base across the portfolio, but we're always looking for that next high-return, low carbon barrel. And the Gulf of Mexico represents a good hunting ground for that.\nDoug Leggate: Sorry, Jay. I don't mean to press you, but I mentioned a couple Leopard, Puma and I think you've got Silverback as well. Can you give us an update on those?\nJay Johnson: We will release information on those in due course. But at this point in time, we're not sharing information.\nDoug Leggate: Okay, thanks. Pierre, my quick follow-up is, plenty of cash-flow coming in, extraordinary capital efficiency, as Paul pointed out, not a huge amount of big projects in front of you. Well, what are you thinking currently on M&A? Because clearly, you did a fantastic job incorporating Noble. What's your latest thinking in terms of what [Indiscernible] and use of cash going forward? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Well, we're very happy with Noble. As we just said, we declared the integration complete, more than double the initial synergies, completed NBLX, we're the first to announce, first to close, quality assets, low premium, and done at a good time from an exchange ratio perspective. As you know, we're always looking, we have a very high bar and we certainly don't need to do a transaction. We just talked about our portfolio and how we can sustain and grow it in a very capital efficient way. Just the last thing I would say is, and we've shown this -- we don't really view cash as being something that's required to do M&A in our business with oil prices volatility, doing it on a stock basis as we did with Noble makes a lot of sense, it kind of keeps you hedged in case prices go up or down between the buyer and seller. So I wouldn't connect any kind of balance sheet actions as being an indicator one way or the other on M&A. We're going to be disciplined with our capital, it's all capital, whether it's organic or inorganic, and of course, we'll only take action if we see it in the interest of our shareholders.\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate the answers. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Hey, thank you. Jay, the first question is for you on Tengiz. Appreciate the update here. Can you just go through some of the modeling work that you've done to get to that $2 billion of contingency and give investors your latest read in confidence interval around the costs. It seemed like a good update relative to what was feared. And the summer is always so important in Kazakhstan. Just talk about the key things that you are going to be watching for over the next couple of months to ensure that you're on track.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Neil. I'll be happy to. At TCO, the team has just done an extraordinary job of responding to the impact of the virus. And as we said, we've been able to capture cost savings, which have largely offset, along with some of our foreign exchange gains, offset the incremental costs due to COVID. So at this point in time, we've reached our peak workforce on FGP, and so we are maintaining that workforce. It is something where we have to continue to stay focused on mitigations, particularly with the rise in the Delta variant and other variants that we are exposed to. The vaccination program continues to go well, we have 42,000 members of our workforce that have gotten their initial dose and about 30,000 that are fully vaccinated now and we continue to try and work with the Kazak government to increase those numbers. Because we were so successful in completing the fabrication, and that fabrication was done with such high quality, and it's been proven to be now dimensionally accurate, we've had our modules showing up at site within 1 millimeters to 3 millimeters of accuracy on where pipes land and the connections between modules. It's really helped us move forward from that standpoint. All of the modules going through the shipping program to arrive at Tengiz. They've all been successfully moved to site, restacked, and set on their foundations. We have that entire program behind us now. All the heavy equipment for the project has been set on foundations throughout the project, so our Heavy Lift Program is complete and being demobilized. And now we're just focused on the interconnections and the hookup and preparing for the turnover to completions and startup. So normally at this point we would be decreasing our contingency because we have eliminated so many of the traditional risks. But in this case, we've actually increased it to 1.9 billion and that's primarily due to our uncertainty around future impacts from COVID; this pandemic is far from over around the world and so while we're doing well and we've been very successful at mitigating any potential impact through this, as you said, critically important summer, we need to stay that way. We're monitoring our productivity. We're very focused on being capitally efficient here. Our focus is on delivering this project at $45.2 billion. We've allowed the schedule to slip a little bit because it's just too hard to try and catch up. We didn't feel that was a good use of resource, so our predominant focus is on the cost and we're managing the schedule within that cost parameter.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Jay. Following up here on the asset level, can you talk about how you see the cadence of activity in the Permian? You talked about exiting the year close to 600,000 barrels a day. Remind us where you are right now. And do you see the -- do you see the Permian still has a growth engine for you or are you planning on running the business more for free cash flow and with less growth in mind as we think about 2022?\nJay Johnson: In the Permian, we currently -- as you know, we scaled back activity significantly last year, and we've maintained a lower-level of activity. But at the same time, even with a constant level of activity, because the efficiency is getting better, we're actually getting more output from those reduced levels. We did add an additional completion crew in July, and we expect to add another one before year-end. Well, we currently have 5 drilling rigs out there, and we expect to add at least 1 or 2 more in late Third Quarter and Fourth Quarter. So we are seeing our activity levels start to increase in the second half as we see markets not imbalanced, but are starting to move in the right direction towards approaching equilibrium. We'll continue to monitor where we are in terms of the overall market signals that come to us. But we're going to continue to be very disciplined and focused. Our returns remain the number 1 objective. We are going to stay disciplined around those returns. But we are moving back into more and more efficient factory drilling again, as opposed to having to be focused on lease retention as we were over the last 18 months or so. So I think the Permian is going to continue to be a critical asset in our portfolio. What we've generated and demonstrated is that we can generate free cash flow while we continue to grow and that's because we maintain that disciplined focus on the balance as we look forward.\nPierre Breber: And Neil, in our earnings supplement, we -- a memo item, the Permian unconventional total production, so there's 577,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the second quarter. Thanks, Neil.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Pierre.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Hi, good morning, guys.\nPierre Breber: Good morning.\nJay Johnson: Good morning.\nPaul Cheng: 2 questions. In Permian, Jay, when you are looking at what you 're going to do in the next year or the next couple of years, how you -- whether that \u2013 the [Indiscernible] means that whether the market there's still fundamentally long supply or not, does it pay into your decision making process?\nJay Johnson: Well, I think, of course, it does. And that's because we're not just being triggered by an instantaneous price or some price threshold to signal a need for more activity. As we've talked about, as we gave you guidance at the Investor Day, we've given you our forward-look of the Permian with the expectations of how markets recover. Now, we've seen demand recover in the marketplace quite rapidly. And in most of the products, other than maybe international jet fuel, we are seeing demand starting to return to pre-pandemic levels. But the supply picture is still a fundamentally oversupplied world and that's why we're being cautious, we're being balanced, and we're going to continue to monitor the market, as we continue to decide how to ramp up our activity levels in the Permian. The Permian has very low carbon intensity, so it's a good place for us to continue to develop new barrels. Not only for us, but for the world, but it also has high returns for us. So it remains a key target for increased capital allocation. But we're not going to be driven by an output target or a production target; we're driven by the opportunity to make returns.\nPaul Cheng: Maybe let me just ask it in another way, Jay. If you determine next year the market is still fundamentally oversupplied, will you still grow the Permian production?\nJay Johnson: We've given you the guidance, we're going to continue to be disciplined as we have in the past and I'd rather not speculate beyond that, Paul. I've given you about as much as our thinking as I can.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. The 2nd question, I -- actually this is for Pierre. In the next several years, when you are looking at 14 to 16 billion a year in Capex, do you have a target percentage on how much you're going to spend in new ESG initiative and the business?\nPierre Breber: Well, yeah. We talked at our Investor Day about 3 billion in total to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow low-carbon businesses. That was through 2028, and in terms of updates to that, I'll wait and put another advertisement for our Energy Transition Spotlight. So that'll be September 14th, that will be webcast to everybody. We will go deeper into our actions to advance a lower-carbon future and we will have more to say then.\nPaul Cheng: Alright, thank you.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: Hey, guys. You and your partner recently SID the Whale. Can you help us with some more details, Capex, volumes, anything which will help us model the project a little better so you get credit for it in the estimates?\nJay Johnson: Thanks for the question. What I would say is we are not the operator. And so for those types of questions, we like to refer you to the operator is the best source of information for those types of things. I will say Whale is a really good asset. We're happy to invest in this project. We expect low carbon intensity from the action from this asset. We're looking for good returns. It's also based on many of the principles that we have been talking about for better capital efficiency. It's based on a minimum facility objective, where this facility is largely a replica of a previous Gulf of Mexico development. There was great cooperation between Chevron and the Operator to develop just what was the right balance between using exactly what was done before and what enhancements or innovation needed to be incorporated into the facility. So we're quite happy with this project and look forward to seeing it progress. But I'll refer you to the Operator for the details.\nManav Gupta: My quick follow-up here is, CPChem mostly was very strong in the quarter. My question is, at one point, you and Qatar Petroleum were actually looking build 2 JV crackers and then obviously the pandemic happened. And so how should we think about those crackers. Are -- is there a possibility they can be brought back on the table given the tightness you're seeing in ethylene chain margins or should we think about them as projects which might not be pursued ever?\nPierre Breber: We're continuing to advance those projects. And when I say \"we\", I mean our joint venture with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company in partnership with the Qatar, as you said. I'd say the Gulf Coast project is a bit ahead. SID was completed late last year, and then we're working together on determining the next steps, including when a final investment decision will occur. And we continue to advance the project and Ross to fund. They both are very competitive projects that work off of low-cost feedstock -- ethane feedstock. Their advantage, we think, relative to others around the world. At the same time, in Aveeno it is tight right now with strong demand, tight inventories in some of the carry-on effects from Winter Storm Uri. But we are seeing capacity additions coming on in the medium-term. And so Mark Nelson, our Head of Downstream, and his team are focused on having very capital efficient projects. So it's not enough to just have the ethane feed advantage, but it's having a really capital and cost efficient development. And that's what the teams are working on.\nManav Gupta: Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Manav.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, thanks for taking my question. First one's on Abgami. One of your peers highlighted a redetermination of the Abgami field in Nigeria, and you're a majority owner. There's actually limited details on this upside of the headlines, but would you be able to confirm whether this impacted you, or you had any change in ownership in that field, and whether there's any cash impact in the second quarter? And then I have a follow-up on a different topic.\nPierre Breber: Yeah, we won't comment specifically on that barrage. It's commercially sensitive, we've had a longstanding practice of not discussing commercially sensitive matters.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay, fine. 2nd question is actually just a more general question on inflation. Would you be able to talk about across services in raw materials and whatnot and what you are seeing -- any worrying signs of inflation across the portfolio?\nPierre Breber: We are not. We've talked in the past about isolated areas. I mean, for example, steel costs that go into our tubulars and our wells is up, but it's a fairly -- is a small component of a well cost, maybe about 10%. We certainly are seeing tightness in trucking services that has impacted us at time and some wage labor cost increases there, but I think there is more talk about it than we're seeing in terms of action. I'd say our COGS is pretty well under control in the upstream and downstream segments.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Thanks. Thanks, Biraj.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Richardson: Hi, good morning. Pierre, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about in terms of the new energy's business. Curious, as you go further down this road, and build out this business plan, you're seeing -- there just seems to be a consistent theme here, which is policy frameworks and different geographies and are they conducive to actually building a business? And so curious to your perspective on finding enough high return businesses that have the right market and policy framework today versus some of the things that you might have to wait on and just in the context of making sure you don't tie up some capital on some things that have some externality. So just curious on that point.\nPierre Breber: Well, we operate in California which has a lot of policy support in this area, and we have -- we're the leading downstream player here with a leading brand and have a large upstream business. But you're right, policy does vary, but there's enough policy to advance these businesses. Now, there are 2 main parts to our lower-carbon activities. The first is to lower the carbon intensity of our operations, and that's -- largely does not inherent on policy or at least certainly the first steps. We put out a 2028 target that has a 35% reduction to 24 kilograms per barrel, and that's something we're taking action on. And then we're also advancing lower-carbon businesses. The announcement yesterday was really focused on hydrogen carbon capture. Our downstream team is advancing renewable fuels, we've talked about renewable natural gas and renewable diesel previously. What we are trying to do around lower-carbon really is connected to our assets, capabilities, and customers. So one thing we're not doing in lower-carbon is large scale wind and solar. We're certainly having renewable power supply or operations again, part of lowering the carbon intensity, but not pursuing it as a standalone business. That's a decision that we're making because we don't feel like we have the competitive advantage. But when we get to renewable fuels, like renewable natural gas, renewable diesel, sustainable jet, hydrogen, carbon capture, these are areas that are adjacent to our business where, again, we have capability, we have customers, and we have assets that we can leverage. We sell to United Airlines. United Airlines is going to buy a sustainable jet. Sustainable jet is going to be a percentage of jet for some time period, 2%, 5%, 10% mix with conventional. We're the natural player in that space, so again, we'll share more on September 14th, but that's a little taste of what you should expect from us.\nStephen Richardson: Great, thanks very much. I appreciate the clarity.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jon Rigby with UBS.\nJon Rigby: Thank you very much. I think the question for Jay is you've referenced a couple of times carbon intensity around projects and I think your -- the operator on Whale highlighted it in the FID statement. I just wonder whether you could talk a little about that. I was struck actually by the comments you made in the prepared remarks around the Colorado very, very low carbon emissions by BOE. Few things, one is, can you talk about how you feature carbon emission profiles into your FID process at alongside traditional MPVs, IRRs, payback periods, etc. And secondly, whether as you look at your portfolio, as it stands right now, which obviously been built up over years and decades. Whether there's work that can be done around it that both source for lower carbon emissions and actually is, I think Pierre referenced, if you're adding renewables as a power source, whether you can actually also make an economic return as well, in conjunction with that.\nJay Johnson: Thanks for the question. A pretty broad question, so I'm going to start broad, but then I'll focus in on the Gulf of Mexico. In the upstream portfolio as we take stock of where we are as Chevron, our entire upstream portfolio, as best we can determine, sits at roughly half of the industry average for carbon intensity worldwide, so we're starting from a good position. We've been very focused on starting to bring our carbon down for some time now and so we set our initial goal back in 2016 for carbon intensity reduction for the upstream. Since 2016, we've actually reduced our flaring by 60% and our methane emissions by 50% and we've done that largely through what we call the marginal abatement cost curves. And just as we do in exploration, we don't have every business unit out there making their own independent decisions, but rather they bring their ideas for carbon reduction investments to the center, and then we look across the entire enterprise, not just upstream, but upstream and downstream, midstream, and we invest into those opportunities that give us the greatest carbon reduction for the least amount of capital. And that's in keeping with our focus on being a higher return Company. What we've been able to find so far is that the projects have been relatively low-hanging fruit. And so we've seen these big reductions in carbon that's occurred since 2016, and in fact, we reached our 2013 targets, sorry 2023 targets in 2020, 3 years ahead of schedule. And so we've already set new targets which we talked to you about at the Investor Day in March for 2028. And that's the path that we're working towards now, and that's to get down to an average of 24 kilograms of CO2 per barrel, equivalent across the entire portfolio. Places like the DJ basin, where some of the Noble teams have done a great job of designing out the parts of the process that have the highest emissions, have resulted in those huge gains. And so, as we said, not only are we seeing a 15 to 20% lower lifecycle cost, we're seeing high reliability, 60% footprint reduction, and they're down in the 6 kilogram per CO2 per barrel equivalent range, which is tremendous. To put that into comparison, the entire Gulf of Mexico, our operations last year in 2020, we're at 7 kilograms per CO2. And that's why we think it's so important there's good information for policymakers to understand that places like the Gulf of Mexico allow us to produce a very critical supply of energy to the U.S. and to the world, but also do that in a very carbon-efficient manner. In terms of our decision-making, these are all elements that we have to balance as we make investment decisions. But we are bringing these factors and these criteria into the equation as we evaluate where we are going to allocate capital and how we're going to move forward.\nJon Rigby: That's great. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. First on the buyback, if I recall correctly, last year, there was concern around what OPEC+ would do, and that factored into both your shareholder distribution strategy as well as your Permian production strategy. Are you kind of confident now that OPEC+ is going to continue to manage the market and did that factor in to your strategy or your decision to resume buybacks or were those kind of looked at independently? And then secondly, just a clarification on TCO FGP. Can you remind us what the free cash flow flip is from, I guess 2022, which is the last full year of project spend, to 2024 when the project is fully up and running? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Jason. I'll start with the second one. We haven't given asset level free cash flow guidance for TCO. You're absolutely right that you will see increased dividends from Tengiz, from our ownership interest in TCO, both as capital rolls off and as the project starts up. It's a big part of the Company's guidance of 10% annual free cash flow that's between now and 2025. A lot of that comes from the Permian, a lot of it comes from Tengiz. And as you also know, we'll get the loans repaid back. That shows up in a different part of the cash flow statement, but it's still cash. So there's nothing asset-specific that we've shared, but it's included in our overall free cash flow guidance that I'll refer you to our Investor Day. And perhaps as we get closer to the startup, we can share that in a more specific way for you all. In terms of the share buyback, again, we look at those criteria; are we comfortable we can sustain it -- confident we can sustain it over the cycle. There are uncertainties I cited, the Delta variant as an uncertainty and OPEC+. So if OPEC+ are going to take the actions that are in their interest. We don't have any greater insight into that. It is an uncertainty. But we have enough confidence in all the investments and assets that Jay has been talking about, the strong downstream in chemicals performance that we've seen, the economic recovery that we've seen, the discipline on the supply side that we've seen from the companies in this country and really around the world, that we feel good that we can keep this program in place for multiple years and also pay down debt while we're doing it.\nJason Gabelman: Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Jason.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. Maybe a quick follow-up on some of the balance sheet conversation from earlier. I know, Pierre, you said that this is one of those times that with the oil price where it is, you 're likely to trend below the 20-25% debt target -- net debt target. But is there a floor on the debt level in terms of the balance sheet where you start to feel like you're underlevered at some point either from an absolute debt level point of view, from a debt-to-cap point of view, or even from like an efficient retirement of debt point of view that would start to skew access cash more towards buyback or dividend growth?\nPierre Breber: Well, there is. I won't cite a number and it's because we don't have one internally. I mean, there's no hard and fast number, but undoubtedly, with the flexibility of our capital program, with the cash flow generation. I mean, the reason why that -- I've cited that 20% to 25% range, which is arguably higher maybe than we would have had at 5 years ago when we had a lot of long dated capital projects and you would have wanted -- we would have wanted and had, in fact, the debt level quite a bit lower because we had long dated commitments. We are, as we talked about earlier, getting to the -- near the end or a couple of years away from Tengiz being completed. The vast majority of our capital program is much more flexible. That gives us this higher range. I'd like to get comfortably below it. If you're asking the question, would we increase the share buybacks? Yes. That's absolutely possible. If we get our debt ratio comfortably below the 20%, and then we look out, again in terms of our cash flows, we can increase the range. We showed the history of our share buybacks. We haven't kept it at the rate that we've started it at. We've increased it. At times, we've decreased it, and so you'd expect us to continue to do the same thing.\nRyan Todd: Great, thanks. And maybe a separate follow-up on Energy Transition activities. You've continued to be fairly active in renewable natural gas. You've done a modest amount. I know you mentioned some co-processing and renewable diesel, or maybe we just don't have a lot of detail on it yet, but how are you thinking about the opportunity set as you look down the lines for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel? Would you consider doing something more meaningful, including the potential conversion of an asset or likely focus on smaller steps like coprocessing?\nPierre Breber: Well, again, we'll share more at the Spotlight. The co-processing that we just started -- it's a 2-stage process, so it will be up to have a capacity of up to 10,000 barrels a day by year-end. So we kind of brought on the first phase as another phase. We'll be the first U.S. refinery to co process through an FCC in the second phase, and again, that will give us the capability to produce up to 10,000 barrels a day. We did it this way in part because it's very capital efficient. We are leveraging existing kit; it's literally just a tank and some pipes. And so we can do this in a very capital efficient way. There's undoubtedly growth in renewable diesel on the demand side. There is also growth on the supply side. Renewable markets work in commodity markets just like the conventional products do. And so we're going to continue to be disciplined in how we approach it. And so this is a very competitive project, and I think you'll see more from us again when we talk about it on the Spotlight on September 14th.\nRyan Todd: Okay. Thanks, Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Thanks. How are you? Just one for me on LNG as an asset class in the context of low carbon. I'm pretty sure it would be below your target on a per unit basis, but gas prices are very high globally, LNG prices are very high. There's some opportunities out there in LNG and I'm just wondering on Chevron's official position on how that marries with your broader emissions targets.\nJay Johnson: Well, this is certainly a part of -- when we look at our portfolio, we consider the LNG assets and production to be part of the upstream. That's in all of the numbers that we've given you. And we continue to look for opportunities to make those operations more efficient and lower-carbon intensity. We think natural gas is an important fuel. It's an important transition fuel. It's going to play a critical role as the world continues to lower its overall carbon footprint. And so we are going to stay focused on incrementally increasing capacity of our existing facilities. We'll look at the opportunities to use existing oil age, or upcoming oil age in other facilities to increase our production through those facilities. But most importantly, we want to leverage the investments that we've already made to continue to focus on higher returns as we go forward. So it's a part of the portfolio, but it doesn't occupy any particular premium or special place.\nSam Margolin: Okay. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Sam.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning all. My one question is just really on protection. You guys in the past, you use interest rate swaps and other factors. Just wondering, there's a lot of discussion these days about hedges and all. I'm just wondering -- obviously, you've got a fantastic balance sheet where nobody worries on that side. But just wondering your policy and strategies, how you think about various protection, as I mentioned, interest rate swaps, hedges, all the above. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Well, on the commodity price side, we don't have, except for transportation, but we don't have flat price commodity hedges. And in terms of our debt, I mean, we tend to have a fair amount of variable debt or short-term debt, a commercial paper and others, but undoubtedly we also have some term debt that's fixed. I think our average interest cost is around 2%, our mix is probably less than half variable. But as you say, we have very strong credit, very strong balance sheet, and so we don't pay for a lot for insurance and we don't think our shareholders want that. I think our shareholders want certain exposure to commodity prices so they enjoy the upside and then they want us to maintain a strong balance sheet. Thanks, Neil.\nNeal Dingmann: No, absolutely. Thank you.\nRoderick Green: I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call today. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-04-30 15:04:03", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.\nRoderick Green: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. I am Roderick Green, General Manager of Investor Relations and on the call with me today is Pierre Breber, CFO. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Roderick. This quarter, we had our best financial performance of the last year as the global economy recovers. Reported earnings were $1.4 billion and adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion, or $0.90 per share. Included in the quarter were pension settlement costs and legal reserves totalling $351 million. Pension settlement and curtailment costs will be a special item going forward. For comparability purposes, 2020 adjusted earnings were recast to exclude these costs. Also found in the appendix to this presentation is a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. CapEx was down over 40% from a year ago and we ended the quarter with a net debt ratio of 22.5%. For the first time since the pandemic, cash flow from operations excluding working capital exceeded our cash CapEx and dividend spending. Cash balances ended the quarter slightly higher due to timing considerations. We expect cash balances to come back down later in the year. Free cash flow excluding working capital was $3.4 billion, up significantly from last year and higher than the 2019 quarterly average. With oil prices back up to around 2019 levels and downstream earnings still recovering, higher free cash flow this quarter is driven by the change in cash CapEx -- less than half of the 2019 quarterly average. Maintaining and growing our dividend remains our top financial priority. Earlier this week, Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.05 per share dividend increase, about 4%, that positions Chevron to extend our streak to 34 consecutive years of higher annual dividend per share payouts. Since 2005, Chevron's dividend per share has grown over 7% per year beating the S&P 500 and more than 4x our peer average. When our first three financial priorities have been met, we also have a track record of repurchasing shares, 13 out of the past 17 years. As we look forward, we expect to begin the repurchase of shares when we're confident that we can sustain a buyback program for multiple years through the oil price cycle. When making this decision, we'll consider the likelihood of future sustained excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet. Adjusted first quarter earnings decreased about $700 million versus the same quarter last year. Upstream earnings increased on higher prices and downstream earnings declined on a swing in timing effects and lower margins and volumes resulting from the pandemic. Both segments had negative impacts from Winter Storm Uri. Other was down primarily due to employee benefit costs. Compared with last quarter, adjusted Upstream earnings were up more than $1.4 billion due to higher prices. Downstream earnings increased primarily due to margins and timing effects, including the absence of last quarter's year-end inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million. Other was down in part due to employee benefit costs. Upstream production was down 3.5% from a year ago. The increase in production due to the Noble acquisition was more than offset by a number of factors including declines, asset sales, Winter Storm Uri, and OPEC+ curtailments. Winter Storm Uri impacted both our upstream and downstream businesses with earnings impact of about $300 million after tax in the quarter. All upstream production has been restored, and major downstream and chemical units have restarted. We also achieved first gas flow from the successful execution of the Alen Gas Monetization Project in Equatorial Guinea. This project allows gas from the Alen field to be processed through existing onshore facilities. Finally, the company announced an agreement to acquire all of the publicly held common units in NBLX. This stock transaction is expected to close in mid-May. We continued to take action to advance a lower carbon future. Last week, we announced an MOU with Toyota to work together to develop commercially viable, large-scale businesses in hydrogen. Also, we\u2019ve continued to invest in emerging low-carbon technologies, including announcing five venture investments this year in geothermal power, offshore wind and green ammonia. In addition, we're in the early stages of developing a bioenergy project with carbon capture and sequestration in Mendota, California. This plant is expected to convert agricultural waste biomass, such as almond trees, into a gas to generate electricity and sequester emissions of 300,000 tons of CO2 annually. Looking ahead, in the second quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia at Gorgon Train 3 where the planned turnaround and repairs of propane vessels are underway. The impact from OPEC curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan, the FGP project recently placed the final module on its foundation. Remobilization of the construction workforce achieved about 95% of the end of first quarter objective. Further workforce additions are expected this quarter. In summary, it was a good quarter with our strongest financial performance in a year, continued progress towards advancing a lower carbon future and a dividend increase while maintaining an industry leading balance sheet. During last month's Investor Day, we shared our goal of higher returns, lower carbon. This quarter was another step in that direction. As we look forward to the next few quarters and the world gets better control of this virus, I'm confident that we will continue to deliver stronger financial performance and help advance a lower carbon future. With that, I will turn it over to Roderick.\nRoderick Green: Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We will do our best to get all your questions. Katie, please open up the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Our first question here, maybe just a housekeeping item on the numbers. Can you provide a little more color on the moving pieces for cash flow this quarter? It came in a little below street's expectations. And I guess if we're doing it right, we apply your cash flow sensitivity per dollar change and brand. And we're still coming up with a higher cash flow number than reported despite winter storm Uri. So we're just wondering if we're missing any other one offs other than the pension settlement since I know there was a lot going on this quarter.\nPierre Breber: Yes, thanks. Our dividend break even in the past couple of quarters with weak downstream margins has been around $50. It was a little higher this quarter. There was nothing operational except winter storm Uri, it's really primarily due to some non-operational items like accruals for legal reserves and taxes. Those are non-cash in the quarter. But when we look at cash flow excluding working capital, of course, we're taking out that working capital effect. So those kinds of accruals which are charges result in a lower cash flow ex working capital. Point out though that our free cash flow in the first quarter 2021 was higher than free cash flow in 2019, even though 2019 had much stronger downstream margins and similar oil prices, and that's primarily because of the cash CapEx. So I think you're doing the calculation, right. The tricky thing about these cash flow breakeven is you don't hold everything else constant, all the other margins and indicators, and then some of these timing effects on accruals.\nJeanine Wai: Okay, great. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe my second question on the buyback and free cash flow. So on our projections, we see pretty strong near term free cash flow, and the trajectory, it really meaningfully steps up in 2024, 2025, with Tengiz and some of your long cycle [GoM] [ph] projects starting up in the Permian. So I think to us this suggests that for the buyback, it makes a lot of sense to leg into a program, kind of similar to what you did in '18 and '19, versus a consistent amount per year, which I think was the last commentary before the pandemic, which I know changed a ton of things. So can you provide any thoughts on how you envision the buyback getting reinstated?\nPierre Breber: We have a track record of buying back shares pretty consistently, 13 of last 17 years, over $50 billion of buyback since that time, at an average price in the mid 80s, less than $1 higher than the ratable price that would have been in for every single day during that whole time period. As I said on the prepared remarks, when we start a program, if and when we start a program, we'll want to sustain it for multiple years, because we want to get it through the commodity price cycle. Shareholders feel differently about buybacks, there's a concern that we only buy back when our share price is high. That's a perception. That's not the reality, because I just shared with you the actual numbers. But that's the perception that we have to deal with. So the common ground we find is, when we start a program, have confidence that we can sustain it for multiple years. And we're going to look to those two factors, the likelihood of future excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet to weather a down cycle and oil prices that we know is going to happen. So we're not yet on a sustained global economic recovery feel very good about where we are here in the United States and several other countries, but there are a number of countries where they're still working to get control of the virus. And so we think it's appropriate so we increase the dividend, which is consistent with our financial priorities. We don't need -- we're not going to increase the capital this year and we have tight guidance out five years we have the balance sheet in a very good place. So yes, in the short-term, any excess cash is going to go to the balance sheet. But over time, excess cash will be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividends like you saw us announced a couple days ago and in the form of buybacks over time.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Good morning, Pierre, Roderick and congratulations on your first earnings call. I wonder Pierre, if I could just hit what might be the 800 pound gorilla in the room, which is the acquisition of Noble. The production seems to have kind of disappeared in the mix. And it's raising some questions, at least from people we speak to about whether Chevron is under investing to sustain long-term production capacity, what would your response be to that?\nPierre Breber: We're not under investing. We showed during our Investor Day that we're very capital efficient and at our $14 billion to $16 billion. We in fact, we're going to go production around 3%, [or not] [ph]. That's the thought and ambition of us to have production growth as an outcome of what's a very capital efficient program. Jeanine mentioned, we're investing to increase production at Tengiz. We don't have that production. Now, that's $2.5 billion in the budget at Tengiz. So we have our eye on long-term value through this whole crisis. If you really step back to when this started about a year ago, we did hit short-term capital pretty hard. We kept our eye on long-term value. We didn't see the virtue and investing capital to add short-term production in a world that was going to be oversupply for some time period. And arguably still is with OPEC+ barrels constrained. And again, we're not back to a full sustained economic recovery. But we preserve the options on long-term value. I'm very cognizant that we have a dividend obligation, we're one of the few companies that didn't cut the dividend, we're the only company that's increased the dividend, and really a dividend increase that averages 6% per year during a very difficult time. And we show during our Investor Day, that we have the capability to grow free cash flow 10% per year over five years. And that's coming from Tengiz, which we'll see in a couple of years and growth in the Permian when the world needs the barrel. So we're not going to chase short-term production, we don't see value in that. Our production guidance for this year is unchanged 0% to 3%. You saw our reserve replacement numbers, the Noble acquisition, undoubtedly, has helped. Remember, we showed and Mike showed at the last quarter call that we've invested actually the same amount that we expected post-COVID as pre-COVID, pre-COVID, we would have said $20 billion a year for last year and this year, about 40 billion. Organically, we're only going to do about 13 or 14 each year, that when you add in the 12 or 13 from Noble or is it exactly where we were pre-COVID. So we are not under investing. We have to sustain and grow the enterprise. But we're doing it in a very capital efficient way.\nDoug Leggate: Appreciate the answer. Pierre, my follow up is actually related to CapEx. So I guess a quick one, but you are obviously running well below your run rate for the year, is that the timing issue. How would you expect the cadence to look over the balance of the year? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Yes, thanks. It is really timing. I mean, first quarter is normally a little light, winter storm Uri obviously you're not drilling wells when you're shutting in production and dealing with the challenges of that extraordinary winter event. And then, there is just timing of some major capital projects that are more back end loaded. So no change to our guidance of a $14 billion organic program, we saw a small inorganic acquisition in the first quarter numbers. So that can be different going forward. But from an organic perspective, we're going to stick with the budget. We are running a little low, as you say, we think we'll end up pretty close to the budget by year end.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh: Hey, Pierre. My first question here is actually a bit of a follow up in the cash flow in the quarter. There was a $500 million headwind from affiliate cash flows in the quarter and the cash flow statement. And in the last quarter call, you had given a guidance for the full year of 0 to 500 million headwind. There was not an update given in the slides this time. So I was wondering if it was just front loaded, or if there's any change to that. And I recognize the affiliates also can tie into the Tengiz co-lend. So has that guidance changed, either? Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Yes, thanks. So we didn't change our guidance, because it's just early. I think you're right. I think you're inferring that the guidance, in particular for Tengiz will get better. We gave a co-lending guidance of $1 billion to $2 billion. Right now, we'd be at the low-end of the range. And frankly, we could be at zero depending on if prices stay where there are right now. So you should expect us to update that guidance at mid year when we see a little more time with commodity prices, but clearly Tengiz when we have prices over $60, that reduces the need for co-lending and might not require any. And again, you could see a dividend out of Tengiz that's a decision for the TCO shareholders to make but we have not had a dividend now for I think, two or three years and so that would also be positive. In terms of affiliates, I mean, that cash flow line again, the difference between earnings from affiliates and the dividends, the dividends were about flat between fourth quarter and this quarter. So that's not a variance on the cash flow. But you're right that that there's some timing in that some of the Winter Storm Uri effects kind of factor into CPChem. Again, we'll update that guidance when we get to mid-year.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. And then, the second question is on Tengiz, you're obviously continuing to ramp the headcount. I think at this point, most investors are assuming some kind of delay in the startup timing as well as impacts to costs from that potential delay. Kind of hard to overcome maybe a timing delay. But is it possible that you can still, in your mind, be able to do this within budget, even with the timing delays? I recognize you haven't given an official update here. But I just want to get your latest thinking. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Yes, thanks. So let me just take us back or start with the Investor Day. We were at 22,000. We remobilized to 25,000, just short of our 26,000 first quarter objective. Then, you saw where we plan to go in the second quarter. And we're excited also, big milestone was getting the last of 86 modules on two foundations. So we're still making very good progress. We are managing through a pandemic, we have all the safeguards in place. They're working. We have a very low rate of positive cases right now. We've also started a vaccination program at Tengiz. It includes both the project and the producing operation staff. So it's not just for the project also for the base operations. We've been allocated about 10,000 doses administered already 7000. Future vaccinations, though, will depend on more allocations from the Republic of Kazakhstan. This is not a company program we're doing it with the government and are allocated by the government in Kazakhstan. So to answer your question, and at this time, there's more pressure on schedule than costs. We have a backlog of work because of the demobilization last year and having to isolate work teams at times when we do have a positive case. It's possible but hard to fully make up the schedule. We also have incurred higher costs as a result of COVID. We've had some cost efficiencies and some foreign exchange benefits that may be able to offset the higher costs. So as we've said in the past, we need to demonstrate that we can remobilize, fully remobilize stay at full numbers, meet productivity targets and achieve our milestones while managing through a pandemic. And the spring and summer work campaigns are very important to give us the data that will help us get a reliable update on cost and schedule.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: My first one is a follow up on some of the production questions from earlier and it relates more specifically to the Permian. And I think one of the things that stood out in your recent Investor Day was the fact that even at a much lower capital spending level, you were still able to achieve a similar level of growth in the Permian, over the next few years differed slightly versus pre-COVID plans but still attractive growth there. As you think about the resumption of activity to facilitate that growth here over the next few years. Can you talk a little bit about the cadence and timing or from a market standpoint, what signals in terms of oil prices or otherwise that you need to see, to begin increasing activity there to resume that planned production ramp?\nPierre Breber: Yes. We've been focused on three metrics, three conditions. So again, oil prices are going to move up and down. We're focused on the fundamentals, we look into three indicators. The first is, is the global economy on a sustained path to recovery not quite there yet clearly optimistic here in the United States with high vaccination rates on the stimulus package, a few other countries, but again, a number of countries don't have control of virus. So we need to get on a sustained path of economic recovery. The second is, we need to see OPEC+ barrels. Get back into the market. We're starting to see that we need to have clarity on what actions are going to take, but there's still a lot of production that is being curtailed. And then, the third and I think the third condition has been largely met, it's inventory -- are back to near normal. And so the inventory surplus for the most part has been worked off. So I'd say one of the three conditions now, that's for us to increase CapEx, not this year, our budget is fixed this year, $14 billion, but within the $14 billion to $16 billion 5 year guidance that we talked about. So we're still talking about a modest, a modest increase. In terms of the Permian, everything is going very well there. The first quarter production was clearly impacted by Winter Storm Uri, that's about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, for the quarter. But if you take that out production, I think, looks good. Our declines we shared last second quarter, Jay shared that production could decline 6% to 7%, if we stayed at low activity levels, it's probably a little bit better than that it might be closer to 5%. But undoubtedly, we're at the low investment levels that we're doing right now. We'll see some declines. That is okay. That is the correct response to an oversupplied market, particularly again, when we're keeping our eye on long-term value. So what you could see later this year is we could bring right now operated we have five rigs to completion crews, our net non-op is a similar rig count. Certainly, we could bring back a completion crew later this year. And that would help us produce some of our drilled and uncompleted wells. But in terms of getting on the trajectory that we showed at our Investor Day, there's still time I mean that outlook kind of factored in, that we would still be in this kind of not full recovery at this point in time. And then, it ramps up, over the next year and the year after that. So can we do it faster? We absolutely can. Can we hold it where we're at here longer if necessary? We can it's very flexible. It's the appropriate response, but the long-term value and the point I think of your question, is there, right, the million barrels a day that we showed in 2025. But more importantly, highly accretive to returns, strong free cash flow, right, free cash flow positive last year, growing free cash flow. So it's a fantastic position we have. We were advantaged because of the royalty. We intend to invest in there but we're going to do it at the right time.\nDevin McDermott: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And as we think about decarbonization energy transition and returns, I think you've had a very thoughtful approach on that and focusing on returns, enhancing investments, decarbonizing your existing portfolio, integrating renewables in the portfolio has been one of the pillars there. You've had some progress here over the past few months in both venture activities, you highlighted in the slide, the hydrogen MOU. And my question is, you've seen some of your peers in the industry form new business ventures focus specifically on commercializing technology and scaling up new business opportunities to hopefully become growth engines, over time returns enhancing growth engines. Can you talk a little bit more about Chevron strategy for transitioning some of the investments and opportunities available to capture so far into new growth ventures over time, including in a monetization strategy or scaling strategy for some of the venture investments that you've talked about here, in your prepared remarks.\nPierre Breber: Yes. Well, you summarized our strategy pretty well, I'll hit it really quickly. The first is to make the oil and gas that we produce as low carbon as we can. We put out 2028 targets that have a 35% reduction. We think we're top quartile. We will stay top quartile. And we showed a slide that say we go beyond that and get the carbon intensity down into the mid teens in terms of kilograms per barrels of oil equivalent. So that's the first. That's really done in the segments. That's really where the work gets done. The second is to increase renewable energy alongside our conventional products. So renewable natural gas sold along with conventional natural gas, renewable diesel sold alongside our conventional diesel you seen, we're going to co-process at our LA refinery later this year biofeed along with conventional feed and make renewable products, have renewable diesel biodiesel and more than half of our service stations in the United States. So good progress there. And then, the third is to grow low carbon businesses. And that's exactly that's hydrogen carbon capture, the venture investments are important. And they are really making sure we're staying connected to all the latest technology. But we intend to do exactly what you say is grow these businesses. So let me talk about project Mendota in California. We're in partnership with Schlumberger and Microsoft. It is going to capture the emissions from agricultural waste, so they burn almond trees after a certain number of productive seasons. Normally, those emissions just go to the atmosphere, this project would capture those emissions, converted into a synthetic gas that can then generate power and use that power to compress the CO2 and inject it in the ground and then sell excess power into the grid. And that's a project that's now front-end engineering and design. We're looking at another Carbon Capture Pilot with Savante in Bakersfield. So the venture investments is an enabler to growing hydrogen and carbon capture business. That's exactly what we intend to do over time. These are nascent businesses require lots of partnerships but we're going to be a player in it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: So, the first one is just on Gorgan. Pierre can just talk about the state of play there, it sounds like Train 3 is going down and in the back half year, you're going to be running closer to nameplate capacity. But just to talk about maintenance there and where we stand with the project.\nPierre Breber: Yes, Neil, it's pretty straightforward. We're doing our the scheduled Train 3 turnaround, separately, or it turns out and at the same time we're able to do the repairs. We expect that to be completed by the end of this quarter. And then, you're right, we'd be operating all three trains in the second half of the year. There was a short -- there was a time period in the first quarter where we saw all three trains operating between the train one turnaround and the start of the train three work. So we know what those units can do and we're excited to get back to it here in the third quarter. Wheatstone will have a planned turnaround late third quarter, early fourth quarter, but again, we expect Gorgon to be running full during the second half of this year.\nNeil Mehta: Pierre you guys have been really good at M&A. Being opportunistic, willing to step away when the bid went away from you and taking in assets like Noble towards the bottom of the cycle. It's a core competency for Chevron. As you look at the landscape, how do you think about M&A and whether there are opportunities out there and how are you evaluating that?\nPierre Breber: Neil, we're really happy with the Noble acquisition. Again, if we step back and think of July, it was still an uncertain time and announcing -- being the first to announce that major transaction closing first in and October, having now two quarters where we've been integrated, seeing everything we said the free cash flow accretion, the returns accretion, earnings accretion. The synergies doubled from 300 million to 600 million, achieved 80% of them, we'll get the rest before the year end. Very happy with the talent from the Noble employees that have come across DJ basin and the Eastern Med. So again, what was a very good deal looks even better now. Now, look, it's a challenge to obviously replicate that, we will always be looking, we have a very high bar, Noble, got over the bar with the quality assets and the value that we saw. We don't need to do an acquisition to Doug's earlier question. We are sustaining and growing this enterprise. I'm very cognizant of that. And again, we need to do that to sustain and grow the dividend. At the same time, there's times inorganic, can enhance the company. And so, if we see something that will make that Investor Day story, we told even better, then we'll pursue it. I do think industry consolidation will continue. Undoubtedly, valuations have moved from back where we were in July. We know it's a long game, we're very patient. And again, we don't need to do a transaction.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Pierre, two questions, first, among your peers that I think you have probably the happier concentration in California. And with the governor latest proposal, how that may impact your overall operation or how you may restructure yet or if you do need to restructure yet. So I want to see that, how you guys thinking about the policy impacting on your business in California, both in the downstream and upstream? The second question that if we look at some of the smaller [indiscernible], in the last [indiscernible], in the last 12 months, I think one of the movement is into the variable dividend, which is never attained for the major oil companies such as you guys. You guys always use the share buyback. So just curious that internally that have the board and management even consider the variable dividend versus buyback to see which is a better way to return cash to their shareholders.\nPierre Breber: I'll answer your second question, first. Of course, we pay close attention to what everybody does. We have not been convinced that there's a better cash return story than what we do, which is a steadily growing dividend, again, with a 4% increase announced 34th consecutive year of growing dividends, 7% compounded rate for the last 15 years. And a ratable buyback program 13 out of 17 years very close to the actual ratable price during that whole time. So we talked to our shareholders all the time. I think our shareholders support our framework. But of course, we'll keep an open mind, but we don't see the value in it. Look, I think those approaches are gaining favor, in part because dividends have been cut by other companies and other actions that have not been as consistent as predictable and as reliable as what we've done over that track record of 34 years on the dividend and 17 years on the buyback. If we go to California policy, there's -- I'm not sure exactly which one you're referring to there's an internal combustion. I don't know if it's a ban or a rulemaking proposal to reduce that. But I think 2035 there's also a governor requested the rule makers to look at rules on hydraulic fracturing. What I can say is that, certainly on hydraulic fracturing has been done safely in California under comprehensive regulations for a long time. It's been done safely elsewhere in the United States and safely all around the world. And I think when policies restrict supply, it just moves energy production to jurisdictions that likely have less regulation. And it also moves the jobs and the government revenues and increases the trade deficit. And I'll say the jobs in oil and gas are good paying jobs you can raise a family on. So in terms of our operations, if some sort of hydraulic fracturing ban was implemented through the rulemaking process, it would not be material to Chevron's upstream operations in California. It impacts future drilling at a field that represents less than 10% of our production. Of course, we'll work with Governor Newsome though to make those rules, as you know, advanced the environmental objectives while continuing to support the jobs and the economic benefits of our industry. In terms of any kind of internal combustion engine ban, what I'd say is, we support the Paris Agreement, we support a price on carbon. Light passenger vehicles represent less than 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. So let's make sure we also focus on the other 90%. But if you want to look at to EVs and transportation put a price on carbon and let the technologies compete in the marketplace. Thanks, Paul. We'll go to the next question.\nOperator: We'll go to Ryan Todd with Simmon Energy.\nPierre Breber: Hey, Ryan, are you there? Katie?\nRoderick Green: Could we go to the next caller please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Couple of things, I'd like to follow up on more look back and look forward. Gorgon in the first quarter, we had some fairly significant gas prices, you're typically more contracted than spot market. I was just wondering how that performed at a time where you were -- probably weren't able to participate much in the spot market. It was just curious how you covered the contracted side and how you think about that a little bit going forward. And then the other question I had hasn't gotten much play recently, but as part of the curtailments within OPEC+ how the neutral zone restart is going with the impacts are there for you.\nPierre Breber: Sure. So on Australia, we've said that with one train down at Gorgon, which has been largely the case since mid-year last year. If you think of our Australia system is having five trains and so four out of five trains have been operating that lines up pretty closely with our contracts. So it's not an exact match, because some of the Wheatstone contracts and Gorgon contracts are a little bit different. But fundamentally, we're balanced. So yes, we the real opportunity costs from the Gorgon downtime was not participating in the spot market. So we didn't get the benefit of a relatively balanced, there were some trading puts and takes I would say in the LNG spot market, but nothing worth pointing out. In terms of PV that ramp up continues very well. It's at 60,000 barrels a day. Our share pre the shut in was about 80,000. So we expect to get there here during the course of the year. And then, of course, any OPEC+ curtailment at this point in time -- it's not being curtailed, but that's really subject to the local governments.\nOperator: We will go next to Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: Hey, guys. I just quickly want to focus on two questions on the California project. The first one is because you are sequestering and storing in California. Does that mean that on top of IRS 45 Q credits, you also get the LCFS credits, because if you're not storing in California, as I understand, then LCFS is not available. And the quick follow up there is, why almond tree, is it only because the carbon intensity is minus 80? Or is it also because it's just you and one more guy chasing that feedstock? So what we're seeing in the soybean oil market that doesn't replicate. So if you could tell us why almond tree as a feedstock?\nPierre Breber: Yes. Well, let me just step back for a moment. Just remember, we're just talking about transportation. That's the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions globally, right. The first is manufacturing, second, power generation, third is agriculture and land use and then fourth is transportation. So agriculture and land use is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions, you've seen our work in renewable natural gas, which again captures the methane from dairy cows and so that's a worthwhile area for us to look into. So the agricultural waste is just -- that's what happens is, it gets burned and those emissions go to the atmosphere. And so partnering with Schlumberger and Microsoft, that's a worthwhile project to capture and emission that otherwise we've ended the atmosphere -- emitted to the atmosphere and converting it and sequestering, essentially and generating some excess power. So it's early days. You're right. It's all policy enabled, including federal policy and California state policy. We're doing the front engineering a lot of work to do. But I think you're getting the -- the right idea is that we're looking for projects that are higher return lower carbon. And so this is a project I mean, generated return with the policy support, and reduces carbon.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy.\nRyan Todd: Sorry about that. My phone, the call dropped right as you were asking me a question. Maybe if I could follow up on one of the earlier questions in terms of the research into the buyback, I think you walk through two of the things that you needed to see which is sustainable excess cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet, you mentioned, the near term cash goes onto the balance sheet is that because it's just the place to hold the cash while the sustainability gets to a level of confidence that you're okay with or is that because you actually feel like the balance sheet needs to be strengthened a little bit more before you restart the buy back.\nPierre Breber: It's a bit of both. I mean, it's just how the math works, right? If you have excess cash, and you don't change your capital program, the dividend will just increase, so that's not going to change. So just by definition, it goes to the balance sheet. But it also, I think you can infer in my comments, that, again, we're looking to future excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet to weather, the commodity price cycle. So I'm not going to give you a hard target, we're going to use judgment, because there's judgment on future excess cash generation, this is our first quarter actually, with current excess cash generation. We expect the next couple quarters to be potentially even better, because you've got oil prices above 60, refining and chemicals margins much stronger. So it could be even better. At the same time, we don't have a sustained global economic recovery. So it's reasonable for us to be cautious, we want to be confident that when we start the program, we're going to continue it for multiple years. And we can sustain it through an oil price cycle. So I know that folks want a formula or a trigger, I know some of our competitors have those numbers, we're going to use judgment. And we're going to consider what we see in front of us in terms of the likelihood of future excess cash generation, we're going to want the balance sheet in a strong enough position that if oil prices cycle down, we can continue the buyback program relying on the balance sheet. our balance sheet is very strong right now. But yes, in the short-term, excess cash is going to go to the balance sheet. That's kind of by definition, but it also serves a dual purpose of lowering our net debt ratio and putting us in a better position for when we start if and when we start a buyback program.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. And then, maybe on a separate topic, if we talk a little bit about refining. I know you don't comment on news headlines. You mentioned recently in a news article connecting to a potential refinery acquisition in the U.S. north northwest, you did acquire a refinery in recent years. Can you talk about how you think about your portfolio exposure on the downstream side in general, appetite for increasing or reducing that exposure in any way and how your general view of the refining outlook over the medium term may play into, how you look at managing your portfolio?\nPierre Breber: Yes, so again, I won't comment specifically on that report. The refinery in the Gulf Coast is very small acquisition that we made was something that I had foreshadowed, I was leading the business at that point in time, because we'd only had one refinery in the Gulf Coast region, we were, I think only company really major company with that setup, we did not -- we were on the eastern side of the Gulf Coast in Mississippi. And so our retail in Texas was supplied by third-party barrel. So we had talked about that, we didn't have to do that. But when the opportunity came and that transaction is kind of working, as we envision. So on the West Coast, we're a much different place. We have a two refinery system, we have a leading brand, really strong infrastructure. We're growing a little bit in Mexico, some of our retail volumes there. So I just say we're in a strong position on the West Coast. And in the Gulf Coast, we were also strong, but we felt we could make us even better by getting something on the eastern side and the Texas side. And we did that so I wouldn't read too much into it. We did in a small Australia retail fuels, which again was enabled our value chain out of Asia. So there's been some very targeted modest acquisitions in the refining business and retail business. But for the most part, that we have a focus, geographic footprint, very competitive business. As we look forward look, it's going to get better Winter Storm Uri is difficult as that event was for everybody in the region. One of the outcomes was it tightened inventories for fuels and especially for chemical. So those margins have recovered a little more quickly than they otherwise would have. And we think the next couple quarters are going to be good. And we're well positioned in our downstream and chemicals business.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: I guess following up on the downstream, since that's being discussed. Can you just comment on specifically your markets, you're focused on California and kind of the Asia Pacific region? And it seems like vaccine deployment and return to normalcy is kind of lagging there. So when you look across your portfolio, do you see kind of different pace of margin improvement and returned to normal and do expect your refining results to reflect that throughout the year? And then, secondly, on the Toyota MOU, you announced there was a comment in the press release, mentioning that the MOU in the pursuit of hydrogen will leverage existing market positions and assets that Chevron has, can you maybe elaborate on that comment a bit? What market positions or assets are -- or at least the types of market positions and assets that the MOU will leverage? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Yes, Jason, I'll be real quick on the second one, because it's early days, it's an MOU, it's really to explore this alliance is to work together to grow the hydrogen business, in passenger vehicles and heavy duty. You'd expect that the focus would be around California, which makes sense. And the reference to assets is like hydrogen, fuel dispensing at some of our service stations. So that's the comment more to come. We're very excited to partner with a great company like Toyota on the fuel cell technology. And you'll hear more over time. In terms of the regional differences, you're absolutely right. There are regional differences. If I contrast first West Coast and Gulf Coast, actually Gulf Coast is a little bit stronger, Florida looks really pretty much back to normal. West Coast, on track with gasoline and diesel really is come on strong. Now the Southern California resurgence, earlier this winter has worked its way through, the rates are very low. And you're seeing that come back to travel strong, again, in the Gulf Coast region, seeing it come back in California, with a little bit weaker we're seeing on the West Coast is because the big airports in San Francisco and LA are such -- are so heavy for international travel that clearly is lagging. Now, hopefully it's coming soon after domestic travel, we saw the announcement in Europe that fully vaccinated Americans could go to Europe this summer. So we'll just see, that's hopefully not too far behind. We saw in China and Australia that domestic travel fully recovered once those countries got their arms around the virus. So I'm confident domestic travel will come back very quickly here in this country. But again, international travel will lag a little bit and we'll just see. Well, in Asia -- Asia is a big, it varies. Some countries have much better control of virus than others. And then, the excess -- some of the new refining capacity in China becomes relevant there. So, the U.S. is strengthened for sure, as I said earlier that with Winter Storm Uri, and you're seeing that in petrochemical too. So I do think second quarter, third quarter are going to look better. It is a global market. So these markets do stay connected Asia has also recovered somewhat and we'll see where the results are over the next few quarters.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: So I just have one question. And I want to revisit this reinvestment topic because it seems pretty influential right now. So as you know, you field a lot of questions about your organic maintenance capital. And then anything inorganic is supposed to be accretive to some metric, whatever people choose. But I think is it fair to say that with Noble what we're seeing is, a flexible strategy to reserve and production management. If you're generating surplus cash, you're building capacity for inorganic ads, to manage sustainability and we should think about it as kind of a multi-faceted approach instead of this siloed point of view that that people seem to be shoehorning you into. Is that fair?\nPierre Breber: I think so, Sam. Yes. I mean, when we look at just the organic capital, and you say, again, we were 13 billion and some change, last year, 14 billion, and we had planned to be at 20 billion each year pre-COVID. And that you look, you make that comparison, but to not include the inorganic seems to not tell the whole story and I think you saw that in a lot of reserve replacements of other numbers. And you saw that in our Investor Day, our ability to basically get pretty close to the same production guidance, five years out this year versus where we were last year, is a reflection of greater capital efficiency, but also the Noble transaction now, so that I agree with you. Whether we do that again or not that's a separate question. We again, we don't have to do that we can sustain and grow the enterprise are sustaining CapEx on the upstream side, excluding exploration, how we've defined it is about 9 billion. So we are above that.. Of course, we're investing in Tengiz, which we know is going to result in higher production and much stronger, higher cash flow. So again, we showed a free cash flow growing 10% per year. So I do understand all the questions, I think you are hitting it, it is a little bit focusing on half of the story, you got to look at the whole story. Of course, we're managing the whole company, and again, keeping an eye on long-term value.\nOperator: We will take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: Two things one, you haven't talked and I don't perceive this to be an issue, but because based on your costs, I'm just wondering, are you certainly concerned just if you would talk a little bit about OFS potential inflation, both domestic and international? And then, same sort of thing around any raw material shortages and maybe include personnel there?\nPierre Breber: Yes, short answer is nothing at this point in time, lots of talk about it. But we are not seeing, request for price increases for that. In terms of inputs, certainly steel prices are up. So that would flow through to our wells and the oil tubulars. And we are seeing this impacts more the downstream, trucker shortages. And so that, in terms of personnel, we're seeing that I think that's in part, the Amazon effect and all the delivery UPS and the rest, pulling a lot of truckers off. So we think that will work itself out. So those are pretty minor and targeted in terms of general oil field services, inflation, not seeing it here in the U.S. or internationally. But, we're cognizant oil prices are higher, and we're certainly hearing the top just not seeing it on the ground.\nNeal Dingmann: Okay. And then, just lastly on and you talked about the new carbonization projects in California. I just wondered, as you transact and sort of jump into more of those? Is that going to be more sort of return based or what is sort of driving, as you see opportunities in that, I just want -- maybe from a broader standpoint, if I could ask.\nPierre Breber: Yes. We're very clear that our message and our goal is higher returns lower carbon. And that's true in our conventional business. And that's true in M&A and how we walked away from Anadarko and how we did the Noble transaction. And that's true in energy transition. When you look at hydrogen and carbon capture, you're reviewing those as growth businesses that can do both higher returns and lower carbon. There are other parts of our energy transition strategy, lowering the carbon from our operations, which I mentioned earlier, increasing renewable products, all of those also need to generate return. So we're very clear what we do in the space has to be good for the environment and good for shareholders. And so far, we're able to accomplish both and we think activity will increase going forward.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Green for any additional or closing remarks.\nRoderick Green: Thanks, Katie. We would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call today. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.\nOperator: This concludes Chevron's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please, go ahead.\nRoderick Green: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Roderick Green, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. Also listening in today is Jake Spiering, the incoming General Manager of Investor Relations, who will assume this position effective March 1. Jake and I will be transitioning together over the next couple of months. It's been my sincere pleasure working with each of you over the last two years. Thank you for your questions, feedback and investment in Chevron. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide two. Now, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMike Wirth: Thank you, Roderick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Chevron had an outstanding year in 2022, delivering record financial performance, producing more traditional energy and advancing lower carbon businesses. Free cash flow set a record, beating our previous high in 2021 by more than $15 billion, enabling a strong dividend increase and the buyback of almost 4% of our shares. US production was also our highest ever, led by double-digit growth in the Permian. Growth matters when it's profitable. Return on capital employed over 20% shows that our focus on capital efficiency is delivering results. And we took important steps in building new energy businesses. We successfully integrated REG's people and assets into Chevron, combining the best of both companies' technical and commercial capabilities. And we acquired rights to pore space for potential carbon capture and storage projects in Texas and Australia. We had many other highlights last year, to name just a few, at TCO, project construction is largely complete, and we're starting up the fuel gas system. Focus is on commissioning and start-up of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project by the end of this year, to begin transition of the field from high to low pressure. We announced a significant new gas discovery offshore Egypt, which could build on our growing natural gas position in the Eastern Med. And our affiliate CPChem reached FID for two world-scale ethylene and derivative projects in Texas and Qatar. 2022 was a dynamic year, with unique macroeconomic and geopolitical forces disrupting economies and industries around the globe. These events remind us of the importance of affordable and reliable energy with a lower carbon intensity over time. We don't know what's ahead in 2023. I do know that Chevron's approach will be clear and consistent, focused on capital, cost and operational discipline, with the objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss our financials.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Mike. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $6.4 billion or $3.33 per share. Adjusted earnings were $7.9 billion or $4.09 per share. Included in the quarter were $1.1 billion in write-offs and impairments in our international upstream segment, and negative foreign currency effects over $400 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Record operating cash flows in combination with continued capital efficiency, resulted in over $37 billion of free cash flow in 2022. The only other year Chevron's operating cash flow exceeded $40 billion was 2011. Free cash flow in that year was less than 40% and of this year's record. In 2022, Chevron delivered outstanding results on all four of its financial priorities. Announcing earlier this week another 6% increase in our dividend per share, positioning 2023 to be the 36th consecutive year with annual dividend payout increases, investing within its organic budget despite cost inflation. Inorganic CapEx totaled $1.3 billion nearly 80% for new energy investments. Paying down debt in every quarter and ending the year with a 3% net debt ratio, returning record annual cash to shareholders through buybacks and exiting the year with an annual repurchase rate of $15 billion. Two days ago, Chevron's Board of Directors authorized a new $75 billion share repurchase program. Now is a good time to look back on our execution of the prior programs. Over the past nearly two decades, we bought back shares in more than three out of every four years, returning more than $65 billion to shareholders. And we've done it below the market average price during the whole time period. Going forward with the new program, our intent is the same, be a steady buyer of our shares across commodity cycles. With a breakeven Brent price around $50 per barrel to cover our CapEx and dividend and with excess balance sheet capacity, we're positioned to return more cash to shareholders in any reasonable oil price scenario. Turning to the quarter. Adjusted earnings were down nearly $3 billion compared with last quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower realizations and liftings as well as higher exploration expense, partially offset by favorable timing effects. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily on lower refining and chemicals margins and negative timing effects partially offset with higher sales volumes following third quarter turnarounds. The Other segment charges increased mainly due to accruals for stock-based compensation. For the full year, adjusted earnings increased more than $20 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted upstream earnings were up primarily due to increased realizations. Other items include higher exploration expenses, higher incremental royalties and production taxes due to higher prices, partially offset by favorable tax benefits and other items. Downstream adjusted earnings increased primarily due to higher refining margins, partially offset by lower chemical earnings and higher maintenance and turnaround costs. 2022 production was in line with guidance after adjusting for higher prices. As a reminder, Chevron's share of production is lower under certain international contracts when actual prices are higher than assumed in our guidance. Reserves replacement ratio was nearly 100% with the largest net additions in the Permian, Israel, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. Higher prices lowered our share of proved reserves by over 100 million barrels of oil equivalent. 2023 production is expected to be flat to up 3% at $80 Brent. After adjusting for lower prices and portfolio changes, primarily the sale of our Eagle Ford asset and the expiration of a contract in Thailand, we expect production to grow led by the Permian and other shale and tight assets. We remain confident in exceeding our long-term production guidance. Looking ahead to 2023, I'll call out a few items. Earnings estimates from first quarter refinery turnarounds are mostly driven by El Segundo. Based on the current outlook, we expect higher natural gas costs for our California refineries. Full year guidance for all other segment losses is lower this year due to higher expected interest income and again excludes special items such as pension settlement costs. The All Other segment can vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We estimate annual affiliate dividends between $5 billion and $6 billion, depending primarily on commodity prices and margins. The difference between affiliate earnings and dividends is expected to be less than $2 billion. We do not expect a dividend from TCO in the first quarter. We updated our earnings sensitivities. About 20% of the Brent sensitivity relates to oil-linked LNG sales. Also, we expect to maintain share buybacks at the top end of our guidance range during the first quarter. Finally, as a reminder in Venezuela, we use cost affiliate accounting, which means we will only record earnings, if we receive cash. We do not record production or reserves. 2022 was a record year for Chevron in many ways. We look forward to the future, confident in our strategy with a consistent objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. We'll share more during our Investor Day next month. Back to you, Roderick.\nRoderick Green: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions.\nMike Wirth: Good morning, Jeanine.\nJeanine Wai: Before we get started \u2013 hi, good morning, Mike. We'd like to wish Roderick well in his new position, and we really appreciate all your time and help over the past two years. So thank you very much. Our first question, maybe just heading towards the buyback authorization topic. This week, the Board authorized the buyback authorization up to $75 billion, no expiration date, which is pretty large versus the prior authorization that had a four-year expiration date. We heard your comments on wanting to be a steady buyer of your shares across cycles and that you're positioned to return more cash to shareholders. Can you comment on the decision-making process for getting to that $75 billion and maybe the choice to leave the authorization open in timing versus the prior authorization did have an expiration date?\nMike Wirth: Yeah, Jeanine, let me start, and then I'll have Pierre add a little bit of color. We included a little information on this call looking back at our past programs. And as you saw on the slide 15 of the last 19 years, we've bought shares back lower than the market volume weighted average over that period of time. We look at the decision going forward in the context of the cash-generating potential of the portfolio, the outlook for the market environment, the strength of the balance sheet. And we don't want to be authorizing a program every year. So, we talk to the Board about a multiyear outlook. So, the fact that there's not an end date on it is only significant if you're trying to do some sort of math and annualize this. We think our track record speaks for ourselves and the steady, consistent way that we've done this. And so, we increased the rate three times last year as we saw the situation evolve, and we're now at an all-time high with the rate of repurchases. So, the last thing you said it, but I'll repeat it, is sized to maintain our program through the commodity cycle. We aren't pro-cyclical. We're not countercyclical. We're steady through the cycle, and that is the intention. Pierre, do you want to add anything?\nPierre Breber: Yes, Jeanine. So, the authorization from 2019 was going to be consumed in the second quarter. It was also open. So, it did not have a defined time period. We just -- will have consumed it. So, instead of having an authorization in the middle of the quarter, we'll complete this quarter's buybacks under the 2019 authorization, which again had an open time period, and then we'll start the new on April 1st. So, it is similar the way it was done in the prior time.\nJeanine Wai: Thank you for that clarification. We appreciate that. Maybe our second question, it's that time of year again, reserve replacement ratio, your ratio for 2022 was 97%. And we believe that compared to 112% last year, and then I think it was around 99% on average for the five years before that. So, our question for you is just -- how do you see this ratio trending over time? And I guess the over or under bogey is probably 100%. Thank you.\nMike Wirth: Yes. So, it can move in any given year, Jeanine for a whole host of reasons, right? Prices, FID decisions, portfolio actions that we take to either sell or buy. And so, the one-year number is one that will move around. The longer cycle numbers, the one that you ought to pay attention to. Remember also, as we have this large position in the Permian we continue to develop. We can only book five years forward. And so, each year, we'll produce out of the unconventional assets, and we'll add another year's worth of reserves on the back end of that. And so, if you were to look at the Permian unconstrained by that, you'd have a very different view. This year, we had some additions in the Permian and Israel and Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, as Pierre mentioned, the largest net reduction this year were Kazakhstan due to the contract terms and the effect of higher prices. If you were to actually adjust that out, so we mentioned 100 million barrels where the price effect this year would be -- think of it as 107% ex the price effect. And so, I do think over time, we intend to be in this business for quite a while and 100% is a number that you ought to expect to see that or greater over time. But in any given year or any short number of years, you might see something looks a little bit different.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, Roderick, I wanted to echo Jeanine\u2019s congrats on the new role and thank you for all the help over the years and great working with you. So I wanted to focus in on upstream. And it's good to see the continued progress on TCO and exciting to be getting close to the finish line on the expansion project there. You noted that WPMP is on track for commissioning and start-up later this year. I just wanted to first confirm that the second part of that expansion, FGP is still on track for '24. And then just stepping back, could you just walk us through your latest expectations to the impacts on both TCO production, CapEx and then also affiliate dividends as these projects come online. Trying to get a sense of the changes in '24 versus '23? And then also, how you think about the run rate on both volumes and spending for that affiliate post FGP.\nMike Wirth: Yes. Devin, I'll talk to the project and let Pierre talk a little bit to the financials. First of all, no change to cost or schedule guidance. WPMP is trending toward a beginning start-up by the end of this year. We've got a lot of work done. We've got a new power grid up and running and this was a power grid built back in the Soviet days. The control room is up and running, where everything comes into one central control room. All the production on gas injection wells are done, the gas injection facility is now in early commissioning. In just the next few days, we'll tie in the fuel gas system to the first gas turbine generator, which is really an important milestone to test the first of the three GTGs, begin the process of powering up electrical generation capacity and commissioning boilers, steam and other utilities. So, that all happens sequentially here over the next period of time, which leads to commissioning the pressure boost compressors in the third quarter and then converting the field from beginning the conversion from high to low pressure by the end of the year. A couple of things that will bear on production. We've got two planned turnarounds of the old processing trains. They're called the KTL. There's five of them. We had two turnarounds this year that are planned in the third quarter. So those will be down for a period of time. And then as those come back up, production may not fully recover on those two as some of the wells won't resume flowing until we get to the low-pressure system. So, back half of the year, you'll see a little bit of that impact. And then as we move into '24, we've got more of these high pressure to low-pressure conversions in the field and we've got FGP start-up first half of '24. So you don't see the full effect of FGP roll through, you get partial effect in ramping in '24, and then the full effect will show in '25. Cash will kind of follow that pattern. So Pierre, maybe you can talk about the pattern on CapEx and dividends.\nPierre Breber: Yes. For 2023, the TCO dividends are included in the guidance we provided, $5 billion, $6 billion, which is up from what our total dividends that we received last year. We did indicate that TCO has held a little excess cash during the course of last year just due to uncertainties that are going on right now. The CapEx was included in our December release. So it's nearly half of the $3 billion of -- affiliate CapEx, so that\u2019s $1.5 billion. Again, you would expect that to continue to roll off next year. And then if you go back to our Investor Day, we showed that at $60 Brent post start-up in a full year of FGP production, that the free cash flow coming out of TCO on 100% basis would be $10 billion. And again, that's a $60 Brent. We'll provide further updates as we normally do on Investor Day. But the takeaway, as we've said for a long time, now we've been investing in this project for six plus years through COVID, through the ups and downs, when it starts up, it will generate a lot of free cash flow. We'll see that in the form of dividends, and we'll see that in the form of paying back some of the loans that we co-lend into TCO.\nMike Wirth: Devin, just to kind of put a final punctuation on that. In our Investor Day last year, we showed in 2026, so once we get fully on the other side of all this stuff I just described, a 5x expansion in free cash flow out of TCO versus 2021. So it's meaningful.\nDevin McDermott: Okay. Great. Thank you very much for the helpful answer there. And thinking about this year, 2023 in more detail. You talked about 0% to 3% total production growth for the year, led by sale in the Permian. And last year, you had another strong one for the Permian unit volumes were up 16%. I was wondering if you could just talk through your expectations for that asset in 2023, whether or not you're adding rigs there, overall activity trends? And then more broadly within that 2% to 3% range, what are some of the drivers that can move to the upper or lower end as we move through the year.\nMike Wirth: Yes. Maybe I'll finish on -- I think the second question is about overall production, and the first was about Permian. So our outlook for 2023 at $80 is flat to up 3%, so that post between 3 million and 3.1 million barrels a day. There's a modest adjustment that relative to our Investor Day guidance. A couple of things driving that, some project deferrals like Mad Dog 2, which we thought would start up in 2022 and now looks like a 2023 startup. We've got some downtime, plans downtime that shifted from 2022 to 2023. And then our Permian growth would be a little bit lower in 2023. A couple of things. One, in 2022, we had the benefit of a lot of prior DUCs that had been sitting that came online and it boost early production in 2022, a little bit more. And then we also are re-optimizing some of our development plans to factor in some of the things we continue to learn relative to interactions between wells and benches, how we space laterals and do single or multi-bench development. So our revised plan will have some deeper targets, a few more rig moves and a few more single bench developments, all of which brings that pace down a little bit. So that's kind of at the highest level, what is behind the production numbers. We'll talk about that more when we see you guys in a month here. And maybe I'll stop there, because I did cover the Permian as part of that. Thanks, Devin. Katie, we can go the next question. Katie, can you hear us?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Good morning team and congrats here on a good year. Hey, Mike, I guess the first question I have for you is around global gas. And maybe you can talk about how you're seeing the market. There's obviously been a tremendous amount of volatility and remind us again how you're positioned from a contracted versus spot position? And then I have a follow-up on gas as well in the Eastern Med.\nMike Wirth: Okay. Well, high level, we certainly have seen a very unusual and volatile year in 2022, which has settled out here as we've come into the winter, primarily as we've seen a bit milder winter in the northern hemisphere than is typical. And as in Europe, the successful build of inventories for this year and the reduction of industrial demand have both resulted in an outlook that is less dire for the European economies, than it may have looked like several months ago. And so I think the market reflects all of that. You also have the fact that China has been -- the economy has been slow throughout the year, which is -- looks to be turning around. And so I think it's good that markets have calmed. I mean the high prices really were creating a lot of stresses out there that are not good. And I hope we see these prices stay in a more moderate range as we enter 2023. Our posture is largely as we've described it before, we're primarily contracted on oil index pricing, biggest piece, obviously, out of Australia. We do have -- we ran really well in Australia last year, a record number of cargoes and so there were some spot cargoes in the mix out of Australia, out of West Africa, we've got a little more spot exposure in Angola and now with Equatorial Guinea as well. But think of us as primarily oil-linked. And we've got some sensitivities, I think that Pierre has put out there, and we've reiterated some of those in the guidance today that should help you model these things based on your assumptions on gas prices.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Mike. And that's the follow-up. You have a large gas position in the Eastern Mediterranean, following the noble acquisition with Leviathan and Tamar and some discoveries out there as well. So how do you think about prosecuting that asset? Where does it fall in terms of prioritization? And how big can it be?\nMike Wirth: Yes. It's a high priority. We took FID at the end of last year on a project to expand Tamar from -- on a 100% basis, 1.1 to 1.6 Bcf per day. The first gas on that should come online in early 2025. We are working on development options to expand Leviathan. Those are still being worked and we should narrow the concepts on that later this year and reach some decisions in terms of how we intend to do that. The Nargis discovery, it's just one well at this point, but it encountered a significant section of high-quality gas-bearing sandstone. So very attractive. We're talking to our partner there about appraisal and development concepts that will follow. So that region -- and of course, we've got a number of additional exploration blocks further to the west in the Mediterranean that we've not yet put any wells into but we've got seismic and we're developing our exploration plans and you'll hear more about that as we go forward. So it's a high priority. The region needs gas, both regionally in the Middle East, but also then obviously options to try to get that gas into Europe. And so the noble acquisition was really advantageous from that standpoint, and we're optimistic about the prospectivity of some of these additional exploration blocks.\nNeil Mehta: Very well. Stay tuned. Thanks, Mike.\nMike Wirth: Okay. Thank you, Neil.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Well, thanks, everyone. Roderick, I'd like to also pass on my thanks. You've transformed Chevron does Investor Relations. Thank you for all your help. Guys, I wonder if I could go back to the buyback. I just want to try and understand a little bit about the comment around really just how you think about the purpose of the buyback. Is this really about dividend management at this point? Because it seems to us that, if you take your Brent sensitivity into account, the run rate at the high end of the range puts you about a $90 breakeven on your oil price. And I'm just wondering if this is about value or about managing confidence in future dividend growth.\nMike Wirth: Well, let me try to be clear on this, Doug. We do not do buybacks to manage dividends. Dividend -- absolute dividend load is an outcome. It's not a reason that you would do buybacks. Our dividend growth expresses confidence in the ability to grow free cash flow at mid-cycle prices, and it is a long-term decision, a long, long, long-term decision. We haven't cut the dividend since the great depression. Pierre mentioned, we've increased the payout 36 years in a row now. Buybacks are different. They signal confidence that we're going to generate excess free cash flow, where we've got excess balance sheet capacity, which we have significant capacity in the current commodity cycle. And as we satisfy our commitments on the dividend, our reinvestment plans in a disciplined manner to grow free cash flows and maintain that strong balance sheet, we've got the capacity then to buy shares back through the cycle. An outcome of buybacks is a lower absolute dividend, but it's not the driver. And so, I don't want -- there should be no confusion about that. We've got confidence in our dividend increases, whether we're buying shares back or not. We wouldn't increase the dividend if we didn't have that confidence. And so the two are not linked in that manner.\nDoug Leggate: That's very clear. Thanks, Mike. My follow-up is a bit unfair, given your Analyst Day is a month away, but I'm going to give this a go anyway. But -- so if you made the point in -- your balance sheet is in terrific shape, obviously. You've got a lot of capacity there. But also, if I go back to that sort of $90 breakeven, all I'm doing is taking that $15 billion run rate, $400 million a year and adding it to the $50 breakeven, $90. What does that say about your outlook for maybe stepping up growth capital? That would seem to imply that the growth capital of the $17 billion for the CapEx number is probably what we should expect going forward. Is that the right way to think about it, or should we wait until the end of the month, at the end of February?\nMike Wirth: Yes. I mean, we'll talk about it more in February. I'm not sure I followed all your math there, but we're growing. We had a 3% compound annual growth rate at $15 billion to $17 billion of CapEx in a market that's not growing that fast. We're growing well better than the overall demand for oil or for gas, which is growing faster than oil is. And so, we are growing production, but what we're really focused on is growing returns and cash flow. And if we can grow returns and cash flow, the equation works. And so, I -- we'll be happy to talk about this more when we're together at the end of the month, but -- or at the end of next month. But we can grow cash flow; we can improve returns at the rate that we're spending at. And so, I don't know why there would be a question about our ability to do that and the production numbers and outcome of those decisions. It's not the goal.\nDoug Leggate: Appreciate the answers. Really glad. See you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan. \nJohn Royall: Hi, guys.\nMike Wirth: Good morning, John.\nJohn Royall: Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. So maybe just kind of a spin on Doug's question. So with the balance sheet at 3%, is there a point where you think of yourself is actually underlevered and I realize that's a good problem to have. But if you ever got to that point with the mechanism be to get leverage higher by increasing the buyback, or how do you think about that generally is the 3% where you want to be?\nPierre Breber: This is Pierre. I'll take that. Our guidance is for the net debt ratio to be between 20% and 25% and mid-cycle conditions. And as you said, we're at 3%, so we're much stronger than that. And that's what happens in the short-term. So Mike has talked about our financial priorities. They're simple. We've been consistent with them for a very long time. And three of the four are pegged. We just increased our dividend 6%. We have a 2023 CapEx budget of $14 billion. We've given guidance that keeps that CapEx flat over the next several years. And we have the buybacks at the top end of the guidance range of $15 billion. So swings in cash flow in the short-term will go to the balance sheet. And that's because commodity prices and margins, we just were talking about natural gas prices and refining margins and things are moving up and down. But over the long-term, those cash flows will be returned to shareholders. And so we want to do it in a way that is steady across the cycle. As Mike said, we don't want to be pro-cyclical. And by the way, we haven't, right? Our track record shows that over the past nearly two decades that we've been able to buy actually below what the market average price has been. So the intent is to, yeah, we'll be a little strong balance sheet depending on commodity prices and margins and how strong our operations have been. But then over time, the cycle will correct and then we'll continue buying back shares. We've said we could have a higher buyback rate right now. We're sizing it at a level to maintain it for multiple years across the cycle. That means there'll be a time period where we'll be buying back shares off the balance sheet, and we'll lever back up closer to that 20% to 25% guidance. Thanks, John.\nJohn Royall: Very clear. Thank you, Pierre. And just a follow-up on the TCO project. I was hoping you could give an update on the CPC terminal operationally and where that stands. And then what type of discounts are you seeing at that terminal right now? I think you called out a few quarters ago or maybe two quarters ago that it was $6 or $7 per barrel. I imagine that's come in a bit. So where is that discount today? And how is that terminal operating?\nMike Wirth: Yeah. So last year, there was probably more news than there was impact on a variety of issues relative to the pipeline and the terminal. There was work going on in the late third and into the fourth quarter on the two of the three single point mornings. All that work is done. All three SPMs are operational today. There are no constraints on loading. There are no constraints on throughput on the pipe. Despite a lot of the things that people heard and worried about last year, the pipeline was very reliable. Our production was impacted less than 10,000 barrels a day over the course of the year. It was all a few weeks in March and April. And so everything there is running very smoothly now, and we don't see any constraints. Discounts have come in a little bit on CPC. In the immediate aftermath of some of the sanctions and changes related to Ukraine. We saw a trading range that was like $4 to $10 below dated Brent. And before the conflict began, it was plus or minus $1. We're seeing kind of $1 to $3 discounts now. So maybe not quite at pre-invasion levels, but not as deep as they were immediately afterwards. And given the overall flat price environment and the way it has strengthened the impact to CCO is relatively muted.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.\nMike Wirth: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: Hey, good morning, guys. Just looking at, let's call it, refined product demand. You talked about gas demand earlier. I'm just curious, as you look around the world, we've got positives moving away from COVID on a year-over-year comparison and then everybody's got high expectations for the China reopening. I was just curious, as you look across your operating base, what you're seeing there?\nMike Wirth: Yeah. Overall, Roger, gasoline demand, I'll start there. Still just a touch below pre-pandemic levels, fourth quarter of 2022 maybe 2% or 3% below fourth quarter of 2019. If you look at diesel, demand is pretty flat versus pre-pandemic. Jet recovering, but still below and so at the highest level, we're kind of still flattish to recovering from pre-COVID. I think that's why there is concern that as China's economy really does come through and return to a more normal level, that we could see increased demand start to pull on these markets again. You've seen announcements out of China about their intention. We see international flights and air travel now being scheduled at much higher levels than we've seen before long. And if you see the kind of rebound spending and activity in that economy that we've seen in other economies around the world, that's one of the things that could buoy the global economy and firm up demand for products. So, there's still some variables in the equation. We're not past the risk of recession and clearly, central banks are still tightening to slow things in certain parts of the world. So there's some puts and takes. But net-net, this continues to trend in a recovering direction with the two biggest questions probably related to the two biggest economies, China and the US.\nRoger Read: Always the big guys, right? A follow-up question to come back to the Permian, and I recognize the Investor Day coming. But Pierre, when we were at the sell-side dinner end of November, there was a lot of discussion over kind of the changing in the range and how that was really just a function of messaging more so than \u2013 overall change in the way you're developing the Permian, kind of following from that to the comments about things a little different in the bench and the DUC comparisons year-over-year. You look at it as any different from the messaging at the end of November, or is this \u2013 is there something else here with.\nPierre Breber: No, nothing different. We'll show that at our Investor Day. Again, we were in the middle of the range. You can see the fourth quarter number was 738. So that was strong. We had some learning's, as Mike said, in 2022, and we've adjusted our plans to go to deeper targets and more single bench developments and that results in a little longer drilling times and a few more rig moves and we'll update all that. And all that is obviously included in our production guidance. So we'll continue to learn and adapt in the Permian. It's a large royalty advantage position. It's an asset that delivers higher returns and lower carbon. It's a big source of free cash flow. Our free cash flow growth over the next five years is really driven by Permian, [indiscernible], Gulf of Mexico, a few other assets. And it's remarkable to have an asset that can grow at that rate and do it free cash flow positive the whole time and free cash flow growing the whole time. So, it will ebb and flow a little bit as we learn more, but what you'll see at our Investor Day, something very consistent with what we're saying today and what we said in the past.\nMike Wirth: And Roger, just to emphasize the point I made earlier to another one of the questions, we remain focused on returns and value, not on production. And so that is the -- that's what drives all of this. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Societe General.\nIrene Himona: Thank you very much for taking my questions which are both related. So, I will ask both at the same time. So, firstly, thinking about balance sheet strength, of course, the other use it can be put to is M&A. You've been very disciplined with your M&A timings, both with Noble and Regi [ph]. How do you see the current market in these two, let's say, POTS [ph] legacy oil and gas versus low carbon? And then secondly, has the IRA Act perhaps changed your appetite for faster expansion in low carbon businesses, please? Thank you.\nMike Wirth: Thank you, Irene. So, we do have the capacity to do M&A. We don't need to do M&A. And so, we'll only do deals that are value-creating deals. You interestingly contrast the traditional oil and gas market with the new energies market. What I would observe is given commodity price strength in oil and gas, we've seen companies that previously might have been languishing from a value standpoint, strengthen. And I think there's some optimism in the eyes of other companies about the future. And so, the bid/ask spread on oil and gas companies is maybe a little wider right now given the strength versus when we did our deal a couple of years ago. In lower carbon, with interest rates rising and spacs kind of receiving and the like. A little bit of the kind of froth may have come out of that market, but they're still some optimism in valuations there as well. And so, we'll be very thoughtful and careful as we evaluate those. And there are a lot of companies out there that have got business models in this space. So, we watch them all. We will be back to talk to you if we have anything that's interesting. Let me touch on IRA and then ask Pierre to add a little more color. The IRA will probably accelerate some activity in the US. There's no doubt. Hopefully, what that does is it allows technologies to be de-risked. The cost of technologies to be reduced and the attractiveness of these investments to improve. A bill like that with kind of a grab bag of different policy incentives doesn't necessarily change our long-term view on how we want to build businesses. It does perhaps change the trajectory at which some of those businesses become more economically viable. And if that's the case, that could feed through into our similar investment decision. But it's kind of a second order effect rather than a first order effect.\nPierre Breber: And just to add some of the other important effects, permitting really critical for traditional energy, super critical for new energy, new technology developments, you've seen us make some investments on technology to reduce the cost of capture of CO2 and then scale, getting cost down. So it's helpful, but it's just one element, as Mike said.\nMike Wirth: Thanks, Irene\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. Maybe if I could ask a couple on the downstream side. First, there's been a lot of noise earlier this year about refinery maintenance activity looking to be well above average in the US, particularly in the first half of the year, especially amongst independent refiners. Your first quarter guidance seems to suggest turnaround activity in 1Q that's reasonably light or at least not terribly heavy. Any thoughts on whether 2020 -- year 2023 outlook as a whole for Chevron looks normal or heavy in terms of refining and maintenance. And then maybe more broadly, how you see general tightness in global refining markets this year over the course of 2023?\nMike Wirth: Yes. I would say it's a pretty typical year for turnaround activity. We've got the FCC at El Segundo in the first quarter of this year, which Pierre mentioned in his comments. But there's nothing unusual in our turnaround plan for this year. What you do see across the US and I think in some of the other markets are two things that are really kind of still echoes of COVID. One is you're just seeing capacity go out of the system. And two, you see maintenance that was deferred during COVID is -- had to be rescheduled and replanned. And so there's probably still a bit of a bow wave of pushing through the system in some places of activity that needs to get done for safety and reliability and regulatory reasons. And so that could be driving some of the speculation. I can't really comment on other companies' plans. I'll let you talk to them about that.\nRyan Todd: Okay. And then maybe on the other side of your downstream business on the chemical side, it's clearly been weeks for the last little while. Looking forward from here, is the combination of lower natural gas prices and the reopening of China having any impact on how you see margins moving throughout 2023, or do you anticipate that oversupply keep things weaker throughout the year?\nMike Wirth: These tend to be long period cycles for the most part, Ryan. And so, at the margin, I think that's economic growth and development in China is a positive. But you don't slide into the lower part of the cycle quickly or easily, and you generally don't come out of it quickly or easily. So these things track over a longer period of time. And so, I do think we're -- it feels like we're kind of bumping along near the bottom here, but I don't know that there's a steep climb out as opposed to a gradual climb over time.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to first follow up on the affiliate distribution guidance because it is taking a step higher year-over-year, and it sounds like that was due to TCO having excess cash. Is that kind of $5 billion to $6 billion, something you can maintain assuming oil price stays stable until the project actually starts up until TCO FGP starts up or would you expect that to fall off after this year? And then my second question is on a different topic, Venezuela. I believe you have now boots on the ground there again. Can you just discuss what you're seeing in terms of the health of the infrastructure there, the ability to ramp production and the desire from Chevron's standpoint to participate in that? Thanks.\nPierre Breber : On affiliate dividends, there are two main factors why the guidance this year is higher than last year. You hit one of them on TCO, not held excess cash last year. The second big one is Angola LNG. You recall, a lot of their cash distributions were actually return to capital. It's an accounting concept tied to whether you have book equity or positive book equity or not now, they're in that space. So we expect most, if not all, of the cash coming from Angola LNG in 2023 to be characterized as dividends. It was cash either way. It's just one shows up in cash from ops, the other one shows up in a different part of the cash flow statement, but that's the second driver. And in terms of the direction, I mean, this guidance is kind of notionally at the current -- futures curve around $80. So it depends on commodity prices and margins. There are some downstream affiliates in there, the chemicals, obviously, in there. But we talked about TCO. I mean, TCO's heading up, right. As CapEx comes down and production comes up, we expect more dividends out of TCO going forward. And then again, we have the loan that we also expect TCO to pay back during the next several years.\nMike Wirth: Yes, Jason, on Venezuela, we always did have boots on the ground. We just were very limited in where those boots could go and what they could do. The shift in the sanctions policy has opened up a little more room. It's allowed us to work with PDVSA to put some of our people into different roles in these mixed companies there. So we do have a little more ability to have influence and involvement in some of the decision making. Your question about the state of the infrastructure, there's been a lack of investments there for a number of years in the infrastructure reflects that, and it will take time for things to turn around. We have seen some positive production response already in the entities that we're involved in. They're producing about 90,000 barrels a day now, which is up about 40,000 barrels a day since we saw the change in these license terms. So that's been a good short-term effect. I'm not going to say you can extrapolate that, but it's where we are today. We are continuing to work on the ground to expand production, but it's too early to guide to anything. We're also lifting oil and bringing it to the US. We've got a couple of cargoes coming into our Pascagoula Refinery. We're going to be delivering cargoes to other customers on the Gulf Coast. And then the revenues go into a series of structured channels to pay expenses and other obligations. On the accounting standpoint, we're using cost affiliate accounting. So we'll record earnings only if we receive cash. And at this point, I would say the cash flows are expected to be modest. So this is a step-wise change in the environment there. We're going to go into it thoughtfully. It's a six-month license, and it's a dynamic environment. So we'll continue to advise you as we learn more and as things evolve.\nJason Gabelman: Great. Thanks a lot for the detail.\nMike Wirth: You bet.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research\nSam Margolin: Hey, good morning. Thank you.\nMike Wirth: Good morning, Sam.\nSam Margolin: I'll ask about the Rockies. The Rockies is interesting. It's a place where you could maybe add a little bit of activity to face your aggregate Lower 48 activity levels, but without some of the inflationary pressures and just infrastructure tightness in the Permian and inventory depth there is good. Is the Rockies a place where there may be a little bit of extra focus. And I ask that in the context of sort of the broader theme around your overall resource depth and production and all these topics that are sort of flowing into the broader conversation today.\nMike Wirth: Yes, absolutely, Sam. We got over 320,000 net acres there. Last year, we started out with one rig and one frac crew. We ended the year with three rigs and two frac crews working and the plan for this year is activity in that level. So it's been a positive movement in terms of activity and production expectations there. It's a really nice resource. It's a low carbon resource. It's a -- we got a lot of this is powered off the grid. There's been some permitting questions about this in the past. There's been large areas done under development plans, and we've got permits well out into the future and continue to work that closely with the authorities there. So -- it's one we can talk about a little bit more at Investor Day. It's a really positive part of addition to our portfolio out of Noble and the Eastern Med gets a lot of attention, but we're very excited about the DJ.\nSam Margolin: Okay. And yes, just a follow-up. I mean, because obviously, between -- I think you can surmise the reserve numbers getting some attention to the overall pace of activity and production trends over the long-term are getting attention. But we'll get to this at the Analyst Day, I'm sure. But is there a way right now where you can kind of add it all up and size the Gulf of Mexico, other shale and tight, Eastern Med gas and just kind of frame that aggregate resource number against maybe what you see in the portfolio today as tail resource and just speak to a final answer around your organic portfolio and how it extends.\nMike Wirt: Yes. I might have Roderick work with you. So we're clear on the question when we get to the Investor Day on how to compare and size things relative to the portfolio. But we said today in our press release that we're very confident we're going to exceed our 3% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. You can't do that unless you get depth in the portfolio, which we have. And you got quality projects they're moving along on a good pace. And so I'll assure you that, that is the case. We will talk about this more at Investor Day, and you'll have a chance to kind of go deeper into it with our folks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research.\nPaul Sankey: Hi. Good morning, everyone and Roderick, congratulations, all the best. Mike, I was a bit surprised by the major buyback announcement. Obviously, the $75 billion is very splashy. But within that, it seems that your guidance has remained that you'll be in the $5 billion to $15 billion a year range based on the Q1 guidance. Is there -- are you expecting to step that up, or is this a five-year authorization? And were you conscious that it would probably cause a lot of political backlash? Thanks.\nMike Wirth: Yes. So, Pierre answered the question earlier, it's not a five-year authorization. It's an open-ended authorization. It is -- it's our intent to maintain it across the cycle. I'll just say that again. It's actually aligned with our upside in our downside cases from the 2022 Investor Day and consistent with our track record of being in the market steadily buying $2 below the market over nearly the past two decades. And we could increase our guidance range, Paul. We need to be confident we could maintain that higher rate for multiple years across the cycle. And I think that you should read it as a signal of confidence and we'll continue to talk more. We raised our buyback rate three times last year. So we're not averse to doing that. And I would just say stay tuned. In terms of the reaction to it, I think it's perhaps been a touch overblown given that it's an open-ended program, and we could have sized a smaller one and just been prepared to do another one sooner. Pierre said, we're closing one out. We just looked at something that would last over a number of years, and we were trying to be splashy when we're trying to create any reaction out there. We're just trying to indicate the confidence we have in our cash generation.\nPaul Sankey: Understood. And offset to that, Mike, you're spending more on exploration. Could you just talk about the highlights that you see coming up in 2023. Obviously, we're aware of East Med, but there's other stuff out there and the spending has stepped up quite a lot, hasn't it?\nMike Wirth: Yes. I don't know if I describe the spending as being up quite a lot. We've got a nice portfolio that we like. And I'll just touch on -- you mentioned Eastern Med. We still have a lot of blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We've got block in Suriname that we're still working on and that are on trend with some of the things in that region. We've picked up acreage in Namibia that's on trend with explorations in that part of the world as well. And so we got stuff in Brazil, we had stuff in Mexico that we acquired a few years prior to that. So we've got a nice portfolio of opportunities that we continue to work on. And we don't go out and drill the wells until we're ready to drill them. But it's spread across a number of basins where there's good working oil and gas systems. And the Nargis discovery is a recent example of what happens when you focus in those areas, and I'm optimistic that we're going to see more of that in the future.\nPaul Sankey: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one is on the share count. Just going back to early 2022 of the period where you're stepping up the buyback program, but the dilution from the employee options are offsetting that rule. So I'm just trying to understand, I know you took a charge today in the corporate line. Do you expect 2023 dilution to be a similar level to 2022, or should it be lower? Just any sense on that would be helpful.\nPierre Breber: We expect fewer employee and retiree exercises of stock options. That was extraordinary unusual in the first quarter. And it's a zero-sum game. In other words, if employees and retirees do it early, there's fewer to do going forward. But that will be up to them and the stock price performance. And the share buybacks, I mean, you just divide it, depends on what our stock price is. We give guidance quarterly, and I think you can do the math. It is confusing the difference between average annual share count and where we end, right? So we are clearly taking our share count down. But when you look at average annuals, that's exactly what it implies. It's an annual each day, but the trend is going down. Our buybacks exceed the issuances and we expect that to continue.\nBiraj Borkhataria: That's very clear. And then second question is just thinking about asset sales. Looking at your guidance, 2023 plans are fairly muted. And I appreciate that you're basically at close to zero debt, so you don't actually need to do anything but in a high commodity price environment, maybe counter-cyclically, you might want to accelerate something. So is this a function of just the limited cleanup needed in the portfolio or a view on bid-ask spread or anything else, just to get your view on the asset sale market at the moment? Thank you.\nMike Wirth: Yeah. So Biraj, we are a little lower than what our typical level of guidance has been a level of activity. Over the last decade, we've generated about $35 billion in asset sales. So that's, say, 3.5%. There was some portfolio cleanup underway there that was needed to be done, and we get good value as we sold those. You're always looking at your tail. There's always -- when you sell things off, there's a new part of your portfolio and say, okay, this sits at the margin. And so you're always challenging that. If we were to find interested buyers and some of the things that might fit better for others than they do for us, we could transact on that. This is -- the guidance that we've got right now and the things that are underway and in process is what we've put out there, and we'll update you if there's any changes to that.\nPierre Breber: And the only add, Biraj, we don't do asset sales to raise cash or to manage the balance sheet. We do it based on what Mike just said, high grading of the portfolio where we can get the best returns for capital projects that can compete for capital, some of the impairments that we took in the fourth quarter are a result and outcome of projects that are good projects. They're just not good enough to clear the bar. So it does ebb and flow a little bit as Mike has said, but I just want to be clear, we do it as part of our capital discipline and having driving higher returns and lower carbon. It's an outcome of that. It ebbs and flows. It's a little low this year. We set it to go back higher in future years.\nRoderick Green: Thanks Biraj. I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-10-28 14:43:15", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference facilitator for today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.\nRoderick Green: Thank you, Sarah. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I will now turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Wirth: Thank you, Roderick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We continue to see a challenging and dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Current events highlight the importance of balancing economic prosperity, energy security and environmental protection. In line with these 3 imperatives, Chevron remains focused on our objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. During the third quarter, we continued to make progress by delivering return on capital employed in the mid-20s, returning more than $5 billion to shareholders for the second quarter in a row and investing to grow both our traditional and new energy businesses. Earlier this week, we released our methane report with specific disclosures about our aim to be a leader in methane emissions management. Our goal is simple: keep methane in the pipe. I encourage you to read our report available on chevron.com. Our strategy remains clear and consistent. Our results keep getting better. While future market conditions are uncertain, we're well positioned to deliver value to our shareholders in any environment. With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Mike. Third quarter financial results were strong. Included in the quarter were $177 million of pension settlement costs and positive foreign currency exchange effects of $624 million. The appendix of this presentation contains a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. We repurchased shares at the high end of our guidance range and ended the quarter with a net debt ratio under 5%. Cash CapEx was $3 billion, up over 50% from last year. For the sixth consecutive quarter, Chevron's free cash flow exceeded $5 billion. We're on track to beat 2021's free cash flow record. Adjusted third quarter earnings were up more than $5 billion versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations partially offset by inventory timing impacts. In Other, tax benefits are more than offset by higher operating expenses and other costs. Adjusted Downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining margins and favorable inventory timing impacts. The planned turnaround at our Richmond refinery was a driver of higher OpEx and lower volumes for the period. In Other, lower chemicals earnings were partly offset by higher trading gains. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down modestly. Adjusted Upstream earnings increased primarily on higher liftings and tax benefits, partially offset by higher charges for abandonment accruals and exploration leases. Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased primarily on lower refining margins and lower volumes and higher OpEx due to the Richmond planned turnaround. Partially offsetting is a favorable swing in timing effects. Third quarter oil equivalent production was flat compared to a year ago. Growth in the Permian, along with the absence of turnarounds and Hurricane Ida impacts were offset by the expiration of our contracts in Thailand and Indonesia and the sale of our Eagle Ford asset.  Now looking ahead, in the fourth quarter, we expect modest turnaround. After producing a record number of LNG cargoes in third quarter, we expect fewer spot cargoes out of Australia due to maintenance and summer temperatures. In the third quarter, we received a dividend from Angola LNG. In the fourth quarter, we expect dividends from TCO and Angola LNG, and we expect to end 2022 at the top end of our full year guidance for affiliate dividends. As a reminder, Chevron pays a 15% withholding tax on TCO dividends that lowers earnings and cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we will pay over $700 million associated with the early termination of a long-term LNG regas contract at Sabine Pass. This payment was accrued previously through working capital. Also, we expect to buy back shares at the top end of our guidance range. In closing, the third quarter showed again how Chevron's higher returns, lower carbon objective creates value for all of our stakeholders. Back to you, Roderick.\nRoderick Green: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Sarah, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Perfect. Sorry about that. You think I'd have that right by now. Our first question is on U.S. production growth. So either Mike or Pierre, the Permian was relatively flat quarter over quarter, averaged a little under 700,000 a day so far this year. Given industry dynamics and supply chain challenges, can you provide an update on how operations are going? And I guess what we noticed is that with only 1 quarter left in the -- left for the year, it looks like you'll be closer to the lower end of the 700,000 to 750,000 guidance range. And so we're just wondering if that's by design or if there's external factors driving that because we also noticed this morning, one of your integrated peers in the Permian lowered their '22 growth expectations.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Jeanine, my numbers say year-to-date, Permian production, a little over 700,000 barrels a day, up about 15% from first 3 quarters of last year, which was just a touch over 600. So we're seeing good growth. And for the quarter itself, production was up about 10% at 708,000 barrels a day versus 646 in the same quarter last year. I think the thing that some people may miss is during the pandemic, drilled but uncompleted well inventories really grew.  And rightfully so, we didn't need to frac wells and bring them online when there was declining demand for the production. So -- and we kept some drilling going. So that inventory grew. As we went back to work, the first thing we did was send completion crews out and start to bring the DUCs online. And you saw that through the back half of last year and certainly the first part of this year, which may have misled a little bit in terms of the rate of growth because this was this kind of surge capacity. We're back to [factory] (ph) drilling now. Our DUC inventory is kind of in line with what our plan would suggest it would be. And so we're seeing production level out at a growth rate that is more the kind of underlying rate that you should see. So we likely will be towards the lower end of the range. We get some non-ratable bookings from our non-operated joint ventures. We give you a range because we expect to be in the range, but we don't always hit the high end of the range. So in this case, we'll be towards the lower end. But we're not changing guidance for this year or our forward guidance.\nPierre Breber: And Jeanine, I'll just add, that low end of the range, it represents 15% year-on-year growth. So that's very strong growth.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Agreed. Thank you for that clarification. Maybe, Pierre, just sticking with you here. In terms of your comments earlier this morning, I think I caught it in an article that '23 CapEx would be at the top end of the $15 million to $17 million medium-term guidance range. There's a lot of moving pieces, and I don't know if you're going to talk about this because you'll have to -- you'll release it in a month or so. But the most obvious moving pieces that we see next year are that TCO spend starting to roll off, and some of that will be absorbed by the Permian, which we know is going to garner some more capital next year. So our question is, is capital trending to the higher end of that range? Is that more a reflection of Chevron responding to the macro environment? Or was that always part of the plan? And maybe just some inflation is pushing the capital a little higher?\nPierre Breber: It was always part of the plan for us to increase investment coming out of COVID, as Mike just spoke about. We're in the final stages of approving our business plan and our capital budget. And as you said, we'll announce that in December. You should expect it to be near the top end of the range, again, consistent with what our plans have been. We're going to increase in the Permian and in other locations. We do have some cost inflation that is also -- will contribute to that. We'll share all those details when we announce in December. And that's about a 20% increase in next year relative to where we think we'll end up this year. So year-to-date, we're a little bit below our capital budget on an organic basis. And so that will result in about a 20% increase, which is very, again, in line with our guidance and consistent with increasing investment and growing energy supplies.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: The first question was around Kazakhstan, and Mike, would just love your perspective on how you're viewing the assets out there, both the development of Tengiz? And then as you think through vacating barrels via the CPC pipeline?\nMichael Wirth: Sure. So I'll start with the project. We're on track to complete bulk construction by the end of this year. No change to our cost or schedule guidance, we're 97% complete on construction right now. There's still a lot of work to be done, but the risk and uncertainty are certainly narrowing and the remaining risks tend to be smaller in scale and potential impact. So we're moving into commissioning systems testing and start-up activities. We built a new integrated operations control center that I visited, which is fully operational with systems online. Our drilling program is complete. The final metering station is online. So very good progress on the construction side, and we'll continue to update you as we progress toward WPMP, the pressure management startup indicated right now for second half of '23 and then the future growth project in '24. On the CPC and the pipeline, there are no constraints on our ability to move barrels on that line. We've flowed everything out that we've been producing. And you've probably seen the media reports that a couple of the single-point moorings are offline right now for some repairs. So the buoyancy system, those repairs are underway and expected to be completed shortly. So at this point, everything flowing and it looks like we'll continue to do so.\nNeil Mehta: And Mike, you spent many years as a down-streamer as well and have great perspective on the global refining system. I don't think I ever thought that the cracks would be up here. So just love your perspective of where we are in terms of the refining market, how do we work our way through the bottlenecks that seem to be existing in the system and what that means for your Downstream business?\nMichael Wirth: Sure. It's been an interesting couple of years in the refining sector, Neil. With COVID, we actually saw through that period of time, some refineries shut down around the world that maybe at a rate greater than we would have expected before as the economics really collapsed, as demand collapsed. There were -- been some refineries in the U.S. that have been taken offline after storm damage or operating incidents that are not coming back. We see others being converted to renewable diesel. And so you had a constraint or a reduction in refining capacity that occurred over the last couple of years in a way we really haven't seen previously. And the other thing that happened is some of the new builds that are in various stages of development, primarily in the Middle East or Asia, slowed down during COVID. And a lot of the industry slowed activity until we had a better view on how we were going to come through that period of time. I think those will come back into developments and eventually online which will ease some of these global constraints. But the system is tight right now. And what you see is when you have some maintenance that runs along, some unplanned events, as we've seen on the West Coast, or when you see things like the strike that we've seen in France here recently, markets tighten up really quickly. And that sends a price signal to try to bring supplies in from further away. And so the entire refining complex right now is a little more tightly balanced than it historically has been. And I think in the short term, if you want to call that the next year, plus or minus, probably stays that way, maybe a little bit longer to some degree. And then I think as you see some of this new capacity come online, we get back into a situation where it's not quite as finely balanced as it is today. But to no doubt, we're in a market that we really haven't seen probably in my career in terms of the overall tightness on supply and demand.\nOperator: And our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Just thinking about your buyback range, $5 billion to $15 billion. 3Q is a strong quarter from a fundamental perspective, but maybe feels more repeatable to me than as an upside case than 2Q did. In 3Q, you still generated free cash flow well in excess of both your dividend and the buyback at the top end of the range. So my question is do you think you could go further than the $15 billion at the top end, given you still have a good amount of deleveraging happening at this point in the cycle, it doesn't seem quite as extraordinary as 2Q did.\nMichael Wirth: Yes. John, we've actually increased our rate of buybacks 3 times this year. We announced the first one at the end of last year. So we've steadily moved the range up and the rate of repurchases up. And so we're at an all-time high in terms of the rate of share repurchases. And you're right. We've got strong cash flow right now, which allows us to support all of our financial priorities and maintain the strong balance sheet. I think the thing that I just would reemphasize is we want to maintain the buyback program throughout the cycle. And we're not procyclical. We're not countercyclical. We want to operate across the cycle so that our shareholders see consistency out of us and know that they can count on that. And so we're positioned in a way where we're confident we can maintain that. And we regularly reassess it as our view on our business and commodity markets continues to evolve. And so we'll continue to do that and apprise you of anything further. Pierre, do you want to add anything to that?\nPierre Breber: I'll just point out that we increased our dividend 6% earlier this year. We've been growing our dividend at a compounded annual growth rate of 6% for 15 years. And that is our first financial priority. So there's a lot of tension on the buyback, but it's clearly our fourth priority after sustaining and growing the dividend, investing to grow both traditional and new energy businesses, maintaining a strong balance sheet. And as Mike said, we intend to do it across the cycle for multiple years.\nJohn Royall: Great. And then just looking at your bridge for international upstream, and I think Pierre may have mentioned in his remarks as well. You have this tailwind about $300 million from tax. Is that an impact from country mix? Or are there other moving pieces we should think about there? And should we think about this as sustainable?\nPierre Breber: In terms of international upstream, the benefit in the third quarter was primarily around a record LNG cargoes out of Australia, primarily Gorgon and Wheatstone are very happy to see that. It was a time when the world needed the energy. And again, a lot of that is under long-term contracts, but that included cargoes in the spot market, which we know we're at high prices. So we signaled that we expect of fewer LNG cargoes in the fourth quarter because during the summer temperatures in the southern hemisphere is just how -- you just produce less. And then we do have a pit stop that is planned for 1 of our facilities. In terms of tax items, those are items that can be onetime in nature. And so I would not look for those to be necessarily repeating.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Maybe just to ask a question that kind of ties a little bit into the question on the Permian. Maybe as you said, lower end in the non-op portion and the CapEx discussion. But just a broad question on inflation and not just inflation in the price sense, but some of the productivity challenges that come when you start getting busier. I mean you've got as good a global footprint as anybody. I'm just curious how you'd characterize that as you look across? And is there -- is it becoming more challenging to mitigate some of those issues?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. Roger, the -- I'd like to tell people we plan our work and work our plan. And so we've indicated for -- frankly, if you go back to pre COVID, our trajectory is that we pretty much have stayed right on even with the interruption of COVID. And so in terms of contracting for rigs, completion crews, pipe, sand, you name it, we tend to have a longer-term visibility into that. We commit to our service providers earlier, and that can result in both quality and availability of people, equipment, et cetera. So we don't see any meaningful constraints on our ability to execute our program. Certainly, we are seeing some cost inflation. And the Permian is probably the strongest that we see around the world, kind of into the low double digits year-on-year. In other parts of our portfolio, the cost pressures are probably a little bit less and the constraints aren't quite as pressing. So I think you'll see a little bit of that in our capital guidance as it comes out as we wrap up our planning and we look to next year. And I do think that it is probably a very real, I don't want to call it a governor, but a constraint on industry, the pace of industry activity and ramp up as we get into the next year. You'll hear other people talking about it from their point of view, and I'll let them comment, but yes, it's very real. And we've seen this movie before. In the Permian, we've seen it up in the oil sands a decade earlier. And in a cyclical business, this is a part of it.\nRoger Read: Yes, for sure. Follow-up question. Renewable natural gas RNG, we saw big acquisition announced here a few weeks ago on that front. You've been one of the leaders. And I was just curious, as you look at what's been going on in terms of some of the legislation that's come out federally as well as just the extent of the impact of the LCFS in California. Any updates we should think about in the RNG business. One of the things mentioned in that acquisition was the position that company already had in terms of -- I guess you'd call it leaseholds, right, on landfills and stuff and just characterize kind of where you are relative to where you want to be and to where maybe this competitor is setting up.\nMichael Wirth: Sure. We feel very good about where we are. We're a leader in RNG, leveraging strengths across the entire value chain, from feedstock to customer. We've been a partner of choice for a lot of the dairy farmers. We've got a strong brand to pull through. We've got a really strong market position in California where the LCFS provides the strongest incentives for this. So we like the position that we've built up. We've got 75 CNG sites online are in progress right now through the retail side. So our efforts, we were an early mover and we've preferentially focused on dairy as opposed to landfill gas. So there certainly are others that are active in this area. I don't want to comment on how somebody else looks at things. I would just say, our business is up and running, and we're supplying customers today, not kind of planning out into the future and kind of banking on that. I mean we intend to grow it further, but it's a real business for us today and it's performing well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: So I wanted to stick with New Energies first. And a few weeks ago, there was an announcement that you joined a consortium to look at a hydrogen and ammonia project in the Gulf Coast. So I was wondering if you could talk in a little bit more detail around that. And then more broadly, with the Inflation Reduction Act passage, how you're thinking about the opportunity set in your New Energies platform over the next few years?\nMichael Wirth: Sure. So we're excited about the announcements to work with a number of really good partners to try to develop hydrogen opportunities there on the Gulf Coast. One of the things I think you're going to see in these New Energies businesses as they evolve is we're going to have to build entire new value chains. And that means we're going to partner with different people who have expertise in different parts of these value chains and can bring technology, can bring customers, can bring experience to a venture that no one company necessarily would have all of that, but collectively, we can work with people that can build these new value chains. And so it's early days on many of these things, we're studying all the different opportunities in terms of blue hydrogen, green hydrogen, there's a lot of different colors that are possible as you get down into the details of it. And it will require significant investments. So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here. This is to really develop well-informed perspectives on the investment opportunities, the business models and ultimately, how we would build the business up there. But it's exciting. They're high-quality partners that we are working with. And I think you'll see more of these efforts announced here. We've got a lot of it that we're working on around the world, not just here in the U.S.\nDevin McDermott: Great. Look forward to seeing the additional details there over time. My second question is actually on M&A and just consolidation. And if you think back over the last few years, you've had a great track record, the Noble deal in 2020 REGI more recently. Wonder if you could talk a little bit more about how you're viewing the landscape for further acquisitions, upstream, downstream and even New Energies going forward.\nMichael Wirth: Sure, Devin. So we're always looking. We've got an evergreen process where we scan all the different sectors that are of interest to us. And so we watch companies, we watch sectors, we watch opportunities. Although we've had a pretty high bar, which is why we've only done a few deals. And as you say, we feel like the deals we've done are likely to turn out well. We've got a strong portfolio. We've got a really strong base case. And so we don't need to do a deal unless it really improves on what we expect to deliver otherwise. So I would just say we're going to continue to be very disciplined. We don't have an open checkbook even when times are good like this, especially when times are good like this. We walked away from a deal a few years ago rather than chase value out of it. We've sold assets out of our portfolio at well times. And as you say, the last couple of deals were done at a pretty good time. So over time, I think in the oil and gas business, there's likely to be some more consolidation. You need fewer and stronger companies that normally happens at the bottom of the cycle rather than at the top of the cycle. In New Energies, there's a lot of activity, to Devin's question, and I think there's a very active market out there where you could see some things come together because nobody has all the pieces. And I think as you look at building these businesses, we're going to find combinations probably are necessary to actually begin to put those pieces together. But we're going to be disciplined as we have been all along. And if we do anything, we'll come out to explain to you how it's going to create value for shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Mike or Pierre, maybe I've got one for each of you guys, and I'll go to Pierre first. So Pierre, I think you've been -- both of you guys have been very clear about managing the buyback through the cycle. And I think we all probably agree that your breakeven is not one of the best in the industry. But you still end up building a ton of cash and your share price is at, I guess, pretty close to an all-time high. So I'm just curious, the last thing you had this situation, you had multiple parallel projects going on to manage almost close to a net debt 0 balance sheet. What's to prevent you from building cash on the balance sheet and being opportunistic, whether it be through M&A or whether it be a cyclical opportunity to buy back your shares at a low level? I'm just curious how you think about that.\nPierre Breber: We've had a philosophy that goes back a long time and a track record. Again, I think that speaks for itself, 35 years of dividend increases, again, compounding at 6% for the last 15 years. Our investments in our traditional new energy growing both our guidance on upstream production growth is 3% compounded. We're now the second largest bio-renewable diesel producer in the country with our REGI acquisition. And when we generate cash in excess of that, it first goes to the balance sheet. So we've been very clear that our stated net debt ratio is between 20% to 25%. That's still a very strong balance sheet. If you recall, as we entered COVID, we were the only company that showed a stress test at $30 Brent and our net debt ratio was going to go into the low 30s if in fact, we would have had 2 years at 30. But that would have been where many of our peers started into COVID. So we've always maintained a strong balance sheet, and we think that's appropriate over the cycle to be in that range. But we're well below that. Our net debt is under 5%. So that's just a function of cash coming in and our just commitment to not be procyclical, we could have a larger buyback program today. Absolutely, if we wanted to just peg our net debt ratio at a higher level. But I think our shareholders would appropriately question that strategy as not being across the cycle. So we're setting the buyback at a level that allows us to maintain it across the cycle when prices do correct. We'll continue to buy back shares near the top end of the range that we've been talking about. In terms of acting countercyclically, in terms of M&A or any kind of major capital project, we have the capacity to do that at all kinds of balance sheets. We've shown that on M&A, we use equity because we think it makes a lot of sense. There's oil price risk in any kind of transaction so we don't need to do it all with cash. It will come with debt very likely. So we want to have some capacity but using equity in oil deals makes a lot of sense. And again, we have a great portfolio of projects, but we've shown a 10-year profile in addition to our 5-year guidance where the growth continues. We have a lot of great projects to choose from. The goal here is to sustain and grow the enterprise with the lowest capital possible. We're more capital and cost efficient than we've ever been. We've talked about that. And we're not really paid for growth by the market. So we're growing at very appropriate rates, strong rates for the next 5 years. And again, we've shown beyond that, but we certainly have the balance sheet and the capability to do more if we think, again, as Mike said, it's in the interest of our shareholders.\nDoug Leggate: Mike, I hate to put you in the spot, but you have the privilege or the challenge, I guess, of meeting with administration recently. I asked this question to your larger peer earlier today. And I'm just curious if you would care to share your thoughts on some of the potential legislative risks that might face the industry. And I guess, at a big picture level, I'm curious whether if you feel that the kind of ESG pendulum from an investor standpoint is beginning to swing back in your favor? Just that any thoughts you may care to share on that.\nMichael Wirth: Sure, Doug. So look, when we meet with policymakers, including those in the administration, what I talk about is the importance in energy of balancing economic prosperity, energy security and environmental protection. And all 3 of those things matter. Economic prosperity is affordable energy underpins the ability of the economics or economies to thrive. Reliable energy is tied to national security, and we're seeing that play out in different parts of the world today. And then, of course, there are the concerns about the environmental impacts of energy production and energy use, and we have to take those very seriously as well. And so my message to the policymakers is to be sure that we consider the appropriate balance of all 3 of those in policy because if you over-index on just one, you can create unintended consequences and vulnerabilities that may not manifest themselves for a little while, but they're there. And eventually, they do materialize. And so I'm a believer that we share a lot of common ground with governments around the world as we talk about these issues. We share common ground with our investors who are concerned about these things as well. And so look, we've been doing ESG for a long time. I keep a book on my desk called the Standard Oil Spirit that was written in 1923. And it talks about our commitment to people, it talks about our commitment to protecting the environment. And this has been in the ethos of the company forever, and it's evolved as society has evolved. And so we're committed to being a responsible company and being a part of the solution here in the U.S. and around the world.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Maybe one follow-up question on biofuels, on the liquid side of the biofuels market. Could you maybe provide an update how you're seeing the liquid biofuels market maybe relative to your expectations, particularly with a little time with the REG acquisition under your belt? You're expanding pretreatment in Germany, Europe pitching things towards sustainable aviation fuel. So how is the market playing out relative to your expectations? How do you see the past issue playing out between U.S. and Europe? And then maybe any update on the progress of the Geismar renewable diesel facility that you acquired from REG?\nMichael Wirth: Sure. So I'll start with the REG acquisition. The assets are good, the people are little better. Any surprises so far have been to the upside. We've already identified quick wins, commercial opportunities. We've lowered insurance and financing costs. Integration efforts are all on track and delivering on our expectations. We're seeing placement of biodiesel in the Chevron's West Coast refining or in the marketing network, and that continues to ramp up. We're optimizing freight and feedstocks across the system. So all of that builds on the strength that both companies had in the renewable fuels value chain. And we just see it as really a nice combination here. The Geismar expansion is underway, and we're halfway already to our renewable fuels target as that's completed. We indicated we're going to grow to 100,000 barrels a day. We're well on our way to do that. And of course, we're investing in other relationships. We've got a joint venture with Bunge, where we're now participating in the soybean crush spread and bringing feedstocks into the system. We're working on converting hydro processing capacity at some of our refineries to be able to run bio feedstocks. So this is a part of our business that will grow the economics on it, like anything in the downstream or a function of feedstock costs, supply demand in markets. But they've been good so far, and we expect across the cycle and out into time that they're going to continue to be an important part of our portfolio. We are seeing more people go into renewable diesel. It's a market that, like any other commodity market at times may get long and margins may reflect that. But we're familiar with those dynamics from our traditional business.\nRyan Todd: Thanks, Mike. Maybe one more. Just maybe a little speculative, but any thoughts on what you think the impact of a Russian product import ban to Europe on how that could play out in terms of product flows? Are those barrels likely to find a home in Latin America or Africa? Or do you think that we may actually see a decent amount of that Russian product disappear from the market?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. Any of these export bans have to be looked at within the context of the broader market. And as you say, just as we've seen on crude, where the U.S. has managed the import of Russian crude Europe hasn't yet that's coming. And -- but it's a global market. And you've got other buyers that need -- they need the products and they're not participating in the sanctions necessarily. And so going to the earlier question from Neil about the products side of the business, markets are tight right now. Diesel, in particular, as we've seen here recently and likely to stay that way through the winter, I think. Further, we get into the first quarter when the products ban comes into effect in Europe. And I think that's going to be set against a backdrop of pretty tight product markets, and you are going to find countries around the world need that fuel. And you get into logistics then, you've got longer shipping legs, which do you have enough ships to move it and how do you -- how does the system reoptimize? It's a less efficient optimization for sure than moving it to the natural closer markets. But I do think that you'll see those products continue to flow although just go to more distant markets with increased costs and logistics and continue to keep some of this pressure on the overall balances out there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Lucas Herrmann with Exane.\nLucas Herrmann: Two, if I might. The first for you, Pierre. Just remind me, in terms of the associate contribution towards the top end of the range, I think the indication was $3 billion at the top end of the range, but perhaps you could give us an indication of the level of dividend that's been paid out to associate to date. And I guess I'm a little surprised that in the current environment, one might expect that the associate dividend would be beyond the $3 billion? And then, Mike, just if you could just give us a whirlwind tour or it's not whirlwind, but just talk around the Gulf the developments that are taking place there within your own portfolio and how those are proceeding and your current thoughts on timing. That'd be great.\nMichael Wirth: Okay. I'll let Pierre start, and then when I come back, I'll just ask you to clarify, Gulf of Mexico or...\nLucas Herrmann: Sorry, Gulf of Mexico. Yes, no, Gulf of Mexico.\nMichael Wirth: Okay. Very good.\nLucas Herrmann: You're welcome to talk about both, Mike.\nPierre Breber: Lucas, you're right that affiliate dividends at last quarter, we guided to be above the top end of the range, and now we're guiding at the top end of the range, which we increased during the course of the year. And that reflects really 2 items. Angola LNG has in the affiliate income line, been generating earnings all year, but during the first half of the year, the cash return was a return to capital and the dividend. And so it's showing up in a different part of the cash flow statement. And then the second item is, given the uncertainty at CPC, TCO is holding more cash. We'll get more cash out of TCO. But I think TCO appropriately is just being cautious. As Mike said, all of our barrels are flowing. In October, we expect them all to flow. In November, we expect the repairs to be completed shortly. That said, they're just being cautious and holding a little higher cash balances. So we'll be at the top end of the range through 3Q, I think we're at about $2 billion of affiliate dividends. You can confirm that with Roderick. But the reason why you're seeing that the cash flow line of affiliate income less dividends being a little bit larger than maybe you'd expect, it's primarily those 2 drivers in terms of the quirks of Angola LNG accounting and TCO holding cash balances, which will be a temporary thing, and we expect that, that we'll see higher cash in the future from them.\nMichael Wirth: Okay. Gulf of Mexico, Lucas, as you know, we're one of the largest leaseholders in the Gulf. We've got over 270 leases out there and a strong base business, a lot of installed infrastructure that enables capital-efficient brownfield development. And importantly, it's one of the most carbon-efficient assets in our portfolio with a carbon intensity of about 6 kilograms of CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent. Lease Sale 257 is the one that was in question. Here a few months ago, as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, that's been clarified and that lease sale is proceeding. We picked up 34 leases in that sale. And we look forward to continued leasing by the federal government as indicated and kind of encouraged by the Inflation Reduction Act, and we'll participate in those. In terms of production growth, we will advance a number of projects that are underway right now. Jack St. Malo has a multiphase pumping project that starts up this year and some additional development drilling. Bigfoot has ongoing development drilling and water injection that will begin in the first quarter of next year.  Mad Dog 2 is operated by one of our partners, and I would refer you to them for an update on that project. We've got at St. Malo, our waterflood first injection plan for next year. Anchor a new greenfield project. We expect first oil on that in 2024. Whale, another greenfield project operated by one of our partners. I expect first oil on that towards the end of 2024. And then we recently took FID in the second quarter of this year on the Ballymore project and expect first oil on that one in 2025. So I appreciate the question because oftentimes, I hear people say, well, we can see the Kazakhstan growth. We can see the Permian. What else do you have? We've got a string of projects there in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico that are kind of sequentially lined out that will steadily contribute to production growth here in the U.S. from the deepwater.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: I've got two left, please. First one is just going back to Kazakhstan and CPC. My understanding is there's been sort of fortuitous timing for Tengiz because one of the other projects in Kazakhstan has been offline, which has allowed Tengiz to flow despite the capacity obviously being lower. So I was just trying to understand, hypothetically, if Kazakh production comes back up to full capacity, but the pipeline capacity is maintained to be reduced or is not at full capacity? Then do all the projects get pro rata down equally? Or is there any other quirks that we need to be aware of there as it relates to Tengiz? And then the second question is on your LNG portfolio, performed extremely strong this quarter. Can you say what proportion of your LNG portfolio is sold under long-term contracts? And what portion is sold on a spot basis, either for the year or over the medium term?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. So at CPC, I mentioned earlier that right now, only 1 of the 3 single point moorings is operational. The other 2 are down for some maintenance and repair work that's well underway. And so we would expect that work to be completed and to be able to handle full flows on CPC here before too long. If for some reason that didn't happen, and we were constrained to the 1 SPM, that has the capacity to load out about 70% of what CPC can move when it's operating full. So there would be some constraints on movements. TCO has long been the initial, the largest and in many ways I think the most important shipper on that line and that's reflected in some of the practices that I don't want to get into the details, but we would still be able to flow barrels, maybe not all of our barrels, but I think TCO would be well positioned to not be disadvantaged, let me say that, if there were some sort of proration underway.\nPierre Breber: I'll just add that the nominations for CPC for November have already been put in place and Tengiz TCO essentially got a full nomination even for November. And again, that's even in a situation if the SPMs are not repaired. Of course, if they're repaired by then, fine issue, but even if they stay down for November, TCO has already received a full nomination. On the LNG question Biraj, it's notionally around 80% contracted, 20% spot. That's a combination of both of our Australia LNG operations and our West Africa operations. Our West Africa tends to be almost all spot and Australia is closer to 90-10. So that averages out to about 80-20. And we'll give guidance on our spot price sensitivity. We'll do that in the fourth quarter call at the end of January. It depends on how many spot cargoes are produced, both out of, again, our West Africa and Australia operations.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Irene Himona with SocGen.\nIrene Himona: Congratulations on the very strong results. My first question, your financial framework is clearly to manage through the cycle. But at the same time, the current uncertainty on the commodity price outlook is rather extreme, and that is partly because of the risks or fears of a recession. So my question is, as you look at your Downstream businesses, whether in the U.S. or Asia, have you seen any signs of an economic slowdown which would cause you some concern as you look ahead to 2023 and which might perhaps drive a more conservative approach to CapEx growth?\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Irene, thanks. Demand remains pretty strong globally across the product. Now there are some variations in that. Certainly, the U.S. West Coast, which had some refining issues and prices reflected that. We saw gasoline demand in the third quarter, responsive to those higher prices and a little bit of softness there.  Diesel demand has been pretty strong around the world, maybe a little less so in China, given some of the lockdowns that they're seeing. And aviation demand has been steadily coming back as people are flying again not quite to pre-COVID levels yet, but steadily increasing. And so overall, I wouldn't say that product demand that we've seen to date is sending a strong signal that a recession is underway or that the economy is significantly slowing. As I said, there's always some kind of regional or maybe sectoral unique characteristics. But no, we're not really seeing that yet, Irene.\nIrene Himona: My supplementary question, if I can go back to renewable natural gas, please. LCSS prices have more or less halved over the last year. I wonder if you can help us understand the impact, if any, on your own R&D. Does it create some pressures to perhaps work more on the technology to try and reduce the costs, given that the value of the incentive is half what it was last year?\nMichael Wirth: Sure. So let me set the incentive aside for a second. In every one of our Downstream businesses, we're always working on reducing costs and improving technology and finding ways to become more efficient. And so that's inherent in our business. The dynamics around LCFS credits, RINs, AB32 credits in California, the EU trading scheme. All of these things, we have to manage through their own cycles. And it's a part of our business that is related to but not necessarily correlated to the fundamental supply-demand dynamics that drive physical flows because you have government allocations of credits and whether people are building inventories or credits or drawing down inventories of these credits. And so they don't necessarily correlate with the underlying commodity. And we've got a fair amount of experience in managing that. Certainly, the economics on something like RNG rely on the credit structure and the regulatory framework that incentivized those businesses. And if you see the credits declining in value that it starts to erode a little bit of the margin in that business. We have to take a long-term view on these things. And I think the regulators do the same. And as they see credit values reflect a lot of length in credits, that suggests that the technology is advancing, the supply is advancing and they can set more ambitious targets. And so these things evolve over time. And I think our people have a pretty good track record of managing in that environment.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Mike and Pierre, one question for each. First is a simple one. In the past in your presentation, when you're talking about Downstream, we talk about what's the chemical earning sequentially, whether they are up or down. You didn't mention in your presentation at this time. Does that means that chemical earnings is actually relatively flat, which is surprising given how much is the margin drop we've seen in the industry. So that's the first question. Second question on Mike, is for the LNG longer-term strategy. most of your peers that have been pretty aggressive in growing their LNG operation, you have very possible or at least very cash flow rich LNG operation, but you don't really have much time to grow at least on the table. Can you maybe elaborate that what is your longer-term -- medium- to longer-term strategy in LNG.\nMichael Wirth: Sure, Paul. Yes, quickly on chemicals, earnings were a little bit lower quarter-on-quarter. And that's really a function of margins. We had higher ethane prices and lower polyethylene prices. And so the olefins margins, which is the largest driver of our performance were squeezed. So it did go down sequentially.  On LNG strategy, we've long favored the Pacific Basin, given the best customers were in Japan, Korea, Taiwan markets and our resource position in the Pacific. The Atlantic Basin, we've got exposure to it. But Europe traditionally has been a market where you were competing with Russian pipe gas and just less attractive. With the changes now that we see in markets, we're increasing exposure to Atlantic Basin LNG. We've done a couple of deals with Gulf Coast projects that are being developed that will give us offtake that we can move into global markets. And then we're advancing projects in the Eastern Mediterranean and the assets that were acquired with the Noble acquisition, that would potentially allow an expansion of the Leviathan field to provide LNG supply that can go into global markets. We've looked at other things. So the big process has been underway in cutter. We certainly were deeply involved in evaluating that opportunity. Like everything that we look at, LNG has to compete against the other investment opportunities in our portfolio. We're going to stay very disciplined on capital and we won't invest in everything that we could. We're going to invest in the best things that we can. And I expect that will include some LNG projects over time.\nRoderick Green: I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call today. Please stay safe and healthy. Sarah, back to you.\nOperator: This concludes Chevron's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-07-29 15:55:14", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.\nRoderick Green: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings conference call and webcast. I am Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our CFO, Pierre Breber; and EVP of Upstream, Jay Johnson, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thank you, Roderick, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We delivered another strong quarter, another quarter of strong financial results with ROCE over 25%, the highest since 2008. Special items this quarter include asset sale gains of $200 million and a $600 million charge to terminate early a long-term LNG regas contract at Sabine Pass. C&E for the quarter was nearly $4 billion, including inorganic spend to form our JV with Bunge. With the acquisition of REG, our total investment was $6.8 billion, more than double last year\u2019s quarter. Strong cash flow enabled us to fund this higher level of investment, pay down debt for the fifth consecutive quarter and returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Adjusted second quarter earnings were up more than $8 billion versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations partially offset by lower liftings from the end of concessions in Indonesia and Thailand. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining margins. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were up nearly $5 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher realizations, partially offset by tax and other items, including higher withholding taxes on TCO dividends and cash repatriations. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining margins and a favorable swing in timing effects. The All Other segment was up due in part to a favorable change in the valuation of stock-based compensation. I will now turn it over to Jay.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Pierre. Second quarter oil equivalent production decreased about 7% year-on-year due to expiration of our contracts in both Indonesia and Thailand, the sale of our Eagle Ford asset and CPC curtailments impacting TCO during April. This was partially offset by shale and tight growth, primarily in the Permian. In the Permian, we are delivering on our objectives of higher returns and lower carbon. Our development costs are down about 25% since 2019 and we expect to keep them flat this year by offsetting inflation with productivity improvements. An example of simul-frac where we perform completion activities on 4 wells at a time reducing cycle time by a quarter. We continue to design, construct and operate facilities to limit methane emissions. Two of our Midland Basin sites recently earned the highest ratings from Project Canary\u2019s independent certification program. Production is at record levels and growing in line with guidance with our royalty position, providing a distinct financial advantage for our shareholders. At TCO, the drilling program is complete and the final metering station is online. We expect to complete construction by year-end with remaining project activities, primarily focused on systems completion, commissioning and startup. Total project cost guidance is unchanged. WPMP startup is expected in the second half of next year and FGP expected timing remains first half of 2024. TCO\u2019s operations continue to generate strong cash flow, enabling a midyear dividend with project spend decreasing we are expecting higher dividends going forward. In Australia, we shipped 87 LNG cargoes from Gorgon and Wheatstone in the first half of this year, up over 10% from last year. Our reliability benchmarks in the first quartile and we intend to stay there with an ongoing focus on operational excellence. Gorgon Stage 2, the first backfill project is on track to deliver first gas in September. Our Gulf of Mexico projects are progressing well with Ballymore receiving FID as a tieback to Blind Faith, an example of leveraging our existing infrastructure to improve returns. The Anchor hull is currently sailing from Korea and work on its top sites continues in Texas. Lastly, we recently signed agreements to export 4 million tons a year of LNG from the U.S. Gulf Coast with 1.5 million tons a year expected to start in 2026. These agreements leverage our growing U.S. natural gas production and expand our value chains in Atlantic Basin markets. Now, back to you, Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Jay. We closed the REG acquisition last month and integration is going very well. We are pleased to welcome REG\u2019s talented employees to Chevron and CJ Warner to our Board. Our teams have already identified further commercial opportunities and we quickly acted to lower insurance and financing costs. In May, we launched our joint venture with Bunge. The JV is operating two existing crushers and evaluation work is underway to expand crush capacity and add pretreatment facilities. In carbon capture and storage, we closed on the expanded JV to develop the Bayou Bend CCS hub. The lease held by the JV is in Texas State Waters near large industrial emitters and we believe it is the first U.S. offshore lease dedicated to CCS. Also, we recently filed for a conditional use permit in Kern County, California to store CO2 emissions from one of our cogeneration plants. Now, looking ahead, in the third quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production in a number of locations. In downstream, planned turnarounds are primarily at our California refineries. We do not expect significant dividends from TCO or Angola LNG until the fourth quarter. Our full year guidance for affiliate dividends is unchanged, with upside potential beyond the top of the range depending on commodity prices. Also, we increased the top end of our share buyback guidance range to $15 billion per year and expect to be at that rate during the third quarter. In closing, we are executing our plans, increasing investment to grow both traditional and new energy supplies and delivering value to our stakeholders. Although commodity markets maybe volatile, our actions are consistent through the cycle and focus on our objectives to deliver higher returns and lower carbon. Back to you, Roderick.\nRoderick Green: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nJay Johnson: Good morning.\nDevin McDermott: Good morning. So Jay, I wanted to congratulate you on the retirement plans and take advantage of having you here on the call. My first one is on TCO and it\u2019s great to see the project progress there. And with the WPMP portion of the project largely complete, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the remaining milestones for that second phase FGP as you progress toward that first half 2024 startup?\nJay Johnson: Thank you, Devin, for both the retirement wishes and the question. For TCO, we have been just steadily making progress here and we had a very strong period in the first half of this year. We had the unrest in January, of course and then the team responded well after that even with some of the Omicron impacts. As we are finishing construction, we expect to finish construction on everything this year and be largely into the commissioning phase and this is largely putting together doing the pressure testing, filling with fluids, cleaning systems and preparing them for eventual startup. The WPMP that we expect in the second half of next year will be around enabling us to boost the pressure from the field up to the facilities. So we don\u2019t expect to see a material change in our production at that point in time, but it enables us then to move into the phase of startup for FGP, where we will start to see incremental production coming through the plant. And some of the big milestones we have already accomplished. All 40 production wells are already now produced and completed and actually producing into the plant that helps us with the transition from the high pressure to the low pressure phase. We have got the injection wells already completed, so we can begin the FGP startup. Field facilities are well underway in terms of the new gathering system. We will have about all the metering stations have to be converted to high pressure to low pressure. They will be done kind of one at a time, so we can maintain production through that period. So those are the \u2013 you won\u2019t see a lot of outward signs other than progress on the commissioning, the number of subsystems completed and that\u2019s really what we are moving into. Rather than percent complete, we are 93% complete overall now, what\u2019s going to be more important are just the rundown curves as we bring each system to completion.\nDevin McDermott: Great. Thank you. Very helpful and great progress there. And sticking with TCO in that part of your portfolio, there has been a lot of headlines around the CPC pipeline in recent weeks and months. I was just wondering if you could give us a status update on where things stand there? And then also to the extent that there were to be any further disruptions to flows on that pipe, can you talk a little bit about the impacts to operations for your base existing production in that area?\nJay Johnson: The CPC continues to be an important export route for us. It handles the majority of crude that\u2019s being exported to Western markets. And it represents an important supply to the world. It\u2019s about 1.4 million barrels of oil a day coming through that. The oil that we put into the line from Kazakhstan carries a certificate of origin from Kazakhstan. And we have done a lot of work in Washington and Brussels to make sure people understand the importance of the pipeline to world supplies. And we have seen the reliability overall still in the capacity to be able to maintain at the levels we need. The interruptions that we have seen have been managed. We have gotten through those. And as we look forward, we just continue to work with the Kazakh government and with the International Consortium that owns and operates the CPC pipeline to maintain this important source of \u2013 or export route for the crude. There are some alternate export routes being developed, but CPC remains the primary and most important route for us.\nDevin McDermott: Got it. Just to clarify, at the moment, operationally, at normal nameplate and flow rates through the pipe?\nJay Johnson: Yes, we are at full capacity both at TCO and through the CPC pipeline. They actually work quite well with us when they do have to take the pipeline down for ongoing maintenance, which all pipelines have to do from time to time. They coordinate with the producers. They are often coordinated with turnarounds that the producing facilities are undergoing. So, the recent downtime for CPC is they were dealing with some of the results of the survey work around the terminal was coordinated with the NCOC turnaround activities, so that it didn\u2019t have any impact at all on TCO\u2019s production.\nDevin McDermott: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, good morning, team. And Jay, thank you for all the insights over the years and wish you well in your retirement, sir.\nJay Johnson: Thank you.\nNeil Mehta: The first question is on capital returns and you guys raised the top end of the buyback guidance here. So just talk about the math that went into it and how you think about the optimal return of capital formation, whether it is through buybacks or dividend growth?\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Neil. It\u2019s Pierre. I will take that. I will go through our financial priorities. They have been consistent for decades literally. The first financial priority is to grow the dividend. We have done that for 35 consecutive years, increased it 6% earlier this year. It\u2019s up 20% since right before COVID and it\u2019s doubled since 2010. The second is to invest and grow both traditional and new energy and you saw that our total investments first half of the year were up 80% versus a year ago. The third is to maintain a strong balance sheet. For the fifth consecutive quarter, we paid down debt. Our net debt ratio is at 8%. That\u2019s well below our mid-cycle guidance of 20% to 25%. And when we have cash in excess of those first three priorities, we buyback shares and we intend to do it ratably over the cycle. We have repurchased shares, 50 now last 19 years. We bought back almost $60 billion during that time at an average price around $90 a share, very close to the weighted average price during that whole time. And as you said, we just increased the guidance to \u2013 we just increased the top of the range of our guidance to $15 billion a year. That represents about 1% of our shares each quarter. The $15 billion annual rate is based on our current outlook. It was tested against a number of scenarios. The rate is consistent with our Investor Day upside leverage case, which was a $75 Brent flat nominal price over 5 years. As we have said with previous buyback rates, we intend to maintain buybacks at this annual rate for a number of years across the commodity cycle. As a reminder, our net debt is well below our mid-cycle guidance range. So we will continue buybacks even when the commodity cycle turns down and we will lever back up our balance sheet closer to that 20% to 25% guidance range.\nNeil Mehta: Fair. The follow-up is just on the Permian. Can you just talk about how you are thinking about the growth profile there relative to what you guided at the beginning of the year, does the upward drift in commodity prices change the way you are thinking about prosecuting that asset?\nJay Johnson: Neil, I will start out with that and then Pierre can finish if he has got any other thoughts. The Permian \u2013 our approach to the Permian, as you know, for many years, has been to be very disciplined, very focused on generating the returns and the efficiency that allow us to be profitable regardless of the prices. And so we are not responding to short-term price, but we are increasing our activity levels since the turndown during COVID. And so we have seen our investment go up this year, it\u2019s $1 billion higher than it was last year. And we also see the number of wells that we are putting on production going up, we expect to do over 200 POPs this year. And so we are looking for about a 15% increase in our Permian production. We have increased 2 additional rigs in July. So we are running now with a fleet of 10 rigs across the Permian in the current time and we expect to maintain that through the second half. But I will remind you also one of our rigs today drills the equivalent of what two rigs could do in 2018. So using just rig counts is a little bit of a you have to be careful, because we are so much more efficient with our rigs. And each frac crew today is also completing roughly double the work they were doing back in 2018. So we are much more efficient than we were just 4 years ago. We expect to see our investment continue to grow. We have given you guidance of increasing our investment rate up to about $4 billion a year by 2024. And then I would expect to see it relatively flat after that as we just maintain an efficient operation across the Permian. We also have non-operated activity and we currently have about 9 net rigs running on the non-op side. And so that also contributes significantly to our production profile. Our guidance remains unchanged. We would expect to see about 1.2 million to 1.5 million barrels a day of production ultimately is our plateau. But as we continue to gain insights and knowledge and as we look at our efficiency, as we look at our portfolio and world demand that can change as we go forward. That\u2019s our guidance as we see it today and we will continue to update you as we move forward in time.\nPierre Breber: My only add is it\u2019s also among our most carbon-efficient barrels in the portfolio. And as Jay has said, it\u2019s a demonstration of our \u2013 delivering on our objectives of higher returns and lower carbon. Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Jay, we would also like to wish you well and thank you for all your time over the years and we\u2019ll stick to two upstream questions just so we can get to last in before you leave. Our first one is on LNG. This week, there was an announcement that Chevron along with a couple of other partners that you guys reached FID on development that will help boost Angola LNG plant volumes. So can you talk about how you\u2019re viewing expansion opportunities in Angola and also hit on Equatorial Guinea where you also have kind of an equity position that feeds an LNG plant there? And is there a preference on how your involvement evolves with LNG plants because you have some ownership \u2013 some equity ownership, but we also know that you had a Cheniere agreement that you announced recently that was more just on the marketing front. So just wondering how you\u2019re seeing your role there on new opportunities.\nJay Johnson: That was pretty good, Jeanine. I think you got three questions in there, and I\u2019m going to try and merge through those.\nJeanine Wai: No. That\u2019s just one.\nJay Johnson: I know. I\u2019m allowed to do that. I\u2019m the upstream guy. Look, on the LNG in Angola, you\u2019re right. We just took FID in the new gas consortium. There are two primary sources of gas for Angola LNG. Traditionally, it was built for the associated gas that\u2019s produced along with the oil resources in Angola. And that\u2019s been the main source of gas for Angola LNG up to this point. And we continue to develop new oil resources with our 20-year extension, just secured really good terms on both the oil and the gas. It encourages investment in that country. There is a lot of oil still in Block 0. So that continues unabated. And actually, the investment will move forward. The non-associated gas, in other words, drilling and developing reservoirs that are gas only is a new investment mode, and we\u2019re doing that through the consortium you mentioned. And that\u2019s designed to be supplemental gas so that we can keep the Angola LNG facilities full. And so the ongoing effort to keep that plant running, it\u2019s really economic because it builds on existing infrastructure that\u2019s already been built, the investments have already been made. And importantly, it\u2019s supplying needed LNG into the European market and also gives us exposure to that Atlantic Basin. So that\u2019s been a good project for us, and we\u2019re pleased to take that FID. In EG, again, we have exposure now to the Atlantic Basin through that project. We continue to produce there. There is not much more I can say other than that\u2019s also been a profitable area for us and it came to us through the Noble acquisition. So it was kind of one of those more hidden jewels. We talk about Eastern Med. We talk about the DJ Basin in particular. But EG is supplying a very good return to us through those gas and LNG facilities. In terms of our focus on ownership versus commercial, we\u2019re really pretty agnostic. We\u2019re looking for the returns and the scale that we can build out of the business. We\u2019re looking for multiple points of supply so that we can maintain an active and profitable portfolio. And so where we can do commercial deals and not have to use capital but to really be able to leverage other facilities, that\u2019s always a nice way for us to go, and I\u2019m pleased to get that exposure out of the Gulf Coast into both European and potentially Asian markets. It gives us an access for a lot of our produced gas in North America to access those markets rather than just U.S. But where it makes sense, we will also make investments as we have in other places and own the facilities or run them through joint venture facilities or non-operated facilities. We really look at what gives us the best to generate the returns we\u2019re looking for.\nJeanine Wai: Great. Thank you. We won\u2019t sneak in our unrelated follow-up since that was very fulsome response. Thank you.\nJay Johnson: Okay, thanks, Jeanine.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Jeanine.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. 41 years in one place, Jay, that\u2019s pretty impressive. Congratulations.\nJay Johnson: Thank you.\nDoug Leggate: I wonder if I could take maybe two questions for you, actually. Maybe Pierre might prefer the second one. I want to go to the Permian first. You have about half year production operated and half non-operated. Can you parse between the inflationary pressures between your operated and non-operated from what you\u2019re seeing currently?\nJay Johnson: It\u2019s difficult for me to really do that definitively. What I can say, though, is I think we have a competitive advantage in the Permian. We have a couple of things working in our favor. We maintain a global supply chain and we\u2019re able to tap suppliers of both equipment and materials, goods and services over a much broader range than maybe some of our competitors. We also do multiyear contracts and other mechanisms commercially that allow us to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we see today. And then, of course, our focus on driving for improved productivity, improved efficiency has really helped us continue to counter the inflationary pressures. I think the other area that we have a distinct advantage is we\u2019ve been building out our infrastructure in the Permian. And so just as a proof point, the last 800 wells over the last 5 years, to produce those 800 wells, we had to build 40 central tank batteries. As we look forward, the next 800 wells, we only need to build an additional four central tank batteries. So while others are having to invest in this high inflationary period, we\u2019re largely using infrastructure that was built over the past 5 years with very small incremental surface facilities required. And I think that\u2019s going to be hard for others to match.\nDoug Leggate: So that\u2019s a very clear answer. Thank you. Pierre, I don\u2019t know quite hard to ask this question. I\u2019m going to try and get a party and a part of you perhaps, I\u2019ll be respectful. Mike was interviewed recently talking about the tightness in the global oil market. I think you said something like I know to put words in his mouth, but any weakness in oil prices is going to be fleeting because of the under investment. And you guys obviously have stepped up your spending from COVID levels, but you\u2019re still well below pre-COVID levels \u201816 through \u201819, let\u2019s say. With your balance sheet where it is in the depth of opportunities that you obviously have that you\u2019re not funding, how should we think about your continued commitment to the current CapEx level? Or do we see Chevron reengage in organic growth at some point?\nPierre Breber: You should think that there is no change in our guidance. There is \u2013 our 2022 capital is on track. It\u2019s likely to end up below our $15 billion budget. We\u2019ve been ramping up during the course of the first half of the year, and I think you\u2019ll see us higher in the second half of the year, but likely end the year below our $15 billion budget. Our guidance that we shared at our March Investor Day is $15 billion to $17 billion of organic capital investments through 2026. Our budget this year is around $15 billion. So we have $2 billion of room to increase activity and investment within the guidance. And then as Jay just described, our major capital project in Kazakhstan is winding down, it will decrease spending by about $1 billion, and that opens up another $1 billion. So we have \u2013 we will increase investment in activity next year. I expect that we\u2019re doing that work right now. We will share the details in December when it\u2019s finalized and approved by the Board. But we will increase it within the guidance. And that guidance enables us to sustain and grow the Upstream business, as we\u2019ve talked about, 3% compounded annual growth rate between now and 2026. Add to our refinery capacity. We bought a refinery in Pasadena, Texas in 2019, kept all of our U.S. refineries through COVID and are making investment in that Pasadena refinery that was just recently FID. And of course, all the activities we\u2019re doing to grow new energies. We can do all of that within the guidance. And as we recognize, Jay, one of the things he deserves a lot of credit for is our upstream business is much more capital efficient than it\u2019s ever been. And has a mindset of how do we deliver business results with less capital. And if we do that, there is more free cash flow for shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about your growth in the Gulf of Mexico in the upstream? You\u2019re leaning in there with number of brownfield projects. So can you just speak broadly on how you view on within your portfolio? And how the returns look on those bolt-ons relative to your other options globally in the upstream? And then what does the service inflation picture look like in that part of your system relative to, say, the Permian?\nJay Johnson: Thank you, John. I\u2019ll start this and let Pierre add in. But we\u2019re really quite pleased with the portfolio we maintain in the Gulf of Mexico. It\u2019s a good area of exploration for us. And it has some of the lowest carbon intensity in the world. It\u2019s about 6 kilograms of equivalent per barrel produced. So on a world scale, and even our company scale, which is already top quartile, it\u2019s right at the bottom end of that range. So this is a great area to develop for future production and carbon efficiency. When we look at the queue of projects we have, we\u2019ve got the Anchor project that is expecting to have first half in 2024. We\u2019ve got Whale is coming through. We expect in 2024. We\u2019ve been expanding our existing facilities. We\u2019re starting up the Waterflood at St. Malo, which is part of the Jack St. Malo complex. We\u2019ve installed our multiphase pumps and are commissioning those. That\u2019s going to be an important milestone technologically and our ability to step out further and further. We just took FID at Ballymore. And Ballymore is an interesting one because it was a nice size discovery, but we could really capitalize and get a much higher return by taking three wells back to a host facility, at Blind Faith and be able to develop that. So we\u2019re pleased to be able to see that higher return coming from Blind Faith. And it also helps our existing production at Blind Faith. As we continue to work forward, I think we\u2019re going to see growth in our Gulf of Mexico production, but it\u2019s going to be important that we continue to be able to lease and acquire additional acreage in that basin, along with others because there is still, I think, room for continual exploration and tie back to this great chain of infrastructure that we have, be able to produce this lower carbon fuel.\nPierre Breber: Only add is our rigs were largely contracted when rates are lower. So clearly, offshore rigs have increased, but we\u2019re largely contracted at prior rates. Thanks, John.\nJohn Royall: Great, thank you. Yes. So on the downstream I just had a question on particularly California, just kind of your go-forward views there. Product balance is not quite as tight as they are in other parts of the country. But then we\u2019re seeing some capacity come out due to RD conversions there. And so just looking for maybe your medium-term view on refining and California specifically?\nPierre Breber: On the downstream side, we had a strong quarter. Well, good execution, reliable operations, high refinery utilization, and I\u2019m talking generally now, U.S. West Coast and Gulf Coast, good cost control, and we\u2019re able to capture the margins in the marketplace. We had a slight benefit in the second quarter because the Richmond turnaround was deferred. So it was a little bit less of an impact than what we had guided to on the first quarter call. And timing effects really weren\u2019t a driver right, timing is more of the absence of timing effects that you saw. In terms of these markets, they are volatile right now. I mean, we\u2019ve seen margins come off from where they were before. In the second quarter, we saw a demand response. On gasoline, probably around the mid-single digits across the U.S., a little bit higher on the West Coast, a little bit lower in the Gulf Coast. I didn\u2019t really see much on the diesel side. And Jet is really tied to the recovery of travel. So we will just see where the market takes us, whether it\u2019s West Coast or Gulf Coast, we\u2019re focused on safe, reliable operations, continuing to have good cost control and delivering products that our customers are demanding. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I have one on the upstream portfolio and then one on the financials. On the upstream, can you just talk about your other gas opportunities that you have available in the queue. Specifically, I am thinking about the Eastern Med. I know you\u2019re delineating some acreage there and it seems like there is a lot of gas available to exploit. And then also, I believe you have a Haynesville position. I am not sure if that\u2019s in the money or not and that\u2019s what\u2019s that you are looking at? And then I\u2019ll ask my follow-up after. Thanks.\nJay Johnson: Okay, thank you. We have a lot of gas opportunities, and we\u2019ve got a lot of infrastructure to build those opportunities on, which is really important because it gives us an advantage from a return standpoint. In the Eastern Med, which I\u2019ll add is one of the lowest carbon intensity areas from a Scope 1 and Scope 2. We\u2019re at 2 kilograms of carbon equivalent per barrel produced. We have, of course, supplied a lot of gas into the Israeli market and that opportunity continues to grow as coal is displaced. We also take that gas into Jordan for conversion to electric power. And now we\u2019re taking it into Egypt, work and supply, both domestic needs in Egypt, but also potentially access some of the hullage that exists in the LNG facilities that are already existing in Egypt. We\u2019re considering floating LNG as well. As you know, there are very benign conditions, Med Ocean conditions in the Mediterranean that lend themselves to floating LNG. So it represents a viable option for us. Developing additional gas capacity at Leviathan and Tamar is well within the scope of those projects and would allow us to access these additional marketing opportunities through the LNG and the flexibility that provides. We continue to have some upside potential in additional fields through EG. And then we\u2019ve got access, as you pointed out, in the United States. We are ramping up our drilling activity in the Haynesville, and we expect to see rigs there starting later this year. They will be working in that area. It was very profitable even at the low prices, it\u2019s profitable now. So again, our focus is going to be on discipline on continuing to drive for those efficiencies, but we really are excited to get Haynesville underway and add that to our portfolio in that part of the country. Thank you.\nJason Gabelman: Great, thanks. And my follow-up is just on the share count. I believe it went up again this quarter despite the buyback. And it\u2019s gone up since the buyback started. I think if you back out the shares issued for Noble, it\u2019s been flattish. So can you just discuss exactly what\u2019s going on there and your expectations for their share count moving forward with the higher buyback but also at a higher share price? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Yes. The share count is going down and will go down. What you see in the earnings press release is a weighted average during the course of the quarter, not necessarily the end of the quarter. So you\u2019ll see in our Q that the share count at the end of second quarter is, in fact, lower than the first quarter, which you\u2019d expect as we bought back 2.5 billion shares and issued 0.8. The first quarter, we had these very large issuances for our employees and retirees exercising stock options. And so we started the year with a lower share count, issued those for our employee retiree stock options, therefore, started second quarter at a higher rate and then worked our way down. So the math does work. It is going down. It\u2019s \u2013 you have to look at end of quarter to end of quarter. But what you see in terms of earnings per share, it\u2019s an average over the quarter, and it\u2019s kind of a quirk that second quarter average was higher than the first quarter, but just the nature of the pattern during the quarter. Share counts are going down. Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: Thank you, guys. My first question here is \u2013 I wanted to take expertise from Jay again. This was a heavy turnaround quarter for you. But even then, some of the things where you were turning around were very high-margin barrels for you, so whether it was TCO, Angola or Wheatstone. And help us understand, like in terms of opportunity cost, if this volume was somewhere in the lower margin business versus some of your higher-margin business because you\u2019re trying to say upstream results were good, but they could have been even better because some of the higher margin barrels were actually in a turnaround?\nJay Johnson: I appreciate the question. Manav, one of the things that\u2019s really important to us is that we operate safely and reliably. And so we look and we schedule our turnarounds and they are predominantly to ensure asset integrity and ongoing reliable performance. And when we schedule those, we don\u2019t like to shift those because of market conditions. And so we tend to want to execute those on time. What\u2019s important is that we execute them within the time frames that we expected so that our production is in accordance with our planning. And both Wheatstone and Angola LNG were done really, really well. I was proud of our teams, they went in, they did the turnaround. This means now in Australia, all five trains have been through the first round of turnarounds. And so that\u2019s an important milestone, an important accomplishment. This work that we do, while it may seem like we\u2019re giving up some opportunities in the near-term, it allows us to continue to drive higher and higher reliability, which means our overall production will be higher and our costs will be lower and our safety will be higher. And so that\u2019s really how we think about this.\nManav Gupta: Thank you. And I have a quick policy question. About 1.5 months ago, things got a little heated between the oil companies and the White House. But as we understand, when the actual executive meetings happen between you guys and all the others and the Secretary of Energy, those are pretty cordial and you guys are looking for solutions out there. Help us understand what happened in the meeting with Energy Secretary and how did those go?\nPierre Breber: Manav, we won\u2019t comment on the specifics of our engagements. I think you\u2019re right that we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s constructive and productive. I\u2019ll point out our U.S. oil and gas production in the first half of the year was up 7% versus last year. Our U.S. refined product sales up 10% versus last year. The administration wants energy supplies to increase, we\u2019re doing that. Our investment globally, up 80% first half of the year. If you look at the U.S., more than double when you include REG, so Chevron is growing energy supply, increasing investment and we are engaging constructively with Congress and this administration. Thanks, Manav.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one for me on Australia. I mean there is gas shortages in many geographies and Europe, in particular, but there has been some talk about or noise around that in Australia. I wanted to understand whether we should expect any export issues at Gorgon and Wheatstone? Are you in discussions with the government around proportion of gas going to domestic market versus what\u2019s being exported or anything like that? So, any color would be great. Thank you.\nJay Johnson: Thanks Biraj. The shortages that you have heard about in Australia are all on the East Coast, and there are no pipelines connecting the West Coast and the East Coast. So, actually, the only way that we could supply any gas to the East Coast of Australia is in the form of LNG. So, we are under long-term contract with customers throughout Asia. We also sell into the spot markets with those facilities. We have interest in Northwest Shelf as well as, of course, Wheatstone and Gorgon. The Western Australian market is well supplied. It\u2019s a part of our agreements for that supply. And so there really are no issues. I don\u2019t see any impact to our export capabilities in Australia.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay. Understood. And just a follow-up on the same topic. A couple of years ago, I think I had a conversation with Pierre around the potential for increasing nameplate capacity at Gorgon and Wheatstone over time. And as you go through the various debottlenecking exercises, are you able to provide an update on whether that\u2019s still in the works, where you are? And what kind of timeline that would be on, if that\u2019s possible?\nJay Johnson: Yes. We continue to focus on incremental capacity increases at both Gorgon and Wheatstone. And that can happen through expansion of debottlenecking where we actually expand the capacity of the facilities. But importantly, it also happens as we increase the reliability of facilities and their utilization is higher. If you just look at this year, we have supplied 87 cargoes. As I said, that\u2019s up 10% on production from last year even with the turnaround that we had. So, you can see the improvement happening there. We have seen capacity increases at both Wheatstone and Gordon, and I would expect those to continue as we move forward.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Hi. Good morning.\nPierre Breber: Good morning Sam.\nSam Margolin: I wanted to revisit the LNG topic and maybe specifically to the Permian. Because there is just a lot of resource in the Permian that\u2019s not commercial, and that\u2019s \u2013 that includes different zones of what you are already developing plus areas that are not on your development calendar in the near-term. And LNG didn\u2019t historically help with that because it\u2019s expensive, but obviously, things have changed now. And so I would just love your perspective on what happens to your Permian resource or your overall opportunity there or the duration of it in an environment where you can add some extra capital or even commit to a spread, but monetize gas for a double-digit price.\nJay Johnson: Look, I would characterize it what determines our pace of activity in the Permian is a balance on what we can accomplish efficiently. We have a factory model all the way from land acquisition. We do deals all the time to fill in the checkerboards and ensure an efficient development plan. As an example, just since 2017, we have executed over 260 transactions that have added 3,500 long laterals. That\u2019s allowed us to drive for this efficiency and the higher returns. Our activity levels really aren\u2019t determined by how much we can export from the United States. All these projects that we have would be economic at much lower prices. So, it\u2019s really not the price that\u2019s unlocking the Permian, it\u2019s developing the infrastructure for export from the basin into the markets that we supply, both domestic and international. So, it\u2019s all done in a coordinated fashion. We do it. So, we stay within the capability of the organization to execute efficiently and safely. And that\u2019s really what drives the Permian. So, it\u2019s nice to have access to these additional markets and the optionality they provide. We have an advantage in working closely with our midstream group who has great capability, both again for the domestic off-take and setting up potential for international export, but it\u2019s really not what I would view as the limiting factor on our pace. We determine that based on our overall balance of free cash flow, the returns and our resource and reserve replenishment.\nSam Margolin: Okay. And then, I mean maybe just to follow-up, like, are there any ancillary factors that might be a consideration like an opportunity to fit another CCUS project on a facility or what it might contribute to like a flaring mitigation effort or anything besides just, like you said, a price signal?\nJay Johnson: As Pierre said earlier, the Permian actually has very good carbon intensity on the Scope 1 and 2 basis. We are at 15 kilograms of CO2 across the basin. We are now benchmarking our facilities and achieving certification of platinum status on most facilities with Project Canary which then provides independent third-party certification of our methane emissions and the performance that we have been talking about. We are working with both our Chevron Technology Ventures, which is our venture capital arm and our New Energies segment on the carbon capture and sequestration. And carbon capture in particular, is critically important for not just us, but the world. And so we have three pilots going on at San Joaquin Valley operations to capture the CO2 that\u2019s coming off of our cogen units there. And then of course, we are gaining experience at Gorgon and Quest [ph] up in Canada, where we learn more and more about what it takes to effectively and efficiently sequester CO2 into storage. So, these are all going on. The beauty of having a portfolio like we do is we can put these pilot projects and we can put these demonstration projects wherever it makes the most sense, both from a regulatory, fiscal and return standpoint and develop these technologies that we are all going to need going forward.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Sam.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Irene Himona with Societe Generale.\nIrene Himona: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations on the strong quarter. I wanted to ask, first of all, about what you are seeing on the ground in terms of any signs of persistent demand destruction at retail, but also at industrial customer level, please?\nPierre Breber: Irene, I said it very quickly earlier, I mean we have seen, I would call it, demand response to higher prices that in the second quarter was about in the mid-single digits in the U.S. on gasoline. Again, a little higher on the West Coast, a little lower on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And I think we have seen some recovery since because prices have come off, so we will see where our third quarter ends up. On diesel, it\u2019s very hard to see, not price sensitive, it\u2019s tied to commercial industrial activity, maybe a little bit of a response at retail diesel. And then jet is largely tied to the recovery in air travel. I think people are wanting to get out and see people in places. Asia, where we also have retail is a little more variable because there has been still COVID restrictions and so it\u2019s hard to kind of see the data. I mean what\u2019s interesting is there is obviously concerns around the recession. In terms of tailwinds, we still have very low unemployment, and we have a consumer that wants to spend money to go out and do things they haven\u2019t been able to do for a couple of years. When prices were higher in the second quarter, they made some choices. And if you look at that demand response on gasoline, that\u2019s in line or even higher than some past recession. So, it\u2019s not clear. I guess what I would say is demand, I think will be much more recession resilient going forward just because we have seen a little bit of that response in the second quarter. And again, diesel will be tied to underlying commercial activity. And I think jet will really depend on if the airlines can get all the flights scheduled and have pilots and all the rest and some of the challenges that have been happening over there. So, that\u2019s a little bit of a sense of the demand. We saw a response second quarter, seeing some of it come back here early third quarter, and we will just see where it goes from here.\nIrene Himona: Thank you, Pierre. For my follow-up, and as you mentioned you are launching some new carbon capture projects. I wanted to go back to Australia and ask if you can possibly talk around the recent performance at the Gorgon carbon capture project. Is utilization improving? And is there any read through perhaps on the technical side from that project to the ones you are launching now? Thank you.\nJay Johnson: Thanks, Irene. At Gorgon, we have now stored successfully about 6.6 million tons of CO2 into that reservoir. The \u2013 ironically, the biggest issue we are having currently is just the ability to remove water at a sufficient rate from the storage reservoir to create the space for the CO2 to enter. We have already demonstrated the capacity and capability to inject full CO2 rates into that reservoir, but the water that we are producing has some solids in it and some other contaminants, ironically, oil and gas because it\u2019s an oil and gas basin. And we need the surface facilities that can just remove those before that water is injected into a third reservoir. These are not new or particularly high technology challenges at all. It\u2019s what we deal with in everyday life around the world. So, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s compounded a little bit because Gordon sequestration is in a Class A nature reserve, so it\u2019s a very cumbersome process to approve additional facilities and additional wells. But these problems are solvable. And they do not represent, in my view, any kind of a restriction on the viability of carbon sequestration as a means of storing CO2 for long periods. What I would expect is that and we said this before, as we learn, as we go through this, what it\u2019s teaching us is that there are uncertainty ranges on any reservoir, whether you are producing from it or injecting into it and having sufficient contingencies and mitigations, depending on where you find yourself in those uncertainty ranges when you actually put the facility into operation is important, and we will need to keep these in mind as we develop sequestration projects around the world. So, the science is good. The technology works. It\u2019s just the basic issues that we face on reservoirs around the world that we now need to overcome.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Hi guys. Good morning. And Jay may I add my congratulation and thank you for the help over the years. Really, I appreciate it.\nJay Johnson: Thanks Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Two questions. First, you touched on the inflation in different parts of your business. But can you give an over or given your footprint, can you give us an overall view that what is sure on expectation on the inflation for next year? I know it\u2019s still early for your budget, but are we talking about 10%, 15%? Some of your largest suppliers seems to suggest that everything is all used up in terms of manpower and equipment. , I don\u2019t know whether that you agree with that assessment. And if you can tell us that where you see along the supply chain, is the biggest maybe pass upon and where that you see the least inflationary pressure? So, that\u2019s the first question. The second question on Mexico and Brazil. You guys entered I think a couple of years ago and had some block over there. But I haven\u2019t heard you guys talk too much about those. So, where those rank within your portfolio today? And what is the next step in those? Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Paul. I will take the first, and then I will hand it to Jay on the second. On the onshore U.S., we have seen cost inflation this year in the single digits. We have been able to mitigate a part of that through good planning, smart procurement and good relationships with suppliers. And as Jay pointed out, we have been able to also get more efficient with our drilling and completion operations, which also partially offsets it. Outside of the U.S., we are seeing much more modest inflation, and we talked about our Gulf of Mexico offshore rigs, which are contracted at a time when the rig rates were lower. As we are looking towards 2023, we are doing that work right now. We are confident that we will be able to secure all the goods and services that were needed for our program. Again, our program will be a higher activity program next year, and that includes the Permian. And we will share estimates of what we are seeing in terms of COGS inflation when we disclosed our CapEx budget in December. We are just in the middle of that work right now, I feel very good that we will have all the goods and services that we need, and we are finalizing our plans. Jay?\nJay Johnson: Yes. Thanks. And Paul, in terms of Mexico and Brazil, we have not had exploration \u2013 significant discoveries there. We are turning our attention, I would say, towards Egypt, where we have a very nice exploration position. We are shooting seismic. These are in areas that have been unexplored before because they have been in restricted areas and now available to us as well as in Suriname. So, as we do an exploration, we are always going through and looking for the next opportunities, but I would say our focus primarily is shifting now towards Egypt and Suriname. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our last question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. Maybe first one on the biofuel side. Closed both the REGI and the Bunge deals within that business. Can you talk a little more about what you are seeing in those markets? And whether you can elaborate at all about the broad types of commercial opportunities that you see that you mentioned in your prepared remarks?\nPierre Breber: Thanks Ryan. We are really excited to welcome REG\u2019s people to Chevron and CJ Warner to our Board. She is already participated in our first Board meeting, is fantastic, has great knowledge of traditional and new energy businesses, and it\u2019s just a great add to our Board. As I have said, we had some sort of early wins. I won\u2019t get into the details of the commercial opportunities, but what we saw in the combination, the strength that REG has in terms of feedstock acquisition primarily of waste oils, and then combining that with our retail and marketing footprint. And just bringing two great teams together, we are seeing, as you would expect, one plus one is more than two. We have got our renewable fuels business headquartered in Ames, Iowa. And we are very excited about it. We closed in mid-June, just a comment on the accounting. There were no results in our second quarter results because we chose a convenience day of June 30th. So, all you will see and all you saw in our earnings release and you will see in the Q is just the purchase accounting starting in third quarter, then we will see REG in our results. REG had a good second quarter. Margins have been bouncing around, but the results are largely in line with expectations and Geismar continues on track. And same thing with Bunge, operating two crushers, very excited to be part of that, invested in CoverCres [ph] jointly, which is a crop that won\u2019t compete with food. So, lots of work in this space as we work to get our renewable fuels capability up to 100,000 barrels a day. Still working, still on track to convert a diesel hydrotreater at El Segundo to have renewable fuel capability and work across other parts of Chevron systems. So, the combination of REG, our Bunge joint venture and our own assets, along with our customer relationships, we are all putting that together to have what we think will be a very successful, viable renewable fuels business.\nRyan Todd: Thanks Pierre. Maybe the final one for Jay. Congrats on the retirement. I wanted to kind of a higher level question on upstream project development and technology. And there has been a pretty significant shift over the last 5 years to 10 years in the way that you have approached project development, more standardization, oftentimes smaller and more capital-efficient style projects. Ballymore is a great example of this. It\u2019s lowered the cost of supply a lot, especially in the deepwater. As you pass the baton and look forward kind of into the next 10 years, are there things that you can see on the horizon either strategically or technologies that may continue to drive, changes in project development and technology that may drive things forward even further, whether it\u2019s 20,000 kit in the deepwater sort of from flow line improvements and allow longer tiebacks. And what could this mean for the future of your resource development portfolio?\nJay Johnson: Thanks for the question, and it\u2019s pretty exciting. I mean the one bad thing about retirement is you don\u2019t get to be part of the next steps, and I am excited about them. I would start by just saying, I think we have accomplished a mindset shift in Chevron, and this is throughout our workforce, being very focused on returns, not chasing a production target, but continuing to run this as a business and thinking about the returns we can get. Scale is important, but it\u2019s an outcome of the opportunity set that we have and the investments and capital that we choose to invest. Getting more focused, the factory model has been really important to us. And ironically, the started where we drilled lots of wells in places like [indiscernible] and San Joaquin. We have now successfully transferred that into our unconventional plays in Permian, in the DJ, in Argentina. And now we are actually taking that factory model into places like the Gulf of Mexico, where we do what we call urban planning, and we try and have a steady progression of projects, and we are developing the capability for further and further reach. I mentioned earlier that Jack St. Malo is now putting into service multiphase pumps. And these multiphase pumps sit on the sea floor, but they allow us to reach 30 miles, 40 miles and even maybe 50 miles out from the host facility, which really gives us great capacity to make even smaller accumulation economic, and give us the returns we are looking for while extending the life of these major hubs. I think the Gulf of Mexico will continue to be an important proving ground for some of these technologies that can then be exported around the world. So, our focus on standardization, our focus on minimum viable facilities, our focus on capital efficiency over just scale and NPV, all these together are resulting in and aligning with our technology center so that we continue to develop the technologies that are giving us the returns that we are going to need going forward. And with the resource base that we have today, and the team of people that we have in our technology groups and in our businesses, I am really excited.\nPierre Breber: Hey Ryan, thanks for that question. We will miss Jay, but his legacy will live on, and you will see it in the performance at the upstream has been delivering and will continue to deliver.\nRoderick Green: Thanks Ryan. I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone\u2019s participation on today\u2019s call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Chevron\u2019s second quarter 2022 conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-29 13:54:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.\nRoderick Green: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website.  Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.  Now I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Wirth: All right. Thanks, Roderick. Before we turn to first quarter results, I'd like to recognize the people of Ukraine. Our hearts go out to those affected by this tragedy, and we hope for a prompt and enduring diplomatic resolution.  The last 2 years have been volatile and unpredictable, driven by the global pandemic and geopolitical conflict, creating strains on economies and markets around the world. Through it all, our objectives have been clear and consistent. And in the first quarter, we continued to make progress, delivering book returns in the mid-teens, investing to grow both our traditional and New Energy businesses and returning even more cash to shareholders while maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet.  Recent events remind us of the importance of energy. Looking forward, I know that Chevron is doing its part, raising this year's Permian production outlook and advancing 2 important renewable fuel transactions: our Bunge JV, which is expected to close shortly; and the Renewable Energy Group acquisition, which is expected to close around midyear.  While the future is uncertain, our actions are not. We're on a path to delivering higher returns and lower carbon and rewarding our stakeholders all along the way.  With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss our financials.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Mike. We reported first quarter earnings of $6.3 billion or $3.22 per share. Adjusted earnings were $6.5 billion or $3.36 per share. Included in the current quarter were pension settlement costs totaling $66 million and negative foreign currency effects exceeding $200 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation.  Adjusted ROCE was over 15% and our net debt ratio is below 11%. A third consecutive quarter with free cash flow over $6 billion, enabled us to return $4 billion to shareholders and further pay down debt. In addition, during the quarter, we received over $4 billion in cash, with about 3,000 current and former employees exercise stock options. This quarter's proceeds from option exercises were over 4x the historical annual average of around $1 billion per year.  About 2/3 of the vest adoptions at year-end 2021 were exercised during the first quarter, lowering the potential future rate of dilution from the outstanding balance. Over time, we expect our share buybacks to more than offset the first quarter dilutive effect.  Adjusted first quarter earnings were up $4.8 billion versus last quarter -- versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations while adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher margins, partially offset by negative timing effects. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were up more than $1.6 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher realizations and the absence of certain fourth quarter DD&A charges.  Liftings were lower in part due to lower production in the Gulf of Mexico. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily on timing effects. The All Other segment was down primarily on unfavorable tax items and higher corporate charges. The All Other segment results can vary between quarters, and our full year guidance is unchanged.  First quarter oil equivalent production decreased 2% year-on-year due to the expiration of Rokan in Indonesia, lower production in Thailand as we approach the end of the concession and lower entitlements due to higher prices. Permian growth in the absence of Winter Storm Uri, impacts partially offset and drove U.S. oil and gas production up over 10%.  Now looking ahead. In the second quarter, we expect lower production due to planned turnarounds at Wheatstone and Angola LNG, impacts from CPC pipeline and the expiration of the Area 1 concession in Thailand. At CPC, 2 of the 3 single port moorings are now back in service and TCO has returned to full operations. Downtime associated with the April repairs is estimated to be less than 15% of our second quarter turnaround and downtime guidance.  We anticipate a return of capital between $250 million and $350 million from Angola LNG in the second quarter. This cash is reported through cash from investing and not cash from operations. In the first quarter, Angola LNG returned over $500 million of capital. The differences between affiliate earnings and dividends are not ratable and TCO has not yet declared a dividend in 2022. With higher commodity prices, affiliate dividends are expected to be $1 billion higher than our previous guidance.  We've utilized our NOLs and other U.S. tax attributes and expect to make estimated U.S. federal and state income tax payments in the second quarter. These payments will flow through working capital accounts, just like our first quarter IRS refunded. In the second quarter, we expect to invest $600 million as we close the Bunge joint venture and to repurchase shares at the top of our guidance range.  With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick.\nRoderick Green: That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Katie, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Gresh: Mike, I want to start with one for you on Tengiz. There have been a number of events here in the quarter from the social unrest earlier in the quarter to the PC pipeline uncertainty and the moorings issues. So I recognize production seems to be back up and running to normal now. But I'm curious how you think about this in terms of the broader implications of what has been happening on the ground there and it's a very important asset for Chevron. So what are your latest thoughts?\nMichael Wirth: Well, Phil, it's an important asset, not just to our company but to the Republic of Kazakhstan and, frankly, to world energy markets in Europe, in particular. It's a significant supplier at a time when there are concerns about supply security that you're very familiar with. So we're focused on safe and reliable operations, as you would expect, protecting people in the environment and our assets, executing the major project, that's underway. And working with all the stakeholders that are involved in this. So that includes partners, it includes, obviously, the government of Kazakhstan and our customers.  So the risks that I think you're referring to are risks that are present in Kazakhstan and in varying degrees, in other parts of the world as well. And that's part of what we do is manage those risks on the ground each and every day. There are times when the environment feels a bit more benign, but you can't take your eyes off those risks because they can materialize at any point.  So to this point in time, we've been able to make good progress on the project. Some impact really from the weather-related downtime at the loading buoys and lower assist. But 2 of those are back in service and the third one is slated for repair, which would give us plenty of redundant capacity there. So we continue to stay very focused on every aspect of managing that our people on the ground are empowered to do what it takes and to be very responsive in real time. And I'm incredibly proud of the work that they've done in a very challenging environment.\nPhilip Gresh: Understood. I appreciate your thoughts. My second question would be for Pierre on cash flows or cash balances. The quarter did come in a bit lower than expected on cash flows, and I think you highlighted some timing factors. But you did get a bunch of cash from the stock vesting. So cash balances are up quite significantly. So I was wondering, I don't know if there's anything else to highlight on the moving pieces of the cash flow. But even at strip prices with your buybacks, it seems like cash balances will keep going up. So just what are your latest thoughts on managing the cash from here? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Phil. First, let me just talk about cash in the quarter. Cash in the quarter was very strong. As I pointed out, our dividends from affiliates are not ratable. And particularly from TCO, which historically has paid dividends in the fourth quarter, we increased our guidance on expected dividends, but they were light in the first quarter. So yes, that's timing. I also pointed out that Angola LNG returned $500 million of capital. That's essentially operating cash. That's a function of operating an LNG facility and selling it into the European gas markets at TTF prices.  However, adjusted to the accounting rules, it's flowing through cash from investing and not cash from ops. But for all intents and purposes, it is operating cash flow. And at some point in time in the future, it might revert back to that depending on the retained earnings in that affiliate. Another item I did not mention is that it's a typical item that happens in the first quarter. We pay out our long-term incentive compensation, which a portion of that is in the form of restricted stock and performance shares.  That is, again, happens annually, but with a higher stock price, that was a higher payment than in previous years. That does not flow through working capital. That comes out of a long-term liability account. And then as I mentioned, we expect to make estimated tax payments next quarter, but that will flow through working capital in many of analysts look at our cash flow ex working capital. But our IRS refund also went through working capital that we had guided to in the first quarter.  In terms of our cash balances, we're running a little bit high on our cash balance. That's why we refer to net debt, but we have a couple of cash items coming up. We expect to close REG around midyear. That's $3 billion. And we have an offering up right now to do a make whole call on about $3 billion of bonds. These are bonds that are economic to call back. And then on the buybacks, I mean, we just increased our buyback guidance at our Investor Day back in March to $5 billion to $10 billion We were at $5 billion rate here in the first quarter. We're doubling it now to the top of the range of $10 billion, and we'll just see where the environment goes from here.  We are not setting -- we are setting the buyback at a rate that we can maintain across the commodity cycle. We could have a higher buyback rate this quarter or next quarter, but the goal is not to maximize the buyback rate in any individual quarter. It's to set it at a level that we can maintain when the cycle turns. And therefore, we can rebalance our net debt ratio closer to our mid-cycle guidance.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: So the first one I wanted to ask is just on the Permian results and guidance increase. I was wondering if you could talk through in a bit more detail some of the drivers there. Are you adding activity? Is it better performance on the activity you had already budgeted for? Is it nonoperated? Just walk through some of the drivers there and how you're thinking about that.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Devin, we did have a strong first quarter and a couple of big things to bear in mind there. As we slowed things down in 2020 when demand contracted due to the pandemic, what happened is we ended up with an inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells that grew beyond what would be kind of a normal run rate for our rig fleet. And so we've been working through that and we're back down now to what you could think of as a more normal factory model. We always want to have docks out in front of the completion crews, but that had grown to a larger than normal rate.  So as we've caught that up, that's pretty efficient. It's the first place you turn as you see the cycle turn is completing those wells to get that production online, and we'll be moving into more of a factory model. So it will level out a little bit versus what might feel like a little bit of a surge. We also get some nonratable joint venture bookings that show up. And so both of those contributed to a very strong first quarter.  And of course, by the time you look at how that would roll through in the continued activity for the rest of this year, it's pretty clear that we'll end up higher than the initial guidance that we had put out. So -- but we haven't stepped up our program. We haven't stepped up a number of rigs. We haven't stepped up spending. It's all really a function of getting the machine running again. And then underneath that, there's ongoing efficiency improvements that we continue to see.\nDevin McDermott: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And my second question is on your global gas and LNG portfolio. And I was wondering if you could just give us an update on how you're looking at some of the medium and longer-term opportunities there given what's going on in markets. And specifically, I'm thinking about Eastern Med and that gas position. And then also whether or not integration into some type of LNG facility in the U.S. might make sense for some of your production growth there as well?\nMichael Wirth: Sure. So LNG is on everybody's mind these days. It's important to meeting Europe's needs. It's important to delivering a lower carbon energy system globally, and we see this strong market here in the near-term. Eastern Med is a wonderful asset. I was just over there 2 weeks ago. I visited the Leviathan platform, we spent a lot of time with our people in the business there. And they've recently completed a project to increase infrastructure access to regional markets and we're actually flowing more gas into Egypt as a result of that. We're looking at a number of other opportunities to further increased production because the resource there is quite prolific. And that includes further coal-to-gas switching in Israel for the regional supply into neighboring countries, potential power generation for power distribution through the region, floating LNG, potentially using oilage and other LNG facilities in the region, a number of different commercial options that are being evaluated and worked.  So more to come as those mature, but it's an area of high priority for us because the market demand for it. When you look at the U.S., clearly, we've got a lot of gas production here that largely prices at Henry Hub today. And there are these projects that are in the process for LNG export facilities. We've had discussions with a number of those developers, nothing to say more than we've had discussions at this point.  But that's part of our LNG portfolio that we've been very focused on the Pacific Basin historically. And as the Atlantic Basin markets now look a little bit different as we flow gas from our West African assets into the Atlantic Basin, it may make sense for us to have some U.S. supply as well. So we'll advise you as we advance anything there.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Mike, I just love your perspective on the oil macro. You always have a good read on it. It strikes us that inventories for product and oil are very tight right now. You've got jet fuel recovering over the summer. We'll see what happens in China. Shale has an inelastic supply response. So how does this ultimately resolve itself in the near term? Do you ultimately need to solve or demand destruction through crack or flat price of oil? Or is there something that we're missing?\nMichael Wirth: No, Neil. I mean you're putting your finger on all the levers. If you step back from it, supply always responds more slowly than demands does. And in normal times, which we have not been in for the last couple of years, both of them kind of gradually move in relative sympathy with one another. You've got storage out there that can buffer any near-term imbalances. I'm repeating what you all know. But in 2020, we saw a contraction unlike anything I've seen in my lifetime. And we had to really constrain activity. There was no sense producing more oil when the world needed a lot less.  And it wasn't clear at the time how long that might last and how deep it would be. And so the entire industry, every segment of the industry responded to that. And then as we've come out of the pandemic, demand growth has surged. And as you say, we haven't seen it all come back yet. Air travel, while it's -- domestic air travel in the U.S. is pretty strong, international air travel still has a ways to go to recover to pre-pandemic levels.  And then China and other parts of the world are still in various stages of lockdown at various points in time. And so we haven't seen a full recovery of demand there. So even with that, demand has now responded more quickly than supply can match it. And then you overlay a host of other issues, right? The independent E&Ps feeling more of an obligation to return cash to their shareholders. Some of the big integrated companies have reprioritized new energy versus traditional energy and have indicated they intend to shrink rather than grow their oil and gas production.  And then the NOCs going around the world, everybody has got a little bit of a different situation. So it's a market that is not stable. It's not an equilibrium. Right now, as you say, inventories are quite low. Demand is still strong, and economies to this point seem to be handling it. At some point, particularly if prices were to move higher, I do think it starts to be a bigger drag on the economy than what we've seen to this point.  But there's a lot of attention in this market and the supply response is coming. We're up 10% in the U.S. year-on-year. We're working on the big project in Kazakhstan, which will start up over the next couple of years. And others around the world have got things that they're doing as well. But it just comes in at a different pace than the demand has moved. And I think we're in a market that's tight right now, that has a lot of uncertainty and I think that is not likely to resolve itself in the near term, the uncertainty. Things like the SPR release in the near term can do a certain amount to call those markets. But over time, it's a cyclical business. There's a lot of resource out there that can be produced at prices lower than we see today.  And one of the lessons is history is just as the bad times don't last forever, neither do the times when prices are strong, and so we can't start to believe they'll always be like this. But I think in the relative short term here, the tensions that you referred to are likely to remain.\nNeil Mehta: It's a great perspective, Mike. Another big picture question is, if you think about 20 years ago at the beginning of the last super cycle, you had very similar, very large multiple arbitrages between the super majors and even large independents and some of the majors. And one could look at your multiple on consensus and say you trade a premium relative to a lot of the global majors. Do you think there's value in mega M&A in the space? And do you see yourself as a logical consolidator, given that M&A is such a core competency and it worked out incredibly well for you 20 years ago with Texaco?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. We're always looking at these things, Neil. I think history would suggest that deals done in an upcycle or near the top of the cycle don't necessarily look as well in hindsight as deals that were done in a different part of the cycle. 20 years ago, when there was a number of transactions that you referred to, we were coming out of oil prices in the teens or the '20s. And so consolidation made sense.  There were a lot of synergies to be harvested as you put some of these companies together. I think the entire industry is more efficient today than it was then certainly large companies, which you refer to kind of large-scale M&A. And so I think the synergy opportunities, while no doubt there would be some, they may not be of the same magnitude that they were 20 years ago. We've all used technology and other things to improve the efficiency of our operations.  So I never say never, but I don't know that just because we're trading at a relatively strong multiple right now that, that should lead you to believe that it means we're more likely to do something that our track record of discipline would suggest.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Our first question, maybe we just hit back on cash returns. The buyback for 2Q annualized again, is at the top of your range. And Pierre, I think you reiterated on Phil's question that buybacks are intended to be through the cycle. Can you just maybe provide a little bit of commentary on how you're viewing the buyback in relation to mid-cycle cash flow?\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Jeanine. The buyback rate of $10 billion is a company record, and previous highest buyback rate was back in 2008. And as you say, we want to maintain it across the commodity cycle. So we're very in tune with what our mid-cycle cash flow capabilities are. We showed at our Investor Day low case of $50 Brent and show that we can maintain the buyback for multiple years, even though $50 is notionally right around the breakeven for covering both our dividend and our capital. And then, of course, we showed the high case of $75 where buybacks were, in fact, higher than the current $10 billion guidance.  And we could buy back at that point in time, it was more than 25% of the company, it's a little bit less based on the current stock price. So that's exactly how we're thinking about it. To Neil's question and the macro, it was just 2 years ago today on this earnings call, that Chevron was the only company to show a 2-year stress test at $30 Brent. And that was a real stress test. And we showed that we could maintain the dividend, invest in the business for long-term value. We certainly reduced some short-cycle capital.  And yes, we would take on some debt, but we'd have a debt ratio that would still be very manageable. And in fact, would be not far from where many of our competitors were entering the COVID crisis. So as Mike says, we're mindful of the cycles that are in our business, we have to plan and manage for them. Again, we could have -- we can afford a much bigger buyback program next quarter. We don't -- you know, Jeanine, that a net debt ratio under 11% is not what we're targeting. I mean that's just how the math works.  We grew our dividend 6% earlier this year. Our dividend is up nearly 20% since COVID, while many in the industry cut their dividends during the last couple of years. Our investment -- organic investment is up more than 30% versus last year. When you include our announced acquisitions, total investment is up 50%. So clearly, we're investing, as Mike has said, to grow both our traditional new energy businesses.  And we paid down debt, and we've been increasing our buyback as we've seen the strength of this upcycle and the likely duration of it increase, but the cycle will turn and we'll continue to do buybacks. And so we want to set the buyback at a rate that we can manage it, not only at our mid-cycle cash flow generation capability, but even when it goes below that. Again, we're going to -- there's going to be a time where we're going to be buying back shares, and we'll be doing it on the balance sheet because we want to relever back closer to that 20% to 25% net debt ratio range that I've talked about.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Great. Very helpful. Maybe if we just can move back to the assets on the Permian. Permian for you guys is firing on all cylinders, clearly have a big asset there with huge long-term value. One of the things that has been talked about a bunch recently is just FT on the gas side and how you kind of see that evolving. Just wondering how Chevron is looking at that for your long-term plans.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Jeanine, we -- I'm glad you talked about long-term plans because we've had a long-term Permian plan. And interestingly, notwithstanding one of the most volatile 2-year periods we've seen, our production profile doesn't look that different than it did just a couple of years ago in terms of where we're headed. And of course, that drives everything from contracting for rigs and completion services to takeaway capacity for oil and gas liquids and gas. We've got sufficient takeaway capacity for our production through the middle of this decade.  And as we look forward, we're working on what it takes beyond that period of time. So we don't flare in the Permian. And so we've got to be sure we've got gas takeaway or we're not going to produce oil. And so it's a high priority for our midstream team. But we don't see pinch points anytime soon, and we continue to be a very attractive shipper for the people that we do business with because we're predictable. We've got a strong track record of continuing to deliver the growth that we have indicated. We got a strong balance sheet and all those things mean that people like to do business with us. So we feel pretty good about that for the next few years.\nOperator: We'll take our question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Two questions, please. First on inflation. Pierre, just curious, I mean for your CapEx for the next, say, 2 or 3 years, do you have a percentage you can share? What percent of your CapEx is in pretty much fixed price contracts, so don't subject much to inflation and what percent is really quite vulnerable to inflation? And also when we're looking at your CapEx for this year, the Bunge JV $600 million investment, is that included in your original budget or that this will be in addition to your original budget? That's the first question.  The second question maybe is for Mike, that with the much sharply higher commodity prices, when you have discussion and negotiation with the NOC, the host government, is there a change in the attitude on that it become more difficult for you to get better terms? Or that this is happening too quick and so you haven't really seen any change in the way how you conduct the discussion with your counterpart in the national companies or the host government?\nPierre Breber: I'll start...\nMichael Wirth: Pierre, do you want to start on -- yes, go ahead.\nPierre Breber: Yes, I'll start on the first question. There are several parts to it. So first, the Bunge joint venture, anything that is an acquisition inorganic is not included in our $15.3 billion budget that we shared back in December. So I think we cited that, in fact, in that press release that Bunge would be in addition. And then the other potential inorganic, there was a little bit of inorganic in the first quarter that included an investment in Carbon Clean, a technology company. REG also will not be included.  You won't see REG though, even in our total capital, our total C&E because it's a company acquisition. Let me just talk about cost inflation a little bit. We are seeing more cost pressure in the Permian. It's manageable. But if we go outside the U.S. seeing hardly any or much more modest increases, and none of that is changing our $15.3 billion CapEx budget that we've talked about. I'll remind everyone that the Permian is 20% of our capital budget. So it gets a lot of attention.  But again, 80% of it is not -- or outside the U.S. is not seeing much cost pressure at all. In the Permian, as Mike said, we plan our business. So we have all the equipment and services to execute our plan. And we've seen a little bit more than we had budgeted, but we can offset some of that with efficiencies in the Permian and with reductions elsewhere in the portfolio. Our focus is turning to 2023 and securing all the equipment and services that we'll need to execute that plan. But we'll share the details as we update our annual budget, which we do every December.  In general, Paul, you can think that we contract 30% to 40% of our total supplies each year. So that every 2 to 3 years on a rotational basis, it can vary, it depends by location. But we don't -- notionally, we are going to be exposed to some of these higher prices as we move into future years. Again, we've been able to manage this year very well depending on -- due to how we contracted previously.  Our $15 billion to $17 billion capital guidance, which goes on for 5 years, kind of assumes mid-cycle conditions. So it has the ability to absorb some of these cost increases that are transient. And so we'll execute within that. We have Tengiz coming off, which will open up more room in that capital guidance. And again, we'll share all the details when we release our capital budget in December.  But the bottom line is we're seeing modest increase. As we said, overall, our capital budget had just a few low single digits of COGS inflation for this year, a little bit more than that in the Permian. It's all very manageable, and we're working hard to secure contracts for future years activity. Mike?\nMichael Wirth: Okay. Paul, your second question was on discussions with host governments on concessions and how that may be affected by the price environment. I would tell you that right now, we're pretty early into this price upcycle. And I'm not sure that I can say we've seen a lot of change as people are really adjusting to the environment we're in. But on the broader issue of concession extensions, look, we've got to find these opportunities and negotiations that create value for the company and for the host country. And so you really have to look at it through the lens of both.  We had long histories in both Indonesia and Thailand. I would have liked to extend those concessions that are rolling off last year and this year, but we couldn't find an outcome that satisfied the host governments expectations and that would compete for capital within our portfolio, which has got a lot of alternatives. The flip side of that is Angola, where we last year extended our Block 0 concession from 2030 out to 2050.  And that's a partnership that started more than 60 years ago. And there was a lot of common ground there on contributing to reliable and cleaner supply for Angola, reducing greenhouse gas emissions there and finding a way to do that on terms that will attract capital within our portfolio.  So we approach each one of these things, looking for value for our shareholders and to provide a proposition for other stakeholders that they find acceptable. Sometimes we can achieve that. Other times, we can't. So more to follow probably in terms of -- if this turns out to be a long upcycle, how that may change those dynamics. But I think the fundamental approach that we take is unlikely to change.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes. If we could maybe talk a little bit about some of the bigger projects, thinking about your answer earlier, Mike, on some of the macro items and under investment. I know you have some things in the Gulf of Mexico. You've obviously got an extensive LNG footprint globally. How do you think over the next couple of years blending in your kind of known deepwater projects and then the possibility of doing something again on the LNG front?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. So we've got a nice set of projects under development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Jack/St. Malo has a multiphase pumping project that will start up this year. Next year, we'll hit the first waterflood injection on St. Malo and some additional development drilling there. Big Foot, which is on production right now. We've got ongoing development drilling and water injection soon to follow. Mad Dog 2 is slated for first oil this year.  We've got Anchor, which is expected to have first oil in 2024. Whale also expecting to have first oil in 2024. We just sanctioned Ballymore, which we'll have first oil in 2025. So there are -- there's a queue of these things that is rolling through. And what's a little bit different than in the past is they're not all in the same phase of development at the same time. So I gave you those kind of in order of when they come on production. But we don't have them just sitting on top of each other.  So a lot of the lessons of maybe the last upcycle, where don't take on more than you or your suppliers and contractors have the capacity to do well in any given period of time, and we're really trying to apply that here. So it doesn't get as much attention or interest as we get from the Permian these days or Kazakhstan, but a really important part of our portfolio, really nice projects and very low carbon energy for the world.  I mean, this is some of the lowest carbon intensity stuff in our portfolio. Our portfolio averages about 28 kilograms of CO2 per BOE. Our Gulf of Mexico averages 6. So it's not only economic, it's low carbon. It's something that I think that our country is blessed with and should continue to advance leasing in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.  On the other question, LNG. I addressed earlier a little bit of the -- we got a number of options in the Eastern Mediterranean. We're talking to some people here in the U.S. You may have seen media reports that we have been talking to people in the Middle East about expansion projects there. So we're evaluating a number of different opportunities. We'd like to grow our LNG position. The world needs it. But similar to my response to Paul, it's got to compete for capital.  In our portfolio, Pierre mentioned, we're going to stay disciplined on capital. We've given you a range. We've stuck within that range. Ever since we started putting that out here, and that would be the intent. So just because something looks good through the lens of growth and commodity exposure is also got to compete for capital in a disciplined budget. And so we'll just see which of those, ultimately, if any, kind of past that screen.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Maybe a follow-up on LNG. I mean the last couple of quarters have been impacted by various LNG volumes offline. I know you've leased on an LNG statement in the second quarter. Any kind of clarity you can give in terms of how much volume impact that might have? And beyond that, can you give an update on the other potential volume disruptions across your LNG operations?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. So in the first quarter, we had a little bit at Gorgon from some of the things that we had talked about earlier. So some discovery work that was proactive, not related to an incident, but it was asset integrity work across all 3 trains. A little bit of that came into the first quarter of this year. Wheatstone has a turnaround underway right now of one of the 2 trains and also the offshore platform and some common facilities, which that requires both trains to come down when you take the offshore and common facilities down.  The good news is that part of the turnover is behind us right now. And we're in the process of resuming production at one of the 2 trains there at Wheatstone and should have first LNG any day now. And actually, the second trend will be early May. So we're nearly through that turnaround. Then we also have a turnaround in -- at Angola LNG. And so that will be in the second quarter, late in the second quarter and that's really what we've got planned for this year. Second quarter takes all the planned turnaround activity essentially or the majority of it.\nRyan Todd: Okay. And then maybe a second question on refining. Can you talk about some of the -- I guess, as you think about the -- some of the headwinds that were maybe felt during the first quarter and relative to headline margins, whether it's lag on timing effects or secondary products or things like that. Can you about how some of those trends may reverse or shift into the second quarter looking forward? And how you think about the ability to kind of capture some of that back as we look in through second quarter and third quarter?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. I'll take a pass, but Pierre might want to add something. Look, we see this in our downstream business. We're a little bit differently positioned than some of our peers in that we've got pretty heavy U.S. West Coast exposure and heavy Asia exposure, but then we're pretty light in the Middle East or Europe and some of the other basins. So our portfolio is a little concentrated more so than others. And so -- we're subject to the dynamics in those markets. China has been in a lot of kind of ongoing lockdowns.  California, frankly, has had a little more aggressive COVID policy longer than some other parts of the world. And so demand has reflected that to a certain degree. And then in a rising crude market, we have 2 effects that tend to roll through our downstream. One is just the way our inventory is valued and so in a rising market, we tend to see inventory -- negative inventory effects due to the LIFO accounting that we use. And we also tend to see -- we're long physical and short paper as we try not to take price exposure.  But that paper marks to market until the physical closes. And so in a rising market, your papers marking negative, the physical obviously, is gaining. And so you see that paper and then the physical deliveries you close out the paper and you match those up. So in a rising market, those 2 effects tend to cause negatives. I think in the second quarter of this year, we'll probably see a lot of that reverse.\nOperator: We'll go next to Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: My first question is a quick clarification. You did indicate there was a storm at CPC. I think it came somewhere late March, but the impact would probably be felt more in 2Q. So help us understand how long the facilities were down? And how should we model the impact on production because of this particular storm?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. So -- yes, you want to handle that, Pierre? Go ahead.\nPierre Breber: Yes. That's in our guidance, Manav, that we provided in -- for the second quarter production impacts from planned turnarounds and downtime. And again, the CPC TCO impact is about 15% or less than 15% of that total.\nManav Gupta: Okay. And then the second thing is...\nMichael Wirth: And you're right, Manav. It was late March when it came up. So the effect is really in the month of April.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. At your energy transition day, you had provided certain targets for growing your renewable fuel franchise, and REG gets you a very long way when it comes to renewable diesel. But another area you were generally bullish on was sustainable aviation fuel. You had indicated that long term, you believe this is a big growth market. So can you help us understand, since then and going forward, how does Chevron plan to build on its sustainable aviation fuel business?\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Manav. We -- obviously, aviation demand is going to grow as we go forward. And finding a solution, it's one of the hardest to decarbonize segments of the economy because you need to have high energy density for aviation fuels or planes can't carry much in terms of their cargo. So it's an area of focus. In a traditional refinery, the distillate portion of the barrel, you can move molecules from diesel to kerosene or jet fuel. And the renewable diesel investments that we're making, there's a certain flexibility that you have there as well.  And so we will have the ability to produce. In fact, we've already produced some sustainable aviation fuel at El Segundo. And we'll see more of that coming through some of our renewable diesel facilities. We have also get negotiations underway with some other companies that have different technologies that wouldn't necessarily be the same as what we would do in a refinery. And so we're looking at alternate pathways, feedstock partnerships and pathways.  This is all going to take time to come together. Quality control is really important in aviation fuels, reliability of supply is really important. And as we introduce new feedstocks, new technology pathways, you have to be really diligent in ensuring that the fuel that you ultimately produce and sell is going to perform in the engines that it's going to be consumed into.  The last thing I'll say is none of this stuff is inexpensive. And sustainable aviation fuel today is not competitive with traditional aviation fuel from a cost standpoint. There has been some talk in Washington about various policy incentives that could be put into place to encourage more sustainable aviation fuel. There's a letter that was published by a whole host of people, airlines and others just in the last week or so calling for action. And I think to see this scale, we got to keep working on technology in feedstocks but it's likely that some sort of policy incentives will be part of the equation in order to see more capital drawn into sustainable aviation fuel.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Mike, I know you've plugged to death, I guess, the questions around CPC, Kazakhstan and so on. I wonder if I could just ask a slightly different question around what's happening to realizations, insurance rates, whether that could be a durable discount on the value of the barrel coming out of Tengiz and over what time line. So I don't know if you can offer any color there, but obviously, it's something we noticed going on in the market.\nMichael Wirth: Sure. So pre invasion, CPC discounts were maybe $1 or so to dated Brent. Post invasion, the trading range has kind of been $4 to $10 net prices at a pricing point called Augusta, which includes insurance and freight. So yes, there's been a move. It's, call it, $7 or $8 today, probably. Now absolute price obviously has moved up a lot more than that. But there's a little bit that you could argue as being left on the table. I think a lot of it, Doug, depends on how things are resolved in Ukraine and what the longer-term posture is relative to sanctions, the perceived risk of lifting at Novvi resis and how that translates into demand from customers and the expectations from shipowners and whether it's freight rates, insurance, et cetera, are people willing to send ships back in there the way they historically have or not.  So it's a hypothetical. I think that I can't really speculate on how that settles out. But I think it's a function of how this whole situation is resolved and what kind of risks people perceive on the other side of the conflict resolution.\nDoug Leggate: I know it's a tough one to ask in the relatively early stages of this whole thing. So thanks, Mike, for having a go. I guess my follow-up, and I think it might have been Neil mentioned it earlier, but your credentials on M&A are obviously probably the best in the industry now, Mike, and you've led that. So -- and well earned. But your balance sheet is in to a point as you thought it's kind of almost back to 2013, '14 levels, if you take -- project out a year or so. And there's strategic opportunities as this whole thing evolves, particularly perhaps in U.S. gas, LNG and so on.  So I wonder if I could ask the M&A question a little differently as well, which is when you look at your business today and how you've invested and how you've transitioned through Noble and so on, is there any way you would identify, for one of a better expression, a strategic want or a strategic hole that you would like to fill? And what would that look like?\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Doug, I appreciate the comments about our M&A track record and our financial strength. Those are 2 things that we've worked hard to establish. I'll tell you, we like our portfolio. We've provided, again, I think in this year's Investor Day, a 10-year outlook that says how much resource have we captured and could conceivably flow into production, not that,, that's a production to forecast, but it's really a look at resource depth.  We've talked a little bit today about gas. We're a little oilier than most. And so over time, can we increase some of our gas exposure would be one question. We like petrochemicals. We like CPChem a lot. We've got a big chemicals business embedded in Korea, in Genus Caltex. The growth prospects in the petrochemicals business continue to look attractive. And then we've been active in new energies. And so the renewable fuels business that we talked about, some other things that we're looking at in that space as well.  And so look, we're trying to leverage our strengths to deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. And I think that drives the way we think about our portfolio today and tomorrow. And a number of things I mentioned there, right, are lower carbon contributions to economic growth and prosperity. So and -- that would be how we think about it. But I don't want to leave the impression that we're off to the races to do anything tomorrow because we like our portfolio as it sits today and don't feel like there's a hole that has to be filled in the short term. So we really can take a long-term look. We can be patient. We can be selective if we decide to do anything.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: First, I just wanted to clarify on the LNG maintenance. What is the cadence of maintenance across your assets going forward in future years? You've obviously had a period of very concentrated maintenance events. Is it 1 train a year? Or how do we think about that on a normalized basis? And then my follow-up is, just given the changing energy dynamics, I wonder if your discussions with governments, both domestically and abroad, if the discussions and the sentiment has changed at all in terms of the ability to invest in places. And if that's in any way starting to reshape the way you look at your investment opportunities?\nMichael Wirth: Okay. LNG turnarounds were typically at a 4-year turnaround cycle. So what that means is that Gorgon with 3 trains, you'll have 3 out of the 4 years, you'll have 1 turnaround. At Wheatstone with 2 trains, 2 out of every 4 years, you'll see a turnaround. And at Angola LNG, where we've got a single train, 1 out of every 4 years, you'll see a turnaround. On government discussions, it's just early, Jason, to say. I don't think anybody's really fully adapted or no one knows what the environment is likely to look like a year from now, 2 years from now, 5 years from now. So I think that's one that is a work in progress.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: The first one is just thinking about the capital framework again. And through the various presentations in recent years, the management team has been very consistent in talking about improving book returns. I think, Pierre, you've been quite emphatic around stating that the market doesn't reward higher capital spending, given, I guess, the industry's track record. I understand the CapEx budget in the range was only put out there a short while ago, but obviously, a lot has changed in recent months.  So the market clearly wants more energy. You are generating record amounts of cash, the buybacks are already at the top end of the range, shares are close to all-time highs. Do you think the market is sending signals yet that would support a capital budget increase beyond what you're doing in the Permian maybe through more exploration or otherwise? That's my first question. And the second question is on TCO and the growth projects there. Has anything that's happened in the last couple of months impacted your thinking around the time line to deliver those growth projects going forward?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. I'll -- Biraj, I'll take the second one, and then Pierre has been spending a lot of time with investors, and I'm going to let him talk to you about whether the market is signaling we ought to change our capital spend. On TCO, we just had a pretty extensive update on the project here. Week before last, we made good progress through the winter. We're close to having our annual cost and schedule update done. But the high-level message on that is we look pretty good on budget still.  We look good on the schedule for the future growth project, which is slated up -- slated to start up in the first half of '24. A little bit of pressure on WPMP, which I believe our last update on that was second half '23, late '23. So cost and schedule despite the challenges of COVID and the other kind of regional uncertainties, still holding well. The project team there is doing an excellent job.  So I think Jay will be on the second quarter call and can give you a more complete run down on things. We will have all these costs and schedule reviews completed, but nothing there that signals a significant change. Pierre, maybe you can talk about signals from the market on capital?\nPierre Breber: We don't intend to change our capital guidance. The objective is to sustain and grow the enterprise at the lowest capital level. We're much more capital-efficient than we were just a few years ago, let alone a decade ago. We showed and Mike just referred to, that we can sustain and grow our traditional energy business at very reasonable rates and rates that we don't need to grow faster, and we don't get paid for that. There's no time in the -- our history where the market has valued growth.  I mean that's why we emphasize return on capital employed because we are income-oriented, dividend-paying returns type of investment. And then, of course, we're growing new energies, and we have 2 big transactions are expected to close soon and more on the way. So if we're able to sustain and grow this enterprise, traditional energy at rates that are in line with industry growth rates, new energy faster. And we can do that at lower -- less capital, that leaves more cash flow for shareholders.  And so what you're seeing, and back to Jeanine's question and other questions, we generate -- at whatever oil price you assume, we generate more free cash flow than we ever have in the past. And that means we're able to grow the dividend at very competitive rates and have this buyback that we can maintain across the cycle. So we are very sensitive to doing our part. And as we said, we're growing energy supply in the U.S., in the Permian and other locations.  At the same time, the objective for a capital-intensive commodity business is to do it in the most capital-efficient way. The more capital efficient we are, the more capital gets returned to shareholders.\nRoderick Green: Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Chevron's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}], "2024": [{"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 4, "year": 2023, "date": "2024-02-02 13:46:08", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead.\nJake Spiering: Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide two. Now, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMike Wirth: Thanks, Jake, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Chevron delivered another year of solid results in 2023. During a time of geopolitical turmoil and economic uncertainty, our objective remained unchanged; safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. Our clear and consistent approach resulted in an adjusted ROCE of 14% and enabled a record of $26 billion in cash return to shareholders, while growing production to accompany a record. We also successfully integrated PDC Energy and announced the Hess acquisition. We're now focused on the FTC's second request and expect to file the draft S4 later this quarter with closing anticipated around the middle of the year and we continue to take action in lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and growing lower carbon businesses, advancing foundational projects in both hydrogen and carbon capture. Over the past five-year commodity cycle, with prices high, low and everywhere in between, Chevron led the peer group in what we believe are the most important measures that create value. We were the most capital efficient while managing unit costs well below inflation and many peers. Capital and cost discipline always matter in a commodity business. Combining this discipline with our focused portfolio of advantage assets, Chevron was able to lead the peer group in returning cash to shareholders. Our five-year dividend growth rate was greater than the S&P 500 and more than double our nearest peer. Surplus cash was returned to our shareholders in each of the past five years through share buybacks. Our track record has proven and we intend to continue growing value for our shareholders in any environment. In the Permian, we delivered on our full-year production guidance. Instead, a quarterly record of 867,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, while building our DUC inventory in the fourth quarter. Looking to the year ahead, our program is back-end loaded as we plan to continue to build our DUC inventory before adding an additional completion crew in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect production in the first half of the year to be down from the fourth quarter by about 2% to 4% before climbing toward a 2024 exit rate around 900,000 barrels per day. Chevron is a clear leader in Permian financial returns in the Permian with our unique royalty advantage and strong execution across a diverse portfolio. We have strong momentum and expect to achieve one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025. At TCO, we\u2019re making progress towards the first phase of WPMP FGP start-up. The slide shows how the project fits within the overall field and facilities. The field, currently flowing at high pressure, continues to keep the existing plants full. In fact 2023 net production was the highest since 2020. We\u2019ve completed a lot of project scope that is already operational. TCO is producing from the new wells. The upgraded and new utilities, gathering system, control center and power distribution system are all currently in operation. For WPMP, we\u2019re focused on starting up major equipment \u2013 including gas turbine generators, pumps and compressors. We expect to hand over to operations the first pressure boost compressor in March for final dynamic commissioning. Once we have PBF compression online, WPMP start-up is expected to begin in the second quarter when the first metering station is converted to low pressure, which will enable increased flow rates. Low pressure production streams going back to existing process units will be driven by the pressure boost compression. At the same time, production from metering stations not yet converted will continue to flow in the high-pressure system. We expect metering station conversions through the remainder of the year as additional pressure boost compressors start up, keeping the existing plants full around planned KTL and SGI turnarounds For FGP, we\u2019re focused on starting up additional gas turbine generators and compressors along with multiple processing units. The sour gas injection facilities have already been handed over to operations for final commissioning. FGP start-up is expected in the first half of next year when incremental production enabled by field conversion to low pressure will be processed in the new 3GP facility. Since last quarter, two boilers came online and two gas turbine generators have delivered power. We\u2019ve seen improvement in work scope delivery and have been working through additional discovery items. We\u2019ll continue to update you on progress and remain focused on key milestones to deliver a safe and reliable start-up. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pierre to discuss the financials.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Mike. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $2.3 billion, or $1.22 per share. Adjusted earnings were $6.5 billion, or $3.45 per share. Included in the quarter were $3.7 billion in charges pre-announced in January. Foreign currency charges were almost $480 million. Our 2023 CapEx included $650 million of inorganic acquisitions and around $450 million invested in legacy PDC assets post-closing. Excluding these items, CapEx was about 5% above budget after three consecutive years below. Share repurchases matched the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, ending the year with a net debt ratio comfortably in the single digits. Turning to the quarter, adjusted earnings were higher than last quarter by roughly $730 million. Adjusted upstream earnings improved due to higher liftings, in line with record quarterly production, and favorable timing effects. Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased on lower refining margins, partially offset by a favorable swing in timing effects. All Other benefited from lower corporate taxes and employee costs. For the full year, adjusted earnings decreased nearly $12 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted Upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower prices. Adjusted Downstream earnings were lower largely due to declining refining margins. Other segment earnings improved on lower employee costs and higher interest income. Solid financial performance enabled Chevron to deliver, again, on all four of its financial priorities. We announced an 8% increase in our dividend, reflecting our confidence in expected future free cash flow growth. We maintained capital discipline in both traditional and new energies. We reduced debt by over $4 billion, including all debt assumed in the PDC acquisition and we repurchased about 5% of our shares outstanding. Last year, we produced more oil and gas than any other year in the company\u2019s history, including a record number of LNG cargoes out of Australia. We expect 2024 production to be higher again, by 4% to 7%. Our plans include production growth in the DJ Basin, with a full year of legacy PDC operations and continued organic growth in the Permian. Our guidance this year includes an estimated impact from asset sales as we further high-grade our portfolio. Looking ahead, our first quarter downtime estimate includes around 20 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day associated with January\u2019s cold weather in North America. Earnings estimates from refinery turnarounds are mostly driven by Pascagoula. Share repurchases in the quarter will continue to be restricted under SEC regulations. Depending on commodity prices and margins, affiliate dividends are estimated around $4 billion, roughly flat with last year. We do not expect significant affiliate dividends in the first quarter. The difference between affiliate earnings and dividends is expected to decrease in the second half of the year after TCO\u2019s start-up of WPMP. Our CapEx guidance range is unchanged from the December budget announcement. In prior years, our CapEx rate in the first half of the year was about 20% lower than the second half. Our price sensitivities have increased at higher production levels. About 20% of the Brent sensitivity relates to oil-linked LNG sales and less than 10% relates to North America natural gas liquids. Back to you, Mike.\nMike Wirth: In closing, our priorities are clear: Safely execute with excellence, maintain capital and cost discipline; and return cash to shareholders. We\u2019re excited about the pending Hess acquisition which will further strengthen Chevron. I also want to personally thank Pierre for his invaluable contributions over his 35-year career with the company. He\u2019s been an exceptional strategic partner to me and an outstanding leader, helping guide Chevron to create significant value for shareholders. I wish him all the best in his retirement. I\u2019ll now hand it off to Jake.\nJake Spiering: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question. We will do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, thanks for taking my question and firstly, Pierre, congrats on a great career and all the best for retirement and thanks for all the help over recent years. I feel compelled to ask you a question on buybacks because it's your last time, but I'll try and resist. So the question's on the Permian. You had a very strong production number in Q4, quite an inflection from what we've seen in the last few quarters and I was interested in particular the comment on that volume growth alongside building the DUC inventory. So presumably the non-op side was a nice contribution in Q4. Could you just give some clarity on the bridge sort of 3Q to 4Q because the market has been concerned about you hitting the number of the lease for this year most recently. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Sure. So, in the third quarter, non-op was a little light, but in the fourth quarter, it came back. It didn't end the year. Non-op and royalty are right where we guided to from the beginning of the year. So, through a year, the quarterly ups and downs on some of these things, can create some questions, but it came in right as we guided to it in the mid-teens. The story on the fourth quarter was really strong execution. We had more POPs because we had faster drilling and faster cycle time on completions. We had a shorter cycle time from frack to POP. So all of those increased and as you noted, we did continue to build our DUC inventory because drilling performance was so strong. A couple other things, POPs in the fourth quarter were weighted towards New Mexico. We had guided towards activity that would lead to more POPs in New Mexico in the second half of the year. Those wells are more productive than kind of on average than the rest of the portfolio. So that flows through. And then the final thing that I would point to is we had higher reliability. You'll recall in the third quarter, we talked a little bit about some midstream constraints and other things that weren't related to completions or POPs or anything else, but they were constraints on flow. We had fewer frack hits. We had fewer scheduled delays, weather downtime, and midstream issues in the quarter. So all of that contributed to the strong performance there in the fourth quarter and we ended the year right on our guidance.\nOperator: We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah, thank you so much, Pierre. You're going out in style, and thanks for all the great insights and wisdom over the years.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Neil. My question's on Slide six, the TCO update. It sounds like the schedule and the cost guidance that was provided in November is still on track, but for us non-engineers, maybe, Mike, you can kind of walk us through the schematic and help us understand what of these boxes are the critical path issues that we should be focused on.\nMike Wirth: Yeah. So, you're right, Neil. The schedule and cost guidance is unchanged. I apologize for a more complex slide than we usually put out in front of you, but we want to be as transparent as we can and help people understand what's going on there at the field. Last quarter, we talked about our action plan, and we're seeing improved productivity. We've shifted scope amongst contractors. We've added more engineering support in the field and as we move through this, we're encountering discovery work, as we expected. We found some around piping stress and alignment that we're working on right now. The key thing to think about here is, first of all, there's a lot of stuff that's up and running. All the new wells are producing right now, all this infrastructure, in terms of utility and power distribution and control center, is up and running and as we -- and so that's keeping the plants full and we saw really strong performance last year. I mentioned the strongest in four years and the fourth strongest in the history of the field. So, we're seeing good deliverability out of the new wells, which is the key thing for production this year, is keeping those plants full while we begin to convert the field from pushing into a high-pressure plant to lower back pressure on the field, which improves deliverability from the wells and allows us to extend the life of the field and get up to a million barrels a day. So when we begin converting these metering stations and there are 21 of them, we will then take production from a metering station now that is producing under low pressure and we'll boost that back up to get into the existing plant. As we get more and more of those converted, more of these pressure boost compressors online, we'll get the whole field now producing against the lower back pressure, which gives us a lot of excess well capacity and it ensures that we are going to keep the plant full and as we then bring on the new process equipment, we start to route that low-pressure production into a plant that will run at lower pressure. And so that's really the kind of the high-level description of what we're trying to convey there and we've got a legend that shows you certain things are going to begin start up in various quarters. For FGP, we're focused on commissioning the major equipment there that will allow us to bring up the plant that will take us to a million barrels a day and we're transferring learnings from compressors, pumps, and other things that we're working on now, walking down all the critical substations and we'll continue to provide updates on the key milestones here. We're talking about a couple of gas turbine generators online. First quarter is the Inlet separator is ready for operation and we'll commission that on sweet fluids as we prepare it for sour production and then, as I said, in the second quarter, we begin the PBF startup and metering station conversions. So it's all on track with our guidance and we will continue to provide you detail as we move forward each quarter on specific milestones and progress.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, Pierre. I have to offer my congrats as well and with the quarter today, thanks for making us in the sales side look smart. It's a nice way to go out. So best wishes in retirement.\nPierre Breber: Thank you, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: My question, Mike, is I guess it's got a part A and B, so apologies to Jake on that, but it's kind of around disposals. Our understanding from the Hess side is that despite the fact that you haven't filed the S4 yet, you haven't got the FTC yet, and I realize those processes are ongoing, but the integration planning is still going ahead full steam and I'm just curious if you can offer any color on how that process has evolved as it relates specifically to portfolio high grading. The absence of Malaysia in your go-forward plan, for example, it seems to me the $15 billion number might have a lot of upside. So any color you can offer on that topic, please.\nMike Wirth: Yeah. Doug, it's really premature for us to comment on that until the transaction closes. Hess has a pretty tight portfolio of assets that are performing well and we really need to close the deal, have access to all the data and re-optimize all of our views of portfolio investments and update our new plan and so I don't want to speculate on any assets and look, we've got some of our own assets that we do have out in the public domain already. You may have seen reports on Kaybob Duvernay on Congo. So, there are some divestments that we have signalled out of the Chevron portfolio and I think as you see the divestments unfold over the next few years because we will have more assets in the portfolio that come from Legacy Chevron that is likely to be a greater contributor I would guess to the overall $10 billion to $15 billion number than things that come in through this transaction, but I can't comment on Malaysia or any other particular asset until we get past the close.\nDoug Leggate: A lot of options. Thanks so much. Thanks for the answer.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Silverstein with UBS.\nJosh Silverstein: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Going back to the Permian you're stepping up the CapEx this year to about $5 billion versus $4 billion last year to help you deliver the year-over-year growth. As you continue to ramp towards the million BOE per day target, what's needed from a CapEx standpoint to deliver this growth? Can you stay closer to the $5 billion range or does that step up towards $6 billion in 2025 because you have an accelerating pace to hit that? Thanks.\nPierre Breber: Yeah no. Appreciate the question Josh. We're starting this year with 12 rigs and three frack crews. I mentioned we'll add a fourth frac crew around the middle of the year, but at the same time, we're becoming more efficient. We need fewer rigs to drill the planned lateral feet that we've got out in front of us and so as we as we close in on a million barrels a day, we're at the capital level that I think is going to be required to get us there and then the really nice thing about this is when you're trying to hold the plateau as opposed to grow from seven to eight to nine hundred 700, 800 to 900 to a million a day, you actually can pull capital spending down because you're offsetting decline. You're not trying to offset decline and grow by significant chunks each year and so inflation has moderated and that has been a challenge. We've talked about some of the things we're moving water around a little bit more, but that's embedded in our plan now going forward. So I would not anticipate that we're going to have to go towards $6 billion in order to get there and you know as we as we get to each year, we'll give you an updated guide on it, but when we plateau production capital spending and capital discipline really matters. I just want to emphasize this. We intend to live within our capital means and be really tight on capital and that applies to the Permian along with every other asset.\nOperator: We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you and first I want to congratulate Pierre and thank you for all the years that actually all over the past couple of decades that all the help. We may appreciate.\nPierre Breber: Thanks Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Michael and Pierre, I think Michael when you when you first become the CEO, I think one focus is that course method for you and that full for the last several years, there's a lot of acquisition and change in portfolio. So it's very difficult for us from the outside to see where's your cost structure compared to let's say before the pandemic in 2019? Is there any way that you can help us in terms of what is the structural cost base that for you today compared to say a number of years ago, especially during the early part of the pandemic. You guys did have a restructuring effort. Thank you.\nMike Wirth: Yeah Paul, I don't have all that stuff right on the top of my head to go back to 2019. It's a fair request, but look I think we showed a chart in here over the last several years that our unit costs are relatively flat in fact. I think we're number two on that chart. We don't break out each of the competitors. Our unit OpEx last year was about $15.80 a barrel which is about 5% lower than the year before and we still have outstanding unit optics reduction targets going out to 2026 at mid-cycle. We've had some inflation along the way, but you're right. We took a lot of costs out of the business in 2020 and 2021. So, as we bring together, Hess, and this gets a little bit to the question that Doug was asking as well, we will come out with, an update to investors that talks about the portfolio updates, guidance on all the metrics that matter and I assure you that I have not changed my view that cost control, excuse me, cost control always matters, and capital discipline always matters. So, we will update you on those numbers specifically, Paul.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, and thanks for everything, Pierre. Maybe this one will be an easy or a hard one for you, depending on what you were planning for, but it's about, it's a follow-up on TCO in Kazakhstan and the affiliate dividend guidance and what's interesting about it is that it's flat year-over-year with a commodity assumption that maybe a little bit lower than the prior year and within affiliates, there's also some LNG exposure, which isn't as strong as it was last year, ex-TCO and so, I guess the question is like, you've given this really robust technical update on Tengiz and where we stand, but are we already at a point where TCO is sustaining a level of dividends that's a little bit more stable than it was kind of at the peak of the construction process or the installation process and we're sort of in a progression to this pro-forma, very stable cash flow profile from TCO, or is that number, am I reading too much into that affiliate guidance number? Thank you.\nMike Wirth: Thanks, Sam. Absolutely, TCO dividends are on a higher trajectory just because capital is wound down and as we've said, when we get the incremental production from FGP, it goes even higher. There are some puts and takes. So we talked in last year that TCO had held some surplus cash and released that last year. This year, they're going to have to build some cash as they head into debt payments, which as you recall, we co-lent. So we'll be receiving that. So there are some -- there'll be some timing variation, but your point around the trajectory is absolutely right because CapEx is winding down. So this has been largely self-funded as an affiliate company. As CapEx goes down, there's more cash available. It does depend on commodity price assumptions. You're right, LNG is in there and also petchem. And so those are the major drivers, a little bit of refining are the major drivers of our affiliate dividend. So it's a roughly flat with the prior year. We'll update that as we go along during the year, but absolutely, TCO, we've been investing in that project for eight years. It's going to generate a lot of cash when it comes on next year.\nPierre Breber: Thank you so much and maybe, Sam, just one more point and what you're going to see too is because it's tricky as an affiliate that that line that's affiliate earnings less dividend, that's going to flip, and until you'll see it, it'll be hard for everyone to model it, but what has been historically a line where affiliate earnings are higher than dividends, you will see that flip in time as we pull out more cash out of TCO in particular than the earnings than the book earnings are.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nitin Kumar with Mizuho.\nNitin Kumar: Hi, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. So it's a party in Part A and Part B type of question, but really on the Permian, Mike, in your slides, you highlight that optimize well spacing and maybe coring up where you were drilling in 2023 help the well productivity. At the Analyst Day, you had talked about some technologies and I'm just curious where any of the improvements you saw in '23 related to those and then Part B very quickly, you're growing almost 200,000 barrels from here until in the next two years. Last core, you had some infrastructure issues. What are you doing to get ahead of those infrastructure issues that don't resurface over that plan period?\nMike Wirth: Yeah Nitin, what I would say on technology, I reference the fact that we're drilling more feet out of the same rig fleet, we're improving on completions and so there are a lot of small things that are contributing to the performance that we're seeing right now. The improved recovery technologies are in various stages of being piloted out in the field and so to the extent some of those pilots are in the production, they contribute, but I would say it's at the margin, because we're gathering field data to look at changes in completion and fracture techniques using gas injection and gas lift in different ways using some different chemicals to improve flow. So as we get those into large scale deployment, we'll start to talk about that and we'll help you understand how they're contributing, but I would say right now it's more on the drilling and completions cycle time side that we're seeing some of these improvements and so there's more to come. On midstream infrastructure, some of the issues that we've talked about before can be -- they can be weather related, they can be related to some regulatory items, they can be related to a particular gas processing plant or gathering or off-take pipeline system. We're working all of those because your point is well made as a large producing asset at that scale. We need really, really reliable performance downstream of the wells and we have no constraints on takeaway capacity out of the basin. So we're well positioned, not just for '24 but into '25 and '26 with ultimate takeaway capacity to access the market, but we do have a lot of pipes, pumps, tanks and other things between the field and the market and those things need to perform and that is a high priority for our operations team in the field. As I mentioned, fourth quarter performance was very strong and they're on this and it's a very high priority. We saw a little bit of weather in January, which Pierre guided to that will have a modest impact, but we're confident that we've got a line of sight on all the operational priorities in order to ensure that that market access isn't constrained.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey, thanks for taking my question and Pierre, I want to echo the congrats. Thanks for all the help over the years. I wanted to circle back to TCO and Mike, I think last quarter when you provided the updated guidance on timeline, one of the things that you noted was workforce productivity and I was wondering if you comment on some of the changes that you've implemented to improve labor productivity over the past several months, how it's progressing first plan and in your comments, you mentioned improved scope of work in the context of FGP. I'm not sure that's related to labor or something else, but if you could elaborate on that comment as well, that'd be great. Thanks.\nMike Wirth: Yeah. So, we have multiple contractors working on commissioning and startup and so this is everything from walking systems down to ensure that that they've been properly inspected that we refer to as punch list items have been identified, which is work that still needs to be completed by contractors and then you get into the loop checks and equipment runs and all the work to bring pieces of equipment up into service. So we've got a number of contractors working on this. We've moved scope from contractors that have had lower productivity to those that have exhibited a higher productivity. We've brought in additional resources to beef up the overall capacity and the resources are the contractors that had lower productivity, we've worked with them to understand where are the constraints in the bottlenecks and we've seen one who had a productivity factor as we measure it that was down in the kind of 0.4 range previously is up above 0.7 now and we're targeting to get that up again by a similar quantum. So there's a lot of work on the ground to be sure we've got the right people working on the right things that we have enough contract resources. We're also bringing in technical resources as we discover items that need more technical solutions and that can include company people or vendor people and we're out much further ahead. Last quarter or the quarter before the walk downs and other identification of issues was a few short weeks ahead of the crews that were actually doing this work. We're several weeks now, seven, eight or more weeks out ahead of the teams that are doing the work. So you've got much better ability to plan and execute the work in a much more efficient manner because you've got some time to put the work backs together, get the permitting done, be sure that you've got all the right tools, equipment, etcetera. So it's a great big project, Devin. It's the largest brownfield project and most complex brownfield project I've seen in my life and we're seeing good improvements in terms of the on the ground performance out of our team and out of all the contractor teams that are working on this.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Yeah, hey, I just want to echo everyone's comments. Pierre, been great working with you and good luck in retirement.\nPierre Breber: Thank you, Jason.\nJason Gabelman: I wanted to ask, go back to the Permian Basin and I appreciate the type curve data that you provided in the back of the slide deck. It's a bit difficult to reconcile with the data with the type curves you provided, particularly for the Delaware at the 2023 Capital Markets Day when you forecasted a large improvement in productivity. Can you just talk about if your type curves, particularly in the Delaware basin, ended up in line with where you anticipated them being as shown in that Capital Markets Day type curve?\nMike Wirth: Yeah. So I'll quickly just touch on the Midland Basin where we continue to be a first quartile performer, steady consistent performance. We understand the geology. There's less fluid complexity and so we're a top quartile, first quartile performer there in the Midland. In the Delaware, we last year showed actual data on a Delaware-wide basis and then we showed some forward guidance, particularly focused on New Mexico because we were shifting so much of our program into New Mexico, which, as I mentioned earlier, is a more productive portion of the basin and in the Delaware, New Mexico, we saw significant improvement with our second half POPs. Last year more than 80% of our POPs were in the second half in these more productive areas and the subsurface performance there has been very strong. In the appendix, we've got a slide that shows you 49 POPs out of the 59 POPs were in the second half and you can see that they lay right on the type curve and then you can see the improvement in the Delaware Basin, Texas, which we didn't guide to last year because it was in that combined chart there, but we've seen strong improvement. We've updated our well spacing and completion designs there and within the basin, there are sub-basins and some of those are performing exceptionally strong as well. So we're seeing performance that is very consistent with what we outlined in the markets today last year. I think the shift in basis was just to provide you a little bit more detail into these sub-basins and we'll continue to report on that basis going forward.\nPierre Breber: And just as a reminder, too, Jason, so last year's performance in New Mexico wasn't impacted by long-sitting DUCs. So the year-on-year is bang-on. It's consistent with the set guidance and you see the improvement in Texas because there was the impact from long-sitting DUCs in the prior year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeffrey [ph] with TPH & Company.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up actually on the Permian and specifically ask on the program this year, what kind of opportunity do you see from here for further improvements to spacing and completion design cycle times, if any, in the Texas Delaware region? And could what's working well there translate to New Mexico to make those wells even stronger or quicker to drill and complete or even to the Midland side? And then secondly, how are you all thinking about the mix of capital allocation across these regions within the Permian throughout this year? Thanks.\nMike Wirth: Yeah, so, we're constantly looking to learn and improve and as I mentioned earlier, we've seen significant improvement in drilling time, completion time, time from completion to POP this year and these are a lot of little things, right? This is as you continue doing things, you find more and more efficiencies. We can bring more technology to bear, etcetera. So, and we look to extend those learnings across the basin and frankly between basins. So into the DJ basin and from the DJ basin down to the Permian, there are differences in the sub-basins that you have to understand and respect, but, the short answer is yes. We are looking for ways to transfer, learnings across there and every time I think we're probably, at the plateau in terms of productivity improvement, smart people find ways to continue to get even better at this and so, I don't think we've seen the end of the performance improvement cycle. Our overall capital allocation into the basin is largely a function of where our portfolio lies. About 25% is in the Midland Basin. 25% is in the Delaware, New Mexico portion of the basin and then the balance about 50% is in Delaware, Texas. It's been that way here, this past year and going forward, that's a pretty good way to approximate it.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Hi, good morning, and thanks and congratulations to Pierre. I'm going to give you guys a break on TCO and the Permian. I'm going to ask a question on the DJ. So just looking at this growth of 125 KBD for '24, how should we think about that growth off of a pro forma '23 basin? Just trying to understand what's kind of the underlying, real growth rate in the DJ and then if you could just update us, with a couple quarters behind you now post PDC [ph] on your broader plans for development, the DJ.\nMike Wirth: Yeah, so we've now got a fourth quarter is the first full quarter with PDC. The third quarter we had two months out of the three with PDC in there. And you can see we came in in the fourth quarter a little bit over 400,000 barrels a day, which is our plans are to hold the DJ around 400,000 barrels a day going forward in a highly efficient factory and fourth quarter was maybe even a little stronger than we might have expected. There wasn't as much weather related downtime in November and December and then there were some accounting adjustments that were booked into the fourth quarter that were not really related to operations. So the above 400 is there's a few things contributing to that that probably are not repeating or going to pull back a little bit. But we're confident we can hold around 400,000 barrels a day. We're still executing the well design and well spacing that was in the PDC basis of design, which is a little bit different than ours. A little few more wells and tighter spacing and driven more to drive volume. Our basis of design is more focused on return on invested capital and so it's wider spacing. It's bigger fracks, but it's less capital overall and higher return and so as we transition to a standardized, more standardized basis of design across the basin, you'll see that roll into the numbers. We got four rigs that are going. We got permits out for multiple years, nearly to the end of the decade and so we're very, very pleased and we're learning things. I got to tell you, you know, there's some stuff that we've learned from PDC that will apply not only in the rest of the DJ, but it's going to apply in the Permian as well. It's going to help us. So, going forward, these are high cash margin, low break even barrels. We plan to hold it at a plateau around 400 and we've -- synergies are on track there. We've got virtually all the CapEx synergies are essentially in the bag. We're already down to $1 billion there. OpEx is very close to the $100 million we got into. We're now seeing some procurement synergies, which we hadn't originally envisioned. So everything about it is at or better than what we had guided to.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lucas Herman [ph] with BNP Paribas.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah, thanks very much and Pierre, I'll add my comments to the host already, but thank you for all the insights always been worth listening to. When I look at the growth that you're likely to see in oil in particular over the next two to three years, it feels as though you're going to be adding towards 0.5 million barrels, maybe slightly more barrels of pretty high margin black oil and I guess the question is about whiplash and it's the increased sensitivity that the business is going to have to movement in, of all this high-efficiency. And what, you feel Pierre, Mike, that implies the balance sheet and the way you think about balance sheet and managing things. And just if I could add on, just give me an idea of what the loan repayment schedule looks like at TCO and I presume that loan repayments, will go through the net in the net outline on the CapEx side or the investment side of the equation. Or, do they play elsewhere? Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Right. No, thanks, Lucas. I'll take it. We've been overweight upstream and overweight oil liquids for a long time and you're right. Recent acquisitions and Hess certainly adds to that and we like that exposure. In terms of how we manage the balance sheet, the first thing is we start with our break even. So what it takes, the oil price it takes to cover our CapEx and dividend, that was in the low 50s last year and so we see mostly upside and that's why we had record share buybacks last year, almost $15 billion, 5% of our shares outstanding, because we're built for a price well below where we currently are. We've also done it while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our net debt ratio of 7%. We've said as we keep our share, we purchase this steady across the cycle that we're okay re-levering back up towards the low end of our guidance range, which is 20% to 25%. So that guidance that's a kind of through the cycle net debt ratio guidance, that still holds and if we had a significant change in the portfolio, of course we would look at that going forward, but I think the actions that we're taking are consistent with that guidance and again, adding that exposure when you're built at the break even, when we think about our balance sheet, you take into account lots of things, your portfolio, the commodity price outlook, but your breakeven is really key and Mike was talking about capital and cost discipline, our ability to fund our reinvestment program in both traditional and new energies and grow the company and pay a growing dividend, right? More than twice our nearest peer, greater than S&P 500. We just increased at 8%. So all those numbers are before the latest increase. We can do all that at a low price, return surplus cash. That's how we're going to think about it. So again, you'd expect our net debt to increase over time depending on commodity prices and how we return cash to shareholders. We're not having more exposure to high margin barrels, as you say. That's a good thing. We're built for it and as long as we keep our break even low and below where prices are trading, we're in a really good spot.\nUnidentified Analyst: And how TC loan payments flow through?\nPierre Breber: Oh, yeah. So TC loan payments, sorry about that, yeah, because I alluded to that. That will not be in cash from ops. That shows up in our investing cash. So Jake and the team will take you all through that, but yeah, what I was saying about that affiliate line flipping, that's separate from this in a different line. We will see cash being returned and it's a billion our share next year, again two billion in '26, and then in '28 or '30. So all that's disclosing our 10-K. Jake can take you through that. but yeah, that's only additional and again, we shouldn't be surprised. We've been investing for eight years in this project. That cash is going to come back once the project starts up.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Pierre, thanks. And if you're in London and fancy a game of tennis, give us a buzz. That's what I'll be doing. Sounds good, Lucas.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nIrene Himona: Thank you very much and Pierre, all the best for the next chapter. My question is on Henry Hub. In the new sensitivities you published today, you saw a very material 30% increase in your Henry Hub sensitivity. Is this purely because of PDC and related to that on a macro level, if you can perhaps share your views on the 2024 outlook for Henry Hub, please. Thank you.\nPierre Breber: So I'll start, Irene, and then Mike can take the macro. Yeah, it's a function of PDC, certainly, and then just continued the associated gas that comes along with the Permian. So as we're growing that, it obviously comes along with natural gas.\nMike Wirth: Yeah. And Irene, the macro, I was pulling up the slide on the Henry Hub sensitivity. So broadly speaking, oil markets are pretty balanced right now. I think the geopolitics are the thing that are harder to call and could drive movements one way or another. It could be OpEx plus decisions. It can be this conflict in the Middle East. Economic growth in the world continues to be decent, and our outlook on demand growth for all this year is maybe not quite as strong as last year, but still growing. Gas is a little bit different. The inventories are high in the U.S. Inventories are high in Europe. We're kind of mostly through the wintertime, certainly through the riskiest period of the wintertime and now, there's these questions that are not going to really weigh in the market. In the near term, but maybe longer term, about exports out of the US and so all of that has got, gas markets under a little more pressure than oil markets or refined products and it's not unusual. Pierre was just talking about how we build the company to compete through the cycles and different parts of the portfolio basket. Petrochemicals are under some pressure right now as well and so at any point in time, we're going to find some of the fundamentals, probably under pressure. Others are looking pretty good and here in the short term, I think Henry Hub is in the under pressure category.\nOperator: We'll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. If I look at the production guide of 4% to 7% growth on, say, $3.1 million, and I try to book in that between a fourth quarter closer to 3%-4%, and a 2025 where we're going to see TCO, FGP startup, plus hitting that million barrel a day milestone in the Permian, sort of implies there's an inflection point in production growth coming at some point, or perhaps there's a conservative guide for this year. Is that the right way to think about it?\nMike Wirth: Well, coming into this year, we now have a full year of PDC that will be part of the portfolio. So that's pretty safe in terms of counting on that. I've already mentioned that fourth quarter was a little bit higher than maybe we even might have expected because we had high reliability. Some of these midstream issues we'd faced in the Permian had didn't repeat. We had this accounting catch-up thing in the Permian as well and we had a pretty light turnaround schedule in the fourth quarter. So it was a strong quarter all the way around. As we head into next year, we've got some asset sales in the guidance and, Bob, we've been at the low end. We've kind of ended up last couple of years hitting our guidance range, but at the low end and so I think you could probably think of this as being a little more comfortably in the middle of the range this year, given a number of the things that you mentioned. So, we try to give you guidance each year that we expect to hit, and we certainly expect to hit it this year.\nOperator: We will take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: Thanks for getting me in. My question, Mike, is maybe just on the Chevron return specifically trying to get a sense of, sounds like you will, but just want to get a sense if you'll continue paying out a majority of free cash flow for the remainder of this year and if the buybacks will continue to constitute, a bit over 50% of that payout?\nMike Wirth: Yeah, Neil, we have not used some percentage or range of percentage of cash from operations as kind of a go by for distributions. What we've done is, have leaned on our track record on the dividend, first of all, and we've already clarified what you can expect this year with the 8% increase that we've announced. And then, I would point you back towards our upside and downside guidance that we've had out there now for a number of years, $10 billion to $20 billion on the range for buybacks and that's in an upside price case. We'd be up towards the higher end of that in a lower price case down at the lower end, both of which we can comfortably handle. We have indicated that post the Hess close, all other thing's equal, we'll see when it happens and how the world looks, when we get there, but we would expect to move from a rate of 17.5 to the top end of 20 because we're so confident in the long-term cash productive capacity of our portfolio and the strength of our balance sheet. So rather than focusing in on those percentages, I'd really point you towards the specific guidance that we've issued in the kind of the track record. Now, and of course, I think Pierre mentioned this in his comments. We do remain under SEC restrictions right now relative to the rate at which we can buy back and then we'll be out of the market when the Hess proxy is open and so all of these things are under normal times, we don't have one of those constraints on this.\nPierre Breber: Hey, and I would just add, let me just add a little bit. It's fitting maybe my last words will be on share buybacks, six straight years of buybacks, right, 17 years out of the past 21 years, but we actually bought back more shares last year than the year before, even though earnings and cash flow were higher, right? There were records in '22, still strong in '23. That's the whole point. We're trying to be steady across the commodity cycle. We've heard from investors that buybacks should not be pro-cyclical. And it's hard to be counter-cyclical in the commodity business that has some price volatility. So being steady across the cycle is how we guide to it and these formulas, in fact, reinforce the opposite. They reinforce pro-cyclicality. So we're giving a return that in some ways is almost independent of prices within a range because we're could have paid more out in '22, but we held it back and we use some of that to pay in '23. We'll see where it goes, but the intent is to try to be steady across the cycle, either pro-cyclical nor counter-cyclical. Thanks Neal.\nNeal Dingmann: Pierre, great departure comments. Thank you.\nMike Wirth: I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-10-27 14:36:04", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead.\nJake Spiering: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Wirth: Thanks, Jake. I want to start by acknowledging the tragic events in the Middle East. We are deeply saddened by the loss of life, and our hearts go out to those affected by the war. We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees and their families and the safe delivery of natural gas. Earlier this week, we announced that Chevron entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hess Corporation. We expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2024. And we look forward to providing updates in the future. Now turning to the third quarter. We continued to make progress on our objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon by returning more than $5 billion to shareholders for the sixth consecutive quarter and delivering ROCE greater than 12% for the ninth consecutive quarter; and investing in traditional energy by closing the PDC Energy acquisition and in new energies by acquiring a majority stake in a green hydrogen production and storage hub in Utah. And earlier this month, we released our Climate Change Resilience Report which details our approach, actions and progress in reducing carbon intensity and growing new, lower carbon businesses. I encourage everyone to read the report, available on Chevron.com. At TCO, base business continues to deliver good results. The planned turnaround was completed ahead of schedule, the reservoir is performing well and the plant remains full. We expect a higher dividend in the fourth quarter. TCO has achieved mechanical completion at the Future Growth Project. Following slower-than-expected commissioning progress, we conducted an independent cost and schedule review. We now forecast the Wellhead Pressure Management Project, which is the field conversion from high pressure to low pressure, to begin start-up in the first half of 2024 and to continue through two major train turnarounds. FGP is expected to start-up in the first half of 2025 and ramp to full production within three months. Total project cost is expected to increase between 3% to 5%. TCO production on a 100% basis in 2024 is forecasted to be about 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day lower than 2023 due to a heavier turnaround schedule and planned downtime for WPMP conversions. TCO is expected to reach greater than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025 when FGP fully ramps up. Free cash flow from TCO in 2025 is expected to be more than $4 billion, Chevron's share at $60 Brent, down around $1 billion from our prior estimate. Our focus remains on safe and reliable commissioning and start-up. I'll now turn it over to Pierre to discuss the financials.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Mike. We delivered another quarter with strong earnings, cash flow and ROCE. This quarter's results included two special items: a one-time tax benefit of $560 million in Nigeria and pension settlement costs of $40 million. Foreign currency benefits were $285 million. The appendix of this presentation contains a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Organic CapEx this quarter included about $200 million for PDC legacy operations after closing in August. Our balance sheet remains strong, ending the quarter with a net debt ratio in the single digits. Another quarter of solid cash flow enabled us to deliver on all of our financial priorities. Despite restrictions during the PDC transaction, we were able to repurchase well over $3 billion in Chevron shares. Cash used to reduce debt was primarily related to PDC's higher cost borrowing. Cash balances ended the quarter near $6 billion, a little above what's needed to run our businesses. Adjusted third quarter earnings were down $5.1 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted upstream earnings were lower mainly due to realizations and negative timing effects. Higher unfavorable discrete tax charges and exploration expenses were partly offset by lower DD&A, Venezuela cash recoveries and other favorable items. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to a negative swing in timing effects and lower marketing margins. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down just over $50 million. Adjusted upstream earnings were roughly flat as higher prices and volumes were offset by unfavorable discrete tax charges and negative timing effects due to the rise in prices. DD&A and OpEx were both higher in part due to the addition of PDC legacy assets for two months in the quarter. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily due to higher refining margins, partially offset by unfavorable timing effects. All other was down on unfavorable tax items and decreased interest income in line with lower cash balances. Third quarter oil equivalent production was up 6% over last quarter primarily due to two months of legacy PDC production. This was partly offset by a planned turnaround at TCO and pitstop at Gorgon. The Permian, excluding legacy PDC, was down 2% due to lower non-operated production; company-operated production was flat with the second quarter. Now, looking ahead. Our fourth quarter estimate for turnarounds and downtime includes approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for Tamar. We anticipate affiliate dividends in the fourth quarter to be largely from TCO. As a reminder, we record a 15% withholding tax on TCO dividends. Due to the pending transaction with Hess, share repurchases will be restricted pursuant to SEC regulations. Chevron expects share repurchases in the fourth quarter to be around $3 billion plus or minus 20%, depending primarily on the timing of the Hess definitive proxy statement mailing. In summary, our actions and performance show that Chevron keeps delivering strong results. With a strategy that remains clear and consistent, we are well positioned to deliver value to our shareholders in any environment. With that, I'll turn it back to Jake.\nJake Spiering: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. To allow for questions from more participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Katie, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping we could dig into the international upstream, just a little short on what we were expecting this quarter, what some of the factors were, other than the ones called out, the FX issue and the tax benefit in Nigeria.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Roger. Look, I'll let Pierre cover this in a little more detail, but there's \u2013 I recognize this quarter was a tough one to model. And there's pretty material or significant non-cash charges. Timing effects, primarily inventory costs, we see with rising prices some tax reserves and charges for legal abandonment and other things and then some lower realizations with your mix and the lag effect in some of our LNG pricing. On timing and inventory costs in particular, on period-to-period comparisons where we had a prior period, whether it was last quarter or the same quarter last year, where prices were coming down and then in the current period, we see prices strengthening significantly, you really get pretty significant deltas on the way we cost inventory. And if you go back to the, I think, the first quarter of 2022, we had some similar dynamics. So anyway, that's kind of high level on it. Pierre, maybe you can talk a little bit more about the upstream and international upstream in particular.\nPierre Breber: Yes, it's a subset of what you talked to, Mike, Roger. So timing effects, the largest timing effects this quarter were on cargoes on the water. So you'll see that primarily in the international upstream, international downstream. Timing effects are in three buckets. You have paper mark-to-market, you have on-the-water inventory and then you have on-land inventory. So it's really cargoes on the water that drive most of the effect, cargoes that are in transit and cross over quarterly periods. And so that's what the trajectory of prices, as Mike indicated, is really what drives that. Mike talked about abandonment estimate. So those will show up in depreciation. And we saw that in the international upstream. And then in LNG, you see some lag pricing. We also saw some mix between contract cargoes and spot cargoes on LNG. And on the liquid side, we saw some mix effects. So it's a bit of where the liftings are relative to production in terms of tax jurisdictions, the types of products, how they trade in terms of discounts to Brent. So there were a number of items in international upstream. And you could follow-up, Roger, with Jake and cover any more details.\nRoger Read: No, thanks. I'll sum it up as messy. I appreciate it. Thanks.\nMichael Wirth: We gave [indiscernible] quarter every now and again. Go ahead, Katie.\nOperator: I apologize. We'll take our next question from Josh Silverstein with UBS.\nJoshua Silverstein: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. On the TCO, you had mentioned that in 2025, you expect the cash flow to be about $1 billion lower, around $4 billion versus $5 billion previously. Is that just due to the project delays? Or is there higher cost estimates now in that, so it would be lower distributions from there? Or is there something else that's driving that?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. So Josh, there's going to be some more capital, we said 3% to 5%. So think about around $1 billion Chevron share over 2024 and 2025, probably a little more weighted to 2024 than 2025. Cash flow from the operations will be lower by about $1.5 billion at $60 Brent in total over the next two years really due to the delay in the project. So it's equivalent to about 50,000 barrels a day in net production in each of those years. So in total, we expect our share of dividends to be lower by about $2.5 billion across 2024 and 2025 from the prior guidance. And so it's a combination of those things. And so we had previously guided to above $5 billion. We're now seeing above $4 billion and a little more of that coming from production and cash flow from ops as opposed to CapEx.\nPierre Breber: And the delay in WPMP doesn't have any impact really because there was no incremental production. So the effects that Mike was talking about in production are really from the delay in the start-up of FGP, which obviously adds incremental production.\nMichael Wirth: Thank you, Josh.\nJoshua Silverstein: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Thank you. I just want to stay on the TCO question. As you think about, Mike, the biggest gating factors to getting from here to completion around FGP, just walk us through the landscape and the key milestones that you'll be watching and we should be watching to give us conviction that the project is coming into service.\nMichael Wirth: Yes. So the main message here, Neil, is as we completed both WPMP and then mechanical completion of FGP and we've begun to get deep into the commissioning, we've, I think, previously mentioned we worked with some technical issues with our utility systems. And as we did that and we saw some of these impacts, we commissioned an independent cost and schedule review off cycle. We normally do these annually, but we didn't want to wait. And so as we saw some of this evidence that things were going slower, there were some more discovery work, we sent in an independent team to give us kind of a cold eyes assessment on cost and schedule. And I think the main thing that I would distill that down to is the recommendations from that and that are embedded in our updated guidance today reflect a more conservative forecast of commissioning progress. And so we're assuming things will take longer than the prior plan. We're assuming we're going to have discovery items that tend to come up in complex projects like this. And in response, we've implemented some significant changes in terms of how we're approaching this. We've moved contract resources over from 3GI, which is a portion of the Future Growth Project, which is now completed and fully commissioned over onto the other commissioning work. So we've added contract resources there. We brought in experienced turnaround and operations people that are very skilled in the discovery work, in managing through the restart of and operations of facilities now to help us with this. And then we've also added technical resources to address any unplanned discovery items that would come up. So we've had a significant change in our approach to this. We've got a more conservative guidance here that we're issuing now. And we'll continue to talk about this every quarter. I guess, the main things to look at here are we've got big compressor trains that will start up for pressure boost, which is a key driver of this high-pressure to low-pressure conversion. These are very large machines. And so those are key milestones. After that, we've got metering stations that are converted from high pressure or low pressure. And so over the next few quarters \u2013 and there's, I think, 40-some-odd metering stations as you go out through the entire field. We've got these two big turnarounds that I've talked about. All of those are really key milestones that we'll be tracking very closely. And we'll update you on those as we go forward.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just stick with upstream, but actually ask about Venezuela. You've had some increase in production year-over-year, given the initial sanction relief. And there's obviously been some additional sanction relief announced just since the last quarterly call. I think you might have been on an interview this morning. You made some comments that you could see a sequential increase in production between now and year-end. I was wondering if you could just step back, talk through what impact this sanction relief has on your production profile and also willingness to invest in that region. And can you remind us how impactful Venezuela volumes are for your corporate cash flow?\nMichael Wirth: Sure. So yes, we have seen some action now from the U.S. government. We had been previously operating under an OFAC license, which was modified at the beginning of this year, a general license. There's some specific licenses that go with that, that define the terms under which we can operate. The recent action in the new general license issued by OFAC really kind of opens up operating room for others more so than it does for us. We already \u2013 it doesn't materially change our circumstances here. And so I think what you'll see is some more people lifting crude, bring it to the \u2013 you'll see more crude flow to the U.S. I don't think the \u2013 the impact on our operations really is not particularly significant. We are up to something around 130,000 barrels a day from maybe 60,000 barrels a day earlier this year. We still think we can get to 150,000 or so by year-end. So we are seeing improvements and expect there's some more that we can see through the balance of the year. And that's driving \u2013 the cash from that is going to pay legitimate operating expenses, tax and royalties, recover some past dues that we are owed. And we're really working on what I would call pretty straightforward field maintenance and things to restore production that aren't particularly long cycle or capital-intensive and staying within the kind of cash that's being generated from those sales in order to fund that. I would expect that's the posture we'll remain in for a while here until we see how the longer-term sanctions environment plays out, the political situation in the country with elections and the like and continue to make progress on recovery of the past dues that I mentioned. And so not a lot of change, I guess, I would say, from our point of view. Pierre, maybe you want to comment on the cash and production.\nPierre Breber: Yes. Consistent with what Mike just said, we're continuing to do cost affiliate accounting, which means we are not \u2013 we don't record production or reserves, right? So that's not reflected in our numbers. And we only record earnings when we receive cash. So we're not \u2013 we're recording a proportionate share of equity earnings, but only what we actually receive in cash. And that's something that we'll continue to look at. And as Mike said, depending on all those potential triggers down the road, elections and such, we could go back to equity accounting at some point in time. But we have not made that decision yet. In terms of cash flow, it's about 1% of our cash flow. So it's modest, of course. But it's more than it was before. And so as Mike said, operations there are continuing well. And we're getting a little bit of cash. And we'll just see where it goes from here.\nDevin McDermott: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Wirth: Thank you, Devin.\nOperator: We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: All right. Thanks for taking my question. I'm sure you get a few more on TCO. I just want to ask about the Permian. Last quarter, you gave some very helpful data points on well productivity this year. I was wondering, particularly for the New Mexico side, if you had any incremental comments for wells driven in the third quarter. Because I know it was a pretty small sample size of POPs in the first half of the year. So any comments there would be helpful. Thank you.\nMichael Wirth: Yes. And I might give you some kind of broader commentary on Permian performance as well. Overall, production was down just a little bit, about 2% in the quarter. That was entirely driven by non-operated joint ventures. And primarily, a couple of the operators had delays in putting wells online due to frac hits and some other factors. There was also some takeaway capacity on the Permian highway that \u2013 constraints that resulted in some unplanned downtime. So co-op production in the third quarter was essentially flat from the prior quarter, which is what we had guided to. And that's despite having some wells that were choked back due to some surface constraints. In one development area, we're seeing higher-than-expected CO2 content in the gas and others in the area are as well. So we've got third-party handling and process facilities that are constrained by that and can't handle all the CO2. So we're choking wells back. There's a new federal regulation that I won't get into the details. But it affects how we meter production. And it prevents co-mingling. And so we've got wells choked back until we can get some new meters in place. And then we've got some produced water limits that have come into effect in some areas. So there's a number of things that are not indicative of well performance, but other surface realities that we're working on our way through that are impacting co-op production a little bit. In New Mexico, you're right. We got more POPs in the second half of the year. We've POP-ed about 60% of the planned wells in New Mexico. So the balance, almost half, come on in the fourth quarter. POP performance has generally been strong. Some of those wells are hit by the facility constraints that I've talked about. But overall, well performance is aligned with our type curve expectations. I think when we get to the fourth quarter call, Biraj, we'll come back with some more detail on type curves. We'll have enough of them online. We'll have enough months that we can start to give you some of the same kind of evidence that we did last quarter to show you the performance.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.\nMichael Wirth: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nMichael Wirth: Good morning, Sam.\nSam Margolin: Maybe we'll stick with the U.S. and ask about just the U.S. upstream CapEx number. There's a lot of moving parts in here. You've got incorporation of PDC. You have kind of GOM projects and Ballymore coming into play, inflation and then timing effects that you alluded to. I guess, when you think about this quarter's U.S. upstream capital, how would you characterize it just overall? Would you say it's sort of on plan or like overly influenced by any one of these factors that may or may not be mitigated over time? Thank you.\nMichael Wirth: Yes. Sam, you're right. I mean, we are seeing pressure in the U.S. And I think we're probably going to end up higher than our budget as we end the year. PDC is being integrated into the factory pretty much as we expected. And so it's an increment because it wasn't in our original plan. But it's really not a driver of this. The big thing is we're seeing actually more feet drilled per rig and more completion feet than we had planned. And so the productivity of the primary development activity has continued to improve. But that means we spend more money on tubulars, on sand, on water than we had anticipated. So it's kind of a good news, but it brings with it some costs. We've got some long lead items, where we're seeing supply chain realities that say we need to place long lead orders earlier. So some things we otherwise would have ordered next year that we've actually moved ordering and initial payments on into this year. So there's some long lead dynamics going on. And then I mentioned earlier, produced water is becoming an issue, the reinjection of that and doing that in a way that minimizes the incidences of induced seismicity. So we've got some more produced water handling infrastructure spend. So I would say those are kind of the primary drivers. And that's pushing the Permian to be a little hot. Gulf of Mexico is pretty well right on plan. And so what you're seeing there is really a function of PDC, which is just an increment that's been added, and then some additional costs in the Permian program that we really hadn't anticipated as we went into the year.\nPierre Breber: Hey, I'll just add. So if you take out inorganic, which is $600 million year-to-date, $400 million in the third quarter for \u2013 primarily for ACES and the $200 million that we had for PDC in the third quarter, through third quarter year-to-date, we're about $200 million above the ratable budget. Of course, fourth quarter tends to be higher. So as Mike says, we'll likely end the year a little bit above budget.\nSam Margolin: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning.\nMichael Wirth: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Mike, can I get back \u2013 can I go back to TCO? It's a little bit of the late stage for the cost increase and everything. I guess the question is that, I mean, what have we learned from this process and to ensure that your future project execution will become better and not facing the kind of problem that, I mean, it has been a challenging project that all along due to a number of different reasons. But quite frankly that this is a bit disappointing at this very last stage for the bit of the slip in the schedule and also the cost increase? Thank you.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Paul. Thank you. And look, I share the sentiment. So I understand where you're coming from. Big complex projects, you've been along for the whole ride. So you know early on, there were some engineering issues that we confronted and addressed. In the middle of it, the big thing was the pandemic and demobilizing, remobilizing, building medical facilities and a whole bunch of stuff that we had to manage our way through and was complex and difficult. And our folks did a great job, but it clearly impacted cost and schedule. And the big thing here, Paul, is as we've gotten into \u2013 and you have to remember, this is \u2013 we're redoing the power infrastructure for the entire field, which is, geographically speaking, it's an enormous space. And this is infrastructure, frankly, it goes back a lot of it to kind of Soviet days. So there's an entire new power distribution system. We're taking the entire field and taking it from high-pressure production to lower pressure in the WPMP process and then building the really large sour gas injection and incremental production facilities. And it's \u2013 so it's almost a field-wide refurbishment of a lot of it and then this big increment of production. And the commissioning of that is incredibly complex. And as we went in and did this cost and schedule review early in \u2013 relatively early in the commissioning process, based on what we were seeing, what became evident is that we need to account for that complexity in our schedule. And I don't think it was fully reflected in the schedule. And in a big, complex project like this, you find things. And early on, we found challenges in the utility system. And it cost us some time. And it \u2013 that ripples through. And so the guidance we're giving you now is really what I would say is it's more conservative because it assumes that those kinds of things are going to be encountered for the balance of the project. And we need to set expectations that those are the realities that we're going to be dealing with. And so that's why the schedule lights all in commissioning. It's \u2013 bulk construction is completed. All the equipment is there. And this really is the final commissioning process. If we do well, we could end up on the front end of those windows that I gave you. But we've given you those because our experience says we should not plan for that, we had to plan for the reality of these things. And as I mentioned in response to the earlier question by Neil, we've added incremental resources in multiple areas now, ought to be \u2013 to anticipate and be prepared for these kinds of challenges. And so I think the lesson is on the projects like this, of which there are a few, in the future, our commissioning plans will reflect that complexity more completely than the commissioning plans did on this one.\nPierre Breber: And I'll just add some comments on affiliate dividends. So we've given a guide on fourth quarter affiliate dividends, which falls short of the full-year guide that we did at the start of the year. That shortfall is not from TCO, that's from CPChem, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, on lower petchem margins. It's also from Angola LNG on lower TTF prices than we had assumed. We've also had some of the Angola LNG cash has come back to us as return to capital. In terms of TCO, we had a $600 million dividend Chevron share in the second quarter. We can't get ahead of the TCO Board on the fourth quarter. But 90% or so of the fourth quarter guide is related TCO. I'll remind you last year that TCO dividend was $1.6 billion Chevron share. All these numbers are before the withholding tax. So we'll see a pretty significant increase in the total year TCO dividend. Now some of that was the \u2013 getting some of the excess cash off the balance sheet like we were talking about. But if you go back to the period prior to the start of this construction, so the period into 2015, we're seeing dividends now \u2013 or this year's dividend will be similar to what we saw from that time period. So the inflection is happening after five years of either not receiving dividends or, in fact, putting cash out, essentially having negative free cash flow. So we know production is going to be down next year. We showed that. So you'd expect dividends to reflect that a little bit. We have a little bit of increase in CapEx. And then we'll be heading to this more than $4 billion in 2025. And all of that is \u2013 that guidance is at $60. So we're seeing some positive news in terms of the cash flow coming out. Clearly disappointing news on the revised schedule, but we're going to work hard to deliver it in the front end of the range. Thanks, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for my question. So I have a follow-up on the Permian ex PDC. You were down 2% in 3Q, including the non-op piece, and really helpful color there from Mike on Biraj's question. But just \u2013 it does leave a pretty big jump to hit guidance in 4Q, around 10%, if I calculate it right. So are you sticking with that 770,000 guide for the legacy piece? And if not, is there a good way to think about 4Q production in general?\nMichael Wirth: Yes, John, we're not changing the guidance. Overall on production, excluding PDC, we expect to be the lower end of overall guidance. Permian production is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter. Full year production expected around 770,000, 780,000 or so if you include PDC. And so yes, the guidance is still intact for the Permian. Go ahead, Pierre.\nPierre Breber: Yes. Mike talked about the 2% shortfall on non-op, which averages to about 0.5%. He talked about also some of these surface constraints. So we have worked to overcome the shortfall we saw in non-op in the third quarter to deliver that. So no change in guidance. But clearly, we have a little more work to do in the fourth quarter to achieve it. We do expect though fourth quarter, more POPs and more production, in line with the plan that we laid out earlier this year.\nJohn Royall: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDouglas Leggate: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Mike, I know you've been traveling around, so thank you for making the time for us this morning. I want to try and defend you a little bit here this morning. Because if you look at the remaining life of Tengiz, about half of that value has been taken out of your stock this morning. I can't imagine you're happy about announcing another series of challenges. So my question is this, at a philosophical level, how would you characterize what you and your management team and the organization are doing to avoid these kind of issues on major projects going forward? You've got a lot of things in the queue through 2027. Why should the market be comfortable that you can execute on that timeline with what you have in your portfolio?\nMichael Wirth: Well, Doug, you're right. I think there has been a reaction apparently in the market this morning to this. We've spent a lot of time \u2013 I'll go back to Jay Johnson spending time not only in these calls but on traveling around, talking about what we're doing on capital project execution. This is a unique project. And I won't repeat the things that I went through earlier with Paul. But this is a large, multiyear effort that had supply chains coming in from all the way around the world through the Russian inland waterway system through the pandemic. And we've had our challenges with it. There are not projects in our queue that are remotely similar to this one. The kinds of things that we're talking about now are factory development projects across multiple shale basins. They're deepwater developments that I think the track record on those is quite different. And so I think the lessons on these really complex capital projects are that despite employing the best engineering and construction firms in the world, bringing in partners that have strong capability, they are really complex and challenging. And part of the way we mitigate that is we'd be very selective about the ones we do. We walked away from the Kitimat LNG project because we \u2013 despite a lot of efforts to make that project better, we had concerns about execution in that kind of an environment and ultimately said we're not going to take on a project like that, particularly at this point in time. And so part of it is the way you choose what you do. Part of it is continuing to learn and apply those learnings, many of which from a decade ago have been implemented into the TCO project. But some of which from the TCO project will be implemented and integrated into other projects that go forward of similar complexity. So look, we're close to the finish line on this thing. And we've got a full-court press on it to make sure that the commissioning is safe and reliable and we have a clean start-up. And the lessons from that will be applied in every other project that we do.\nPierre Breber: And I'll just restate the impact that Mike \u2013 yes, thanks, Doug. And I'll just restate the impact that Mike talked about. It's $2.5 billion, that's at $60, that's less than $1.50 a share. So clearly, they were down a lot more than that. We talked about the earnings in this. We know that weighs also on the shares, at the same time, non-cash items, timing effects that reverse and discrete items that are nonrecurring. So we feel good about the company's performance in the quarter in terms of how we operated safely and reliably, how we captured margin. We know, as Mike said earlier, we have these quarters where it can be messy, can be noisy. It's one of them. But the underlying company is very strong and healthy.\nDouglas Leggate: I agree. It looks overdone, Pierre. Thanks so much.\nPierre Breber: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Irene Himona with Societe Generale.\nIrene Himona: Thank you very much. Good morning. You're referring to your comments to higher OpEx and DD&A from the PDC legacy assets having impacted Q3 upstream. Now that you own that business fully and you can sort of look under the bonnet, how are you thinking about your original synergy estimates on PDC OpEx and CapEx? And how long would you expect it takes for those to start accruing to you in the results? Thank you.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Irene. So I think that the reference was simply these are additive to \u2013 versus prior periods. And so I wouldn't want anybody to interpret that somehow they were different than what we expected because the OpEx and the DD&A are not different than what we expected. Synergy capture is good. We're right on track to capture all of the synergies. No change to the guidance. We're confident that there's upside. And we'll realize that over time as we have on other transactions. We think there's additional operational midstream and procurement synergies that we didn't build into our initial target. And the CapEx synergy has been captured as well. So the nice thing about this in a quarter, where I appreciate Doug's view that maybe the reaction here has been a little over, we closed the transaction five months ahead of guidance. We pick up additional production for a bigger part of the year, the earnings and cash flow that go along with that. We've already paid off some high-cost debt. And so we're integrating that into our business now. And it's a very sound transaction that is going to deliver, I think, everything that we expected and then some.\nIrene Himona: Thank you very much.\nMichael Wirth: Thanks, Irene.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Hi. Hello.\nMichael Wirth: Good morning, Jason. Yes, we are here.\nJason Gabelman: Hi. Sorry, about that. Good morning.\nMichael Wirth: Sorry to wake you up, Jason.\nJason Gabelman: Yes. Hi. Can you hear me?\nMichael Wirth: I can.\nJason Gabelman: Okay. Good. I wanted to ask about what's going on in your Middle East footprint. You've obviously had to take Tamar offline. I believe that's a fixed price asset that you're receiving, so probably not a large cash impact. But if you could remind us what the cash impact is and the ability to maybe reroute that gas somewhere else or offset those losses, and then how you think about the Eastern Mediterranean growth profile overall, if there's any change how you're thinking about it in light of the recent events over there. Thanks.\nMichael Wirth: Yes, I'll take the second part of that and then ask Pierre to address the cash and production impact. It doesn't change our view on the development opportunities really at all, Jason. This is a long-term play. It's a very, very large gas resource. We like some of the follow-on exploration opportunities in the region. We're working on the Aphrodite field in the waters offshore Cyprus to develop. We're working expansion projects that have been sanctioned on both Tamar and Leviathan and further expansion ideas on Leviathan. And so we've got to take a long-term view, which is measured in years and decades. And when you have things in the short-term that create the circumstances that we see right now, we have to be prepared to mitigate those risks and to keep people safe and maintain the integrity of our operations. But it doesn't change our long-term view on the attractiveness of the asset and the development opportunities. I'll let Pierre address the cash question.\nPierre Breber: Yes. We don't talk about our specific contracts, and there's numbers of them. But I think, in effect, you're right, there's some escalators tied to inflation. There's some oil price sensitivity. But it's within sort of a floor and a ceiling. And these are regional gas prices that are well below international prices. So we don't know how long. We gave the guide on the production and the impact on cash flow is very modest. It's tens of millions of dollars in terms of doing the calculation. And so we'll just see where we end up in the quarter and how long it is shut in for. Thanks, Jason.\nJason Gabelman: Okay.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. Maybe switch gears a little bit to the Gulf of Mexico. Can you maybe just provide any update on an overall basis? Do you anticipate the addition of the Hess assets in the Gulf to have any impact on your approach to the basin in the coming years? And then you're scheduled to have three separate projects hitting at Anchor, St. Malo and Whale come onstream during 2024. Could you maybe update us on the progress of those projects and maybe the timing whether we should expect those in the first half or the second half of the year?\nMichael Wirth: Sure. So on the combination with Hess, I think we'll come back to you as we close the transaction and we integrate those. We're partners in a couple of projects that they operate. We both have lease positions out there. I think you would expect us to high-grade the exploration program as we look across a larger combined lease position and \u2013 but we'll talk to you more about that as we go forward. In terms of specific projects, yes, you're right, we've \u2013 Mad Dog 2 actually saw first oil this year. And we expect peak next year on Mad Dog 2. You can refer to the operator for more on that. Anchor and Whale are both expected for first oil next year. Anchor is seven wells in total, two that will be online in 2024, three in 2025 \u2013 no, two in 2025, two in 2026 and one then in 2027. The FPU is safely moored out there in the field right now. The manifold and pump systems and subsea manifolds are all fabricated. We've landed and tested the 20,000 psi blowout preventer. So that project is moving along nicely. Production in 2024 is modest because there's only a couple of wells online. Think of it midyear in terms of general timing. I'd refer you to Shell on the Whale project, first oil probably the latter part of 2024 and a similar kind of a profile, where you've got a smaller number of wells online initially. And then over the subsequent couple of years, you're going to see additional wells come online. And so the production impact of that starts to show up in 2025 and 2026 in a greater way than it does in 2024. And then Ballymore is actually first oil in 2025, not 2024. But that will come online in 2025, simpler development, tiebacks to Blind Faith, three wells, two of which would be online in 2025. The third one would come online in 2026. And so again, the production on that, a little bit in 2025 and then you'll see more of it in 2026 and 2027.\nPierre Breber: Ryan, just more broadly on Hess, we are not planning to hold our Investor Day at our usual timing. We'll likely either have just closed or will be in the antitrust review process. This is a big transaction impacting Gulf of Mexico but transforms the portfolio overall. We gave some guidance on potential asset sales also. So you should expect us to do an Investor Day several months after we close and when we have time to really put together a combined business plan for our investors.\nRyan Todd: Thank you.\nPierre Breber: Thanks, Ryan.\nMichael Wirth: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: We'll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. You've spent part of the week engaging with your shareholder base and making the case for the acquisition of Hess. Can you talk to, not details, obviously, but perhaps the tone of those conversations, the enthusiasm, anything that surprised you?\nMichael Wirth: I'd say overall \u2013 and of course, we met with \u2013 I was out. Pierre was in some separate meetings than I was. But I was out in a number of meetings with John Hess, sometimes the larger Hess shareholders, sometimes with larger Chevron shareholders. I would say, in general, people see the long-term value proposition very clearly here. And I think they see it as a combined company that is stronger and one that is set up to be stronger for longer with the ability to really sustain cash distributions to shareholders in a very consistent, predictable and durable fashion long into the future. And so that is \u2013 there's no doubt about that. Some of the questions, on the one side, did you get a high enough price? On the other side, did you pay too much, right? So there was tension in the \u2013 in that, to be honest, during the negotiation. It was \u2013 as we mentioned, this has been going on for some time. And John and I have been looking for a way to do a deal that is actually one that's good for both sets of shareholders and not easy because it's a great asset and the market recognizes that value. And so I think you can find nuances from people who either held one of the stocks or the other for certain reasons. And maybe this wasn't exactly what they expected. But broadly speaking, I would say people see the long-term value creation. They see the transparency to resource depth, to production growth. The fact that you now have \u2013 with Hess, you've got a much more diversified set of assets attached to their portfolio, which derisks any one of those assets. And it brings forward cash distributions to their shareholders meaningfully that would have still been several years into the future. For the Chevron shareholders, who were wondering what comes next after what they can currently see over the next several years in our portfolio, rather than us pointing to a range of potential answers to that and say, \"We'll do the best of these,\" and we've got plenty of organic investment opportunities we're working on, I think it gives some confidence and certainty of what underpins that for the future. And so broadly speaking, those are the kinds of discussions that we've had.\nBob Brackett: Very quick. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. My question, Mike, is more on your shareholder return. You continue to have great financials and the shareholder return, both on the dividend and the buyback side, continues to be quite high, paying out a bit over 100% of your free cash flow. I'm just wondering, as you continue to have the growth opportunities ahead you do, do you see any change in that shareholder return, particularly on the share buyback or you continue to try to balance kind of the growth and buyback programs you have now?\nMichael Wirth: Yes. We've had a very consistent set of financial priorities for many, many years. The first of which is to sustain and grow the dividend, 36 consecutive years now of per share dividend payouts for the last five years has been a 6% CAGR. Actually, I think the last 15 years have been a 6% CAGR and an announcement of 8% early next year, subject to Board approval. I think there's a strong track record there you can expect to continue. Second is to be disciplined in organic reinvestment into the business to grow those cash flows. You can be confident that we will continue to be disciplined in that reinvestment to drive returns and value. Number three is a strong balance sheet. Pierre mentioned we're single-digit net debt ratio today. That's lower than we have guided to over time. And so over time, you can expect the balance sheet to move back towards the 20% to 25% gearing range that we've identified as where we're comfortable through the cycle. And then the fourth are the share repurchases. And we've got a range now of $10 billion to $20 billion. We're at the high end of that range when we close the transaction with Hess with $17.5 billion annually. Today, that's 5% to 6% of our float each and every year. And we've \u2013 I won't go through the details, but we've indicated we can sustain that in a lower price environment. And that's where the lower end of that range would apply. And certainly in a higher price environment, which is where we find ourselves today, we're at the high end of that range. And so we would expect to be consistent, predictable and to sustain that. I mean, consistent and durable being the keywords here. So I think the broad framework is likely to remain unchanged. And I think our behavior will be very consistent with what you've come to see from us historically.\nNeal Dingmann: Okay. Thanks, Mike.\nMichael Wirth: Thank you, Neal.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Alastair Syme with Citi.\nAlastair Syme: Thanks. Hi, Mike, Pierre and Jake. Can I go back to Hess? For several years, Chevron has looked a bit different to the other integrated oil companies in terms of the low downstream exposure. And of course, now you're re-weighting even further to the upstream. So does that balance bother you at all? Or maybe how do you think about what an integrated oil company is?\nMichael Wirth: Yes, Alastair, the short answer is no, it doesn't bother me. We actually have been becoming a more downstream-weighted company the last several years. And that may not be obvious to most people, but we've been \u2013 our CapEx into the upstream has been below our depreciation. So our upstream business has been declining as a percentage of capital employed. In the downstream, we've made some big investments. We acquired a refinery in Texas. We acquired a renewable energy company. We've invested in new petrochemical facilities. We've got two more of those petrochemical expansion projects underway right now. And so we had gone from 80-20 weighting or 85-15 weighting upstream to downstream and chemicals to 80-20 over the last few years. When we close this transaction, we'll be back at 80-20, which is \u2013 or 85-15, I'm sorry, which is where we've historically been. And that reflects a fundamental view that we believe that over the cycle, returns in the upstream are likely to be structurally higher than in the downstream primarily because refineries are hard to close. They get built for reasons other than just pure economics. And governments tend to intervene in transportation fuels markets, in particular, when prices are high, which kind of takes you out of full cycle economics. And they kind of clip \u2013 tend to put the peaks off of those, whereas in the upstream, you've got a declining resource base and you've got growing demand. And so the fundamentals rebalance more quickly. You remove a little bit of investment. And you see decline takeover and you see demand continue to grow. And so markets get imbalanced and the upstream rebalance more quickly. We also have been more oil-weighted than some of our peers. And fundamentally, that reflects a view that there are more alternatives to substitute for gas, particularly in power generation than there are for liquids in transportation. And so those are kind of high-level drivers of why our portfolio has been constructed the way that it is. We want to be an integrated company. We think there are real opportunities to capture economic value through integration to build the capabilities to run our entire business by bringing capabilities, technology, skills to bear across those different segments. But our peers are all weighted more to the up than the downstream. The ratios are a little bit different. And we've long held those views and constructed a portfolio that reflects them. Thanks for your question.\nAlastair Syme: Thank you, Mike.\nMichael Wirth: You bet.\nJake Spiering: I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Chevron's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-07-28 14:20:03", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead.\nJake Spiering: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website.  Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Wirth: Thank you, Jake. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Earlier this week, we announced several senior leadership changes, including Pierre's plans to retire next year, along with second quarter performance highlights. In a few minutes, Pierre will share more details on our financials, which included return on capital employed greater than 12% for the eighth consecutive quarter and another quarterly record in shareholder distributions of more than $7 billion.  At TCO, we're making good progress with commissioning and pre-start up activities, including introducing fuel gas to new facilities. In the third quarter, we expect mechanical completion for the Future Growth Project and to complete a major turnaround. Cost and schedule guidance is unchanged. Conversion of the field from high-pressure to low-pressure is expected to begin late this year and FGP is on track to start up by mid-next year.  We have unused contingency which gives us confidence that we'll complete the project within the total budget. After completion of these projects, TCO is expected to deliver production greater than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and generate about $5 billion of free cash flow \u2013 Chevron share at $60 Brent \u2013 in 2025.  Chevron's Permian production set another record in the second quarter, about 5% above the previous quarterly high. We expect next quarter's production to be roughly flat before growing again in the fourth quarter, on track with our full-year guidance.  Early 2023 well performance in our company-operated assets, in all three areas, is consistent with our plans. In New Mexico, we've put on production at 10 wells. Before year-end, we expect to POP an additional 30 wells with higher expected production rates. As a reminder, about half of Chevron's Permian production is company operated, with the balance non-operated and royalty production.  While short-term well performance is one measure, we're focused on maximizing value from our unique, large resource base that is expected to deliver decades of high-return production.  Over the next five years, we expect to develop over 2,200 net new wells, growing production while delivering return on capital employed near 30% and free cash flow greater than $5 billion in 2027 at $60 Brent.  Longer term, we've identified well over 6,000 economic net well locations that support a plateau greater than 1 million barrels per day through the end of next decade. Our deep resource inventory and advantaged royalty position allow us to optimize our development plans for high returns, incorporating learnings and technology improvements, as we expect to deliver strong free cash flow for years to come.  In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the floating production unit at Anchor is on location and the project remains on track for first oil next year. We continue to build on our exploration success and were awarded the highest number of blocks in the most recent lease round.  In the Eastern Med, our Aphrodite appraisal well in Cyprus met our expectations and we've submitted a development concept to the government. At Leviathan, we're expanding pipeline capacity to nearly 1.4 BCF per day. We expect to close our acquisition of PDC Energy in August after their shareholder vote next week. Our teams are working on integration plans and we look forward to welcoming PDC's talented employees to Chevron.  Now, over to Pierre. \nPierre Breber: As Mike said, strong, consistent financial performance enabled Chevron to return record cash to shareholders this quarter, while also investing within our CapEx budget and paying down debt.  Working capital lowered cash flow primarily due to true-up tax payments outside the US. Excluding tax payments, working capital movements are variable. Our typical pattern in the second half of the year is to draw down working capital.  Chevron's net debt ratio ended the quarter at 7%, significantly below the low end of our guidance range. Surplus cash on the balance sheet was reduced during the quarter, with cash balances ending at $9.6 billion, well above the cash required to run the company.  Adjusted second quarter earnings were down $5.6 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted Upstream earnings were lower mainly due to realizations, partly offset by higher liftings. Other includes primarily favorable tax items and income from Venezuela non-equity investments.  Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower refining margins. OpEx was up mainly due to higher transportation costs and the inclusion of REG.  Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down $900 million. Adjusted Upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower realizations. This was partially offset by higher production in the US and non-recurring tax benefits. Adjusted Downstream earnings were down modestly, lower margins were partially offset with higher volumes.  Second quarter oil equivalent production was down about 20,000 barrels per day from last quarter, primarily due to planned turnarounds at Gorgon and in the Gulf of Mexico and downtime associated with the Canadian wildfires. This was mostly offset by growth in the Permian.  Now, looking ahead. In the third quarter, we have a planned turnaround at TCO and a planned pitstop at Gorgon, completed earlier this week. Our full-year production outlook is trending near the low end of the annual guidance range.  Since PDC's proxy solicitation on July 7th, we've not been permitted to buy back our shares. After we close the acquisition in August, we plan to resume buybacks at the $17.5 billion annual rate, which we expect to continue through the fourth quarter. We do not expect a dividend from TCO until the fourth quarter. Full-year affiliate dividends are expected to be near the low end of our guidance.  Putting it all together, we delivered another quarter with solid financial results, strong project execution and continued return of cash to shareholders. Our approach is consistent and you can see that in our actions and results.  Back to you, Jake. \nJake Spiering : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open the lines. \nOperator: Our first question comes from John Royall with J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Royall: My first question is on Upstream production. Can you bridge us maybe from the midpoint of your production guidance to the low end that you mentioned in the opening? Sounds like the Permian is on plan. So what pieces have come in below the midpoint of plan to move you to that well end?\nMichael Wirth: Guidance remains unchanged. We expect to be at the lower end of that. And as we said, Permian production has been strong. The things that Pierre mentioned I think are the key things that we've seen. There's been some impact of fires in Canada that have impacted our ability of, not really our operations per se, we did some evacuations on a precautionary basis, but it was midstream and processing downtime that we weren't able to move our production to market.  And the rest of it is \u2013 oh, and Benchamas too, I guess, is the other one. We have an FPSO in Thailand that had an incident and early in the year was taken off station. And so that's another 10,000 or 11,000 barrels a day net, which is off for the foreseeable future. And so, it's really those two things are the ones that are pushing us down that were both unexpected.\nJohn Royall: My next question is just sticking to production, but just drilling in a bit on the Permian. The well results generally look very strong in the first half, but still a bit below 2022 in New Mexico. Maybe you can just update us on what innings you think you're in just in terms of optimizing the single bench developments in New Mexico?\nMichael Wirth: The thing that I think it's important to bear in mind is that New Mexico type curve we showed there, there are only 10 POPs represented or 10 POPs that we achieved all in the second quarter there. So there's no first quarter POPs. And there's only seven that actually had enough data to make it into the curve you see on the chart. So it's a very thin set of data. We expect 30 more POPs in the second half of this year, so that the bulk of the program is not representative of those curve.  And there's a couple of other things, one that the wells we did POP have had some facility constraints that have limited full productivity. So we actually haven't been able to move all the production due to some third party facility constraints that we faced. And the rest of the program is actually in a different part of the New Mexico portion of the Delaware, where we expect higher productivity.  So, it's a combination of things. But I'd caution you not to over-index on a very thin dataset with a lot more data to come in the second half of the year.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: I wanted to just stick with the Permian since we're on that topic. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit just around the mix trend that you're seeing there. And if we disaggregate the productivity a little bit further, you talk about how much of the uplift is coming from gas and NGLS versus oil. And then similarly, as you progress towards your longer term production goals, how you expect the mix in the basin for you to trend oil, gas, NGLs over time.\nMichael Wirth: Devin, we're still drilling primary benches, so we can optimize the oil cut. Across the basin, our production remains roughly 50% oil, 25% NGLs, 25% gas. We look at all the commodities \u2013 oil, NGLs and gas \u2013 and have our own long term views on prices and markets to run the economics to optimize the returns. And the gas/oil ratio in aggregate has been relatively flat for a number of years. And we don't see it changing a lot. It can vary a little bit in different parts of the basin, but if you take it for our whole portfolio, that 50/25/25 remains a pretty good way for you to think about it.\nDevin McDermott: I wanted to shift over to TCO. Good to hear the continued positive progress there as we get closer to the finish line. There's a lot of moving pieces over the next year, year-and-a-half as we get the two phases of development online. You give the guidance for the turnaround impact in 3Q. I was wanting to talk a little bit more about how you see the evolution of production into the fourth quarter of this year and then through 2024, as we get to that 2025 run rate. So, shape it a bit for us as we look out over the next few quarters.\nMichael Wirth: The headline here is no change to cost and schedule. I think that's really important. In the second quarter, we made really good progress. As we said, 98% project completion and commissioning is essentially two-thirds complete. In the second quarter, we achieved mechanical completion of the three GI, gas injection, facilities and got fuel gas into the flare system, which is very important to enable an on-time startup of FTP.  In the quarter that we're in now, the third quarter, we expect full mechanical completion of the Future Growth Project and, also, a turnaround at one of the Komplex Technology Lines, or KTLs, will begin a lot of work and start up on utility systems, boilers, steam system, other utilities that are required for startup of the pressure boost facility, which is the key driver of WPMP, which enables us to convert from high pressure to low pressure across the field.  Once that turnaround is done in the third quarter and you will see some production impact. I think Jared guided to that. We expect to have two of the four big pressure boost compressors online, which allows us to begin the conversion of metering stations from high pressure to low pressure. And that will initiate \u2013 we'll get that started at the end of this year. It'll take 10 to 12 months for all of those conversions to occur. There will be turnarounds next year as well, two more turnarounds, one at SGI and another one in one of the KTLs. And all of that is part of a very carefully choreographed sequencing of turnarounds and startup activity that will bring the full field, so the 1 million barrels a day for 2025.  So, as we indicated at our Investor Day, what you're going to see in 2023 and 2024 is the normal turnaround activity interlaced with all of this project startup activity. This is not as simple as bringing on a new portion of the field. We're really reworking the entire gathering and producing capacity of the field. And so, it's quite a complex series of activities to execute all of that. And so, the production reflects that. And we put, I think, a chart to kind of give you some guidance for both this year and next year.\nJake Spiering: Slide 10 from our set has annual production, 2023, 2024, 2025. Yeah, no change in that guidance. \nOperator: We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: I want to stay on TCO. And while there will be a volume inflection in 2025, there's probably going to be a free cash flow inflection in 2024, just as affiliate CapEx rolls off first. And so, can you talk about the cadence of that and how it manifests itself in terms of dividends?\nPierre Breber: Yeah, we've been guiding \u2013 Neil, this is Pierre \u2013 to the clean year because that's the $5 billion of free cash flow, $60 Brent in 2025. And, of course, we're guiding to free cash flow, because as you recall, it's not just dividends, it's also repayment of the loans and the co-lending that we have done along the way. And the profile of those loans are disclosed in our SEC filings.  Exactly to your point, you'll see a build towards that just as the CapEx has rolled off. It was not that long ago we were investing $3 billion to $4 billion a year our share into the project and that's down to $1.5 billion or so this year and will continue to trend down. So there's that inflection point.  What's also being managed, of course, are commodity prices and those vary. And as we've said, TCO continues to be conservative in managing its balance sheet, so it's been holding more cash on the balance sheet. As the project gets closer to the end, as we've demonstrated that TPC is running very reliably now for almost a year-and-a-half, we expect some of that cash to come on.  So I can't get in front of the board of directors of TCO. It's a separate company that we are a shareholder in. But we expect, as we said, a much bigger dividend in the fourth quarter than we saw in 2Q. And we expect to see a release of some of that surplus cash that's been held on the balance sheet. And that'll continue over the next couple of years as we head into that $5 billion of free cash flow in 2025.  And maybe the last thing, Neil, you know that TCO has really good price sensitivity. So I've seen yours and other estimates, at 70% or 80%, the cash flow is even stronger.\nNeil Mehta: The follow-up is just on the return of capital. I think while you have a big buyback range, a lot of market participants have kind of viewed your $17.5 billion dollars as the P50 outcome in any reasonable commodity price environment. And so, thinking less of it like a flywheel and more as sort of a relatively fixed number unless commodity prices go wacky. Just any thoughts on that statement and whether you're trying to give us a little bit more surety around that number as opposed to a more volatile number.\nPierre Breber: The range, Neil, is tied to the upside/downside cases that we showed at our Investor Day, roughly, right? So, there's $10 billion to $20 billion. So you're right. It's a wide range because it reflects a wide range of prices between that upside case and the downside case. And of course, in between, there's a sort of a mid-cycle case. And as a reminder, that downside case gets to $50 in a couple of years and stays there for three years. So that is a real downside case. And that's what the low end of the buyback range is notionally tied to.  The upside case is a case that's not too different from what we're seeing now. It averages about $85 over the five year period. It trends down to $70 towards the end of that period. And that's why you're seeing a buyback very close to the top end of the range at the $17.5 billion dollars. So it's certainly a signal that, as we look out over this commodity cycle, and again, we think of the buybacks as being steady across a cycle that we feel good about it. So we said we could do a much larger buyback, but that would be not steady, and we don't want to be procyclical. We're trying to be across the cycle. And so, yes, when we guide on buybacks, we're guiding with the intent of maintaining it for a number of years across the cycle.\nMichael Wirth: Neil, I would just add, you see in our second quarter results that our net debt remains very, very low. And we've indicated multiple times that we don't have a problem gearing back up and putting more debt on the balance sheet to get back towards the range that we've guided to through the cycle in order to sustain a very steady share repurchase program.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steven Richardson with Evercore ISI. \nStephen Richardson: Mike, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about new energies. I think you've been clear from the beginning that build versus buy was part of the consideration in a lot of these businesses. We saw a big CO2 pipeline and EUR company transact recently. So maybe you can talk a little bit about the CCUS business as you view it and why build versus buy is maybe the better choice for Chevron?  Maybe I should get ahead of it with a follow up as maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on Bayou Bend please?\nMichael Wirth: I'll put those two together actually. Look, we'll do both build and buy, I think, in new energies. I would fully expect us to do that in renewable fuels. We have built a business, but then we also went out and acquired Renewable Energy Group. So I think you'll see both.  Certainly, the Denbury transaction is one that the market somewhat anticipated. And you can presume that multiple market players probably took a look at or had conversations with Denbury.  For us, in CCUS, we look for areas that have good geology or pore space, they're near concentrated emissions and have the right policy support to enable a business. The Gulf Coast has all of these things. And Bayou Bend, we've got about 140,000 acres of permanent CO2 pore space, both onshore and offshore. We've got storage potential there of greater than 1 billion metric tons. In the second half of this year, we're going to drill a strat well in the offshore acreage to further delineate and characterize the subsurface. In the first part of next year, we expect to drill a strat well in the onshore acreage and do the same.  And of course, we're in conversations with a number of customers in that region in the Golden Triangle, up at Mont Belvieu, all the way across the Houston Ship Channel. And we've got term sheets going back and forth. We're in negotiations with a number of different potential customers. The commercial framework for this is still evolving. And we're working on the other pieces you need. So classics, well injection permits. And midstream assets, we've got an RFP out right now, with a number of midstream providers, consistent with the way we have generally approached the midstream. We own assets if they're strategic. If there's a way for us to go to somebody who's in the business of building and operating midstream infrastructure, we certainly look at that as well. So we're putting all the pieces together there for a phased development. We like the Bayou Bend project. And we'll report more. But to your kind of underlying question, we'll build organically and we'll do inorganic, where it makes sense.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: My first one is on portfolio concentration. So at your Analyst Day, you talked about just over $20 billion of free cash flow at $60 a barrel. And looking through today's slides, roughly half of that in the medium term will come from the Permian plus TCO. So I understand that you want every dollar to go to the highest level of return, which is completely sensible. But I was wondering if you can talk about portfolio concentration because it is quite unusual for a super major to have that level of concentration in terms of free cash flow. So how do you think about portfolio diversity? And is this something you're actively trying to address going forward? And I've got a follow-up on a different topic. \nMichael Wirth: Biraj, if you look back over the last decade, we've cleaned up our portfolio. We had a lot of assets that were kind of at the smaller end of the tail that pulled capital and management time and resources. And we want to be diversified. We've got a diverse portfolio. But we don't need to be diversified just for the sake of it. We want to have assets that have scale, that are material and long lived. You can start in the Far East and look at our LNG positions in Australia, which aren't drawing a lot of capital right now, but are [Technical Difficulty] acquisition in the EG assets that can feed LNG into Europe.  Obviously, you mentioned TCO. The Eastern Med is a very strong position. We've recently taken FID and are working on expansion projects for tomorrow, Leviathan, and have submitted a concept on Aphrodite. So there's a lot of opportunity in that asset.  When we close PDC, we're going to be producing 400,000 barrels a day in the DJ Basin. We've talked about some of our other shale and tight assets in Argentina, in Canada. We've got two crackers underway in CPChem that will come online middle of this decade, one in the US, one in the Middle East. We've acquired REG and are growing our renewable fuels business.  So we have exposure across a large portfolio. And then, of course, we also have projects coming online in the Gulf of Mexico. I mentioned Anchor earlier, Whale, Ballymore. And we recently acquired more leases in this recent lease sale than the \u2013 twice as many leases as in the biggest lease sale over the last eight years. So we're adding to our position in the Gulf of Mexico.  So this idea that we're a two asset company, the Permian and TCO, I don't think really stands up to careful inspection. They're two great assets, and so they get a lot of attention, but we've got a lot of other strong assets in our portfolio.\nPierre Breber: If I can just build off that and go to the return of capital question that Neil asked and that's what gives us confidence not only on the buyback, but on the track record of dividend growth. So, we guided to 10% annual free cash flow coming from all those businesses. Some are holding cash constant, some are growing cash flow that Mike covered. And that goes to leading dividend growth where we've grown the dividend over the last five years at rates double our closest peer and much higher than others, and where we have a buyback that is nearly 6% of our shares outstanding annually. Our business is built for $50. So part of the confidence in our ability \u2013 currently, if you look at our breakeven and adjust for working capital this quarter, if you look at the last four quarters, it's actually probably a little bit lower than that with the strong refining margins that we've been seeing. So we're built for lower prices. Free cash flow is going to grow from this base. That should give investors confidence in our ability to continue to grow the dividend at leading rates and to maintain buybacks at also very high rates. \nBiraj Borkhataria: Just following up on a different question. Through the Permian, you'll be producing a lot more gas over time and you have expressed a desire to grow in LNG. So, you've signed a couple of deals as an offtaker to synthetically integrate your US gas position to global markets. I wanted to ask about the sort of \u2013 whether you'd be interested in owning liquefaction or whether you feel being an offtaker is enough because some of your peers have argued the benefits of integration and owning through the value chain. But I think in the past, you've noticed the returns are typically lower. And I'm particularly interested in asking that question now because a number of players have signed offtake agreements with companies such as Venture Global, and then actually they're not receiving the gas as agreed. So it's interesting how you're thinking about that sort of value chain in LNG. \nMichael Wirth: It's consistent with what we've described earlier, and I think you've captured it. It depends on the circumstance. In places where you've got remote gas where you need to be in the entire value chain and you can create an economic model that supports the investments, we've done that. In other locations where you've got other people that will put capital into the midstream assets, we can sell gas into that, we can offtake gas off of it, but not participate in some of the very capital intensive and lower return portions of the value chain. That's certainly a model that helps us support our aspiration to drive higher returns.  Now you have to have good partners, you have to have reliable operations, and we'll work closely with the companies that we have offtake with. We vet them carefully and we have confidence in the people that we are working with to provide those reliable operations, but we're really looking to drive high returns, not necessarily to own assets for the sake of control unless it creates a differentiated value proposition. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: The question is on the cash balance. It looks like, nominally, it's drawn down, but it feels there's some inputs that would theoretically help it rebuild in the second half. You've got working capital and I think TCO is going to pay a dividend in third quarter. And PDC had a very front loaded capital program too. So, that's coming on with free cash flow. So just wondering about the cash balance and how you think about the level or if we're going to be in a rebuild phase for 2H? \nPierre Breber: Well, the direction that it goes depends, of course, on commodity prices and margins and a number of other factors. You're right, our cash levels have come down, in part due to working capital outflows, timing of affiliate dividends. And we've also paid down some debt. We've been, I think, very clear that we don't want to hold surplus cash, certainly not permanently, that it's where the cash goes in the short term. But, over time, that cash is going to be returned to our shareholders in the form of this growing dividend and ratable buyback program. So we need only about $5 billion to support our operations. We're nearly $10 billion at the end of the second quarter. So that's more than sufficient. We have access to lots of liquidity. We don't have any commercial paper now. Again, we've been paying down debt. So that's the more economically efficient way to manage the balance sheet if we get there. And whether the balance the cash balance goes up or down again depends on all the inputs and outputs that we've been showing.  We're guiding towards the net debt, as Mike said. The net debt is well below the low end of our guidance range. So, we look at all those factors. And again, if cash balances head down to $5 billion, that'll be adequate to cover the operations.  On working capital, our pattern the second half of the year is that we tend to see some draws on it. But we're certainly not going to recover from what we've seen this first half of the year. A big portion of what we saw in the first half of this year on working capital are really tax payments tied to earnings last year. So you can kind of think of those as being offset from last year where we had that favorable working capital environment.  So, there'll be ups and downs along the way. Over time, working capital tends to average out over zero. But these are just timing effects. We look through them. We knew we had taxes due. And so, that's all part of the planning as we look at the balance sheet. \nJake Spiering: Sam, I guess that we've guided to a TCO dividend in the fourth quarter. We do not expect a dividend in the third quarter.\nSam Margolin: Sorry, I must have misread that remark. The follow up is actually sort of on the organization. It's a follow-up to Steve's question earlier. But Pierre had spent some time in an ESG role and the low carbon role. And the incoming CFO is coming from a role where there was a lot of work on the ground on the low carbon front, on the technology side. And so, Chevron has this really interesting sort of marriage between finance and low carbon that I think is differentiated when you look at some of the peers. And so, the question is, as we make progress through the low carbon development, do you feel like you're embedded in the highest return areas? Or are there other ones where capital is going to maybe pivot? And I think that ties into carbon capture too because that seems like a place where the incentives are pretty transparent? \nMichael Wirth: I think your question started with people and ended up at our kind of investment priorities in new energies. Look, across the entire leadership team, we've got a commitment to driving higher returns and lower carbon, and people move through different kinds of roles. But this is part of every role in the company today. So, it's a part of the business, it's something we're committed to.  Our focus is, as we've said before, it's on things where we can leverage our unique capabilities, assets, value chains, customers, to create sustainable, competitive advantage in these new energy businesses. It's why we've not gone into wind and solar on a merchant basis because there's others that can do that and we don't want to really bring anything unique there.  Our renewable fuels business today is profitable and generating cash. We expect to start up the Geismar expansion and be producing more renewable diesel next year. So, that's a business today that is economic and attractive, and we continue to grow, particularly back into the feedstock side. We announced an acquisition this last quarter of a small company that's got some interesting feedstock technology. Carbon capture and storage, obviously, is being built. We do it today in some assets. But as a business, we're building out Bayou Bend. I talked about, we're working on projects in other parts of the world as well. And we do believe that, with the right technology, the right business model and policy environments that there is an opportunity there.  Other things that we're working on, hydrogen is one that's both electrolytic hydrogen and then traditional hydrogen paired with carbon capture and storage. In the US, the IRA incentives can certainly support the development of business models there.  So I think we'll stay consistent with this. We're always looking at new technologies, but the area we focused on is the primary area you should expect to see us investing.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. \nJason Gabelman: I'd like to go back to the Permian detail for a minute, if I could, and kind of two questions on this. First, has CapEx in the Permian deviated at all from that $4 billion budget that you highlighted at the Analyst Day.  And the second part, on the Permian inventory over the five year plan and long term, what percentage of those locations would you categorize as tier one? \nMichael Wirth: Jason, Permian CapEx is up a little bit this year. Primarily three things. Number one, we've actually seen our drilling performance continue to improve and completions performance continue to improve. So out of the same fleet of rigs and completion spreads, we're getting more work done, which means you consume more tubulars, more sands, more water, et cetera. So, that's kind of a good thing.  We're seeing some longer lead times on some of the critical elements in facilities. And so, we've actually had to make some long lead purchases for next year's program that we didn't anticipate as we were lining up this year's program. And then, we've increased facility scope for water handling in some areas of the Permian, particularly as we're trying to manage some of these induced seismicity issues. We're being more and more careful removing more water. And so, that has all led to some increase in CapEx. Not a lot of inflation there. The inflation has been largely in line with what we had expected and the rig fleet is being activated in line with what we expected.  Your second question on inventory, we haven't broken our portfolio into tiers. There's not a very clear definition of that and a way to kind of do that on a standard basis. So when we've outlined the drilling locations and the long term guidance there, it's really based on economics. And we've got locations that are economic at our price view for the future, which has historically not been a super aggressive price view. It's based on today's technology. And as indicated, we've got more than 6,000 locations in that outer time window that are economic based on those assumptions. By the time we get to that window, we may or may not see a different price environment. I fully expect we'll see a different technology environment, which can allow that number to grow even further.  So we look at it more in terms of the economics of the development than tiers.\nJason Gabelman: My follow-up, just going back to TCO, you made some comments on kind of maintenance effects over the next four quarters. And I know you showed it graphically, but are you able to quantify the actual impact to our production over the next four quarters from all these turnarounds and startup activities?\nPierre Breber: Jason, we do it quarterly. Like, it's included in the third quarter guidance that we provided. And we'll continue to do that quarterly and you're seeing sort of annually. We're giving annual guidance on TCO. So it's all embedded in there. I think we showed it relative to 2022. But there's just a lot of moving parts. But we'll continue to give that guidance each quarter and you have annual guidance that incorporates all of that. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nIrene Himona: My first question is on the Downstream, please, if you can talk around the performance of your chemicals affiliates, in particular in Q2 and then what you're seeing so far in the third quarter. And then, also what you would expect in terms of refining margin evolution in the second half of the year, given the weakness in Q2.\nMichael Wirth: The chemicals business is cyclical, as everybody knows. We're certainly in a period now where we're seeing some length in supply due to newbuild facilities. There's some length there that's weighed on margins in the olefins chain. And in the short term, we think we're going to continue to see that be a pretty tough sector. Longer term, as you get out to mid-decade and beyond, demand will continue to grow. And we expect demand and supply will come into better balance, and we'll see those margins recover out towards the middle and second part of this this decade.  Your second question, I'm sorry I was thinking about chemicals there. Refining margins, yeah. Certainly, we've seen refining margins come off the very strong levels that they were at last year. There's been some new capacity come into the system around the world, some big new refineries that have begun to start up or major projects that have come online, and so margins have softened year-on-year.  Certainly, the West Coast in our portfolio is important. West Coast margins, both in the refining and the marketing part of the value chain, have held up a little bit better because it's a market that is a little bit more cut off from the rest of the world than the Gulf Coast or Asia. And so, demand continues to be pretty strong out there.  Our gasoline demand is strong. Jet demand continues to come back. Diesel demand has maybe flattened out a little bit, but certainly holding. And so, we're in an environment where I would expect inventories towards the lower end of the products in a number of parts of the world. I think refining margins for the second half of this year are likely to be as good as they were in the first half of the year at least.\nIrene Himona: Based on that, following your FID for the pipeline in Israel, I was wondering, is that it for the time being for Leviathan? Or do the partners continue to examine other options like FLNG, for example? \nMichael Wirth: Yes, we continue to evaluate other options. In fact, we're working towards a concept select for the next expansion of Leviathan, ideally, at the end of this year, and floating LNG is one of the concepts that we continue to look at.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Maybe if I could follow up on some earlier Permian conversations. You talked a little bit about some of the New Mexico well performance. But on well performance overall that you disclosed, it appears that first half results are showing improved performance across much of the basin, as you expected. What have you seen to date in terms of addressing some \u2013 I know you don't have a lot of data, but in terms of addressing some of the concerns from last year? Particularly, what have you learned regarding spacing, single versus multi bench approach, et cetera, on the wells that you've done so far this year?\nMichael Wirth: The performance is really consistent with our expectations and what we outlined at our Investor Day earlier this year, Ryan. There are a couple of things just to remember. I mentioned earlier that, in New Mexico, we saw some infrastructure and third party constraints, and you can have that \u2013 we've got that in some other parts of our portfolio as well. So there are things that will show up on these curves that are not necessarily \u2013 just a reflection of the geology and the well performance.  And as we continue to change our development strategy on well spacing, profit loading, well length, et cetera, those will continue to be reflected in these curves. The thing that is really important is production \u2013 we put production out there because everybody likes to see it. We're not optimizing the production. We're optimizing the returns. And so, fluid mix, EUR, capital investments are all important parts of what we're optimizing to. It's harder for you to see all the things that we're looking to optimize to drive returns when you're just looking at production.  The high level answer is performance in line with the expectations as we've continued to evolve our program.\nRyan Todd: Maybe if we turn to the Gulf of Mexico, as we think about your Gulf of Mexico deepwater portfolio, you've got an impressive string of project startups coming over the next few years. How exposed are you to escalating trends in deepwater drilling and development costs? As you look across those projects, do you have costs locked in across some of those projects, rigs under multi-year contracts, et cetera? I guess, how much are you able to mitigate cost escalation as we think over kind of CapEx requirements over the next few years? \nPierre Breber: Yeah, those projects were contracted at a different time. So they reflect mostly locked in rates, as you'd expect. Procurements well behind us as we're getting \u2013 as projects are pretty far along. So new exploration activities, we'll get exposed to some of the higher rig rates on that, but for the existing major capital projects, that's largely locked in.\nMichael Wirth: We came into the year with three rigs under contracts that were contracted back in a different environment. \nOperator: We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Maybe two questions, if I could. One, you're talking about you submit a development plan in Cyprus discovery? Can you give us a little bit in terms of the timeline? What should we expect? And also, what is the preliminary design of the development that's going to look like and the scale? And what kind of time that it's going to see the first oil?  The second question that you haven't talked much about, Argentina. And, over there, the government seems to be pretty excited with shale oil development. And you have a position there. Can you give us an update? What is your thinking over there?\nMichael Wirth: Paul, in Cyprus, we're pleased with the outcome of the recent appraisal well. We've submitted our development plan to the government for their approval and it involves a capital efficient way to take the gas to market via subsea tiebacks to existing infrastructure. But this is all pending government approval. If we get that, we could be into FEED later this year. But it's a little early for us to really lay anything out on first gas. So as we get through the government approval process, we'll get back to talk to you about the timeline on that one.  On Argentina, we remain very positive on the resource there. There's an election coming up. The country's got its some kind of macroeconomic challenges that it's facing right now. But we like the block, particularly our El Trapial area where we're doing some more development work now with some increased capital that flows with that. We'll talk to you about that at Investor Day and beyond. But no real changes there. It's going to be part of the growth story. \nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: My first question is on the Permian ratability. It looks like you've got about a couple of hundreds POPs this, wells to sales. 2,000 over the next five years. Is that ratable? How should we think about the step up in activity?\nPierre Breber: Just one thing, the coop POPs is 200. But if you were to include net POPs, again, half of our portfolio is non-op and royalty, it'd be more like 300. So it looks more consistent. The long term plateau in the well inventory, the 2,200 over the next five years, incorporates all of the activity and the POP data was just on company operated. So there is some increase, but not as large as it looks. You've just get it apples to apples.\nDoug Leggate: They're fairly ratable, Pierre? Like, 500 a year type of deal or 400 a year type of deal.\nPierre Breber: As we get up to activity, and as Mike said, we're becoming more efficient as are other operators that we work with. Yeah, it's going to be pretty ratable once we get up to our full rate activity. \nMichael Wirth: Of course, Doug, quarter to quarter, there's some variability as we saw first quarter to second quarter this year. The third quarter is going to be a little \u2013 so there can be some surges and plateaus quarter to quarter, but on an annual basis, yeah, it's going to be pretty ratable.\nDoug Leggate: My follow-up, guys, is on Tengiz, but it's a slightly different question. I guess Pierre and I are similar vintage, the same Tengiz in 1993. It expires six years after the end of your Analyst Day trajectory through 2027 and it's a quarter of your free cash flow. So, my question is, what are your options there, whether it be extended or replaced? And perhaps maybe some color on what the production profile looks like post 2027 [indiscernible] going into fairly severe decline after 2030? So, just want to know what you're thinking about the long term sustainability of those free cash flows?\nMichael Wirth: The concession is a decade away. We're focused on delivering the project right now. This is a big, complex asset, a big, complex project. We'll certainly be in discussions with the government over time about potential extension of this. It'll reflect what we see in terms of reservoir performance and production opportunities out into the future. These concession discussions have to create value for the country and for Chevron. So we've got to find something that works for both parties. We've walked away from concessions, as you've covered extensively, Doug, where it didn't work for us, in places like Indonesia and Thailand. We've extended in places like Angola where it did. So we'll be talking more about that over time. But, right now, we're really focused on project execution and delivering FTP.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: I guess my first question for you, with the extension of your tenure, are you willing to share with us what some of the things you're hoping to get done and the extra time will be, or maybe what some of the real opportunities are here that you'd like to shepherd through? \nMichael Wirth: Roger, it's been a pretty turbulent first part of my tenure with a major restructuring, a pandemic and oil prices that collapsed, a war and oil prices that spiked, the political and geopolitical noise that comes with those things, the ongoing climate and ESG issues, three acquisitions, one of which we still haven't closed. And so, I'm actually looking forward to a little smoother water, I hope one day.  And, look, we still got work to do to continue to drive higher returns and lower carbon. And so, it's to continue that work. We've got good momentum in our business. We've delivered strong results through all of that turbulence and have maintained strong shareholder distributions throughout and strategic consistency throughout where we've seen others in the industry buffeted around a little bit by these horses. And so, I'd like to continue that and to drive more value to our shareholders and higher returns and lower carbon.\nRoger Read: I commend you for not trying to duck out when things finally look good for at least a short time. My follow-up question is really much more on the modeling front. If we look at your realizations on oil, they were much stronger here in the second quarter. I think that contributed to some of the outperformance. But what we really saw was a dip Q1 and an improvement Q2, kind of back in line with traditional. So, I was just wondering, as we think about \u2013 was that a timing issue, a regional issue, first quarter, and anything we should be thinking about as we look at your realization or capture on oil prices going forward?\nPierre Breber: Roger, our view that \u2013 not quite picked that up. So why don't you follow up with Jake after the call and make sure we understand your question, and we'll do our best take on it. But our oil realizations have looked good and our natural gas realizations have looked strong. We had better timing in the first quarter. So if you look quarter-on-quarter on some of our international gas, it might seem a little weaker, but not sure on liquid. So, please follow up with Jake.\nJake Spiering: I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation in today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Chevron second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-04-28 15:28:02", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering, please go ahead.\nJake Spiering : Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call and webcast. I\u2019m Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron\u2019s website Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMike Wirth : Chevron delivered strong financial results again last quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter with return on capital employed greater than 12%. This enabled another record for cash returned to shareholders while maintaining a very strong balance sheet. Since our investor day two months ago, we\u2019ve remained focused on executing our plans. Achieving important milestones on our major project in Kazakhstan, continuing to build activity levels in the Permian, positioning Bayou Bend to be one of the largest carbon storage projects in the United States, and safely and reliably delivering oil, products and natural gas that help power the global economy. Next week, we\u2019ll publish our Corporate Sustainability Report. I encourage you to review it on our website as we provide updates on the ESG topics that matter to our business and our stakeholders. In closing, while commodity markets remain uncertain, our approach is unchanged: capital and cost discipline applied to advantaged assets in both traditional and new energy businesses and steady returns of cash to shareholders. You can see that consistency in our actions and our results. Now to Pierre to discuss the quarter.\nPierre Breber : Thanks, Mike. We reported first quarter earnings of $6.6 billion, or $3.46 per share. Adjusted earnings were $6.7 billion, or $3.55 per share. We had one special item this quarter related to changes in the energy profits tax in the United Kingdom. The appendix of this presentation contains a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Strong operating cash flow enabled Chevron to deliver on its financial priorities during the quarter a 6% per share dividend increase, higher CapEx within budget, net debt ratio under 5%, share repurchases at the top of our prior guidance range. Adjusted first quarter earnings were up over $200 million versus last year despite 20% lower oil prices. Adjusted Upstream earnings were lower mainly due to realizations and adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily due to higher refining margins. Both segments benefitted from a change in timing effects. Higher interest income and lower accruals for stock-based compensation decreased all other charges.  Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down $1.1 billion. Adjusted Upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower realizations. Other items include the absence of last quarter\u2019s dividend withholding tax at TCO and lower exploration and transportation expenses. Adjusted Downstream earnings were essentially flat. Lower margins and volumes were offset with higher chemical earnings and other favorable items including trading results. Lower accruals for incentive-based compensation decreased All Other net charges and also benefitted the operating segments  First quarter oil equivalent production was down about 80,000 barrels per day from last year due to the expiration of a contract in Thailand and the sale of our Eagle Ford asset. This was partially offset by growth in the Permian. We expect 2023 production growth in the Permian to be back-end loaded as wells put on production, POPs increase across both operated and non-operated areas. We expect our royalty production to be roughly flat. As discussed during our Investor Day, we\u2019re increasing activity in New Mexico. All four company-operated rigs added this year, one each quarter, will be in New Mexico, leading to more POPs expected in the second half of the year and into 2024. We also continue to be active in Texas. Last year, about half of our company-operated production was in the Delaware Basin in Texas with the remainder split about evenly between the Midland Basin and New Mexico. More than half of our non-operated production is with five major operators in large, contiguous positions in core areas with multiyear development programs, where we have visibility to capex and execution schedules and a royalty benefit compared to the operator. The balance is with dozens of other operators where we have a little less visibility, but similar predictability from greater diversification. More than half of our royalty production comes from the Pecos River area in the heart of the Delaware Basin. The balance of our royalty position is in the remainder of the Delaware and Midland Basins, also with well-known operators.  In summary, Chevron has a large, diverse position in the Permian with a unique royalty advantage where we learn from our own operations and from others. Now, looking ahead. In the second quarter, we expect planned turnarounds at Gorgon and in the Gulf of Mexico along with downtime at a FSO in Thailand and a number of planned refinery turnarounds. Also, we expect share buybacks to increase to a $17.5 billion annual rate. In summary, 1Q was another quarter with strong financial results, continued capital discipline, and a steady return of cash to shareholders. We\u2019re confident that consistent and straightforward management, through commodity cycles, will create value for stakeholders. Back to you, Jake.\nJake Spiering : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all your questions answered.  Katie, please open the lines. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nJake Spiering : Good morning, Devin. \nDevin McDermott: Good morning. So there were some helpful detail in the slides and the remarks on the breakdown of permeant operations. If I look at the quarter, your volumes did fall a bit sequentially in 1Q versus 4Q. I wonder if you could just talk in a bit more detail about some of the drivers there, how things are going as you ramp New Mexico activity. And that's typically the confidence that you have in that back-half weighted production ramp.\nMike Wirth : Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Devin. Pierre tried to show a little more detail, including breaking out COOP JV, royalty, talking about drilling activity and feed drilled et cetera. So glad that that was helpful.  First quarter performance was a function of really the fact that NOJV and royalty production, which as you can see from that chart is, a meaningful portion of our overall production, was down a little bit from fourth quarter of last year. Now, this gets a little a little lumpy due to how it gets reported by partners. And so, over time, it's trended up, particularly the NOJV piece. But it was a little lumpy, and it was down first quarter versus fourth quarter last year,  COOP production was mostly flat from 4Q of last year to first quarter this year. In terms of the full year outlook, on Slide 9, we show full year outlook, it's about 770,000 barrels a day. '22 was a little bit over 700 -- 707, I think, Our COOP production will grow in the mid-single digits. NOJV, we expect to grow in the mid-teens, and royalty is roughly flat year-on-year as our expectation. So that kind of lays out first quarter and we still think that the guide would give us appropriate as Pierre said, back-end loaded. So, we'll be updating each quarter on that.\nDevin McDermott: Got it makes sense. Thanks. And my follow up is on TCO. And it's exciting that we're now less than a year away from startup there and back at the Investor Day, you noticed that you had shifted to commissioning and the startup work for WPMP. I was wondering if you just give us an update on how things are going their latest expectations on timing. And then also the key milestones that we should be keeping an eye out for the balance of this year ahead of startup.\nMike Wirth : Yeah, absolutely. I actually was in Kazakhstan earlier this month. I had a chance to meet with the President of the Republic, some other senior officials, And also spent time down at Tengiz and visited the job site, talk to both people from our construction team, people from the commissioning team, people from operations as we're preparing for startup. And I'll tell you, it looks a little less like a construction site a little bit more like a plant than it did the last time I was down there. So the progress is very obvious. The headline I'll give you is there's no change to our cost or schedule guidance. We expect WPMP startup to begin by the end of this year. Now that's a conversion of the field from high pressure to low pressure. So that will take some time as we take all the metering stations and field infrastructure down to low pressure, but that will still begin by the end of this year. And the startup of the future growth projects, the portion that adds 260,000 barrels of oil production that will begin by mid next year. Both of these require a series of turnarounds and tie-ins and things like that. So it's quite a quite a complex set of activities to get us to the point where we've got everything online.  But there's a lot of work behind us. While I was there, we achieved mechanical completion on the third-generation sour gas injection facility, which was ahead of schedule. And there were a number of milestones that I mentioned that we talked about at the Investor Day that that we've achieved. So we completed tie-in of the fuel gas system so the first gas turbine generator we fired that generator so we know that it's working. In the second quarter in terms of milestones to watch for, we're working to commission boilers, steam system, other utilities that are required for the startup of the pressure boost facility, which is the key driver of that conversion from high pressure to low pressure field operations to enable sustained well deliverability.  In the third quarter, we expect mechanical completion of the future growth project. And then, as I said, will begin startup activities on the field conversion to low pressure by the end of this year. So those are some of the key milestones. And, like I say, a lot behind us, but there's still a lot of complex work ahead. We'll be updating you on it every quarter. \nDevin McDermott: Good to hear. Thanks, Mike.\nMike Wirth : All right, Devin. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. .\nNeil Mehta : Yeah, thank you so much, Mike and Pierre. The first question is just around the LNG portfolio, a lot of volatility in the global gas markets over the course of the last year, just be curious how you guys are seeing the outlook and any updates on your portfolio, particularly down in Australia, where recognized you're going to take into maintenance, but seems like it's operating pretty well.\nMike Wirth : Sure. So -- overall, it's been a bit of a wild ride in gas markets over the last year. And we've seen prices are extraordinarily strong. If you go back two years ago, they were extraordinarily weak. And they've certainly moderated now, as we've had warmer weather in the northern hemisphere, through the wintertime, as the situation in Europe has, I think become a little more stable. Certainly, inventories both in Europe and in the U.S. are much healthier than people were concerned about it at one point in time.  And so, we're into a market that still is perhaps strong by historic standards, but certainly not nearly as strong as what we saw.  Operations that Gorgon and Wheatstone are running very well. We had a record number of LNG cargoes go out of Australia last year. It was 10% better than the best year we've ever had. Reliability was first quartile for the two facilities. And so we feel good about that. We've started -- or this year, we'll start the second turnaround cycle, which is a four-year cycle to turn trains around Gorgon Train 1 will have a major planned turnaround in the second quarter of this year. And the course, we're working on the next stage of field development to continue to keep the field full with wells drilled and in startup activity, time activity, et cetera underway, on the next phase of the gas developments to bring that into the facility.  So things in Australia are good from an operational standpoint and a reliability standpoint. More broadly speaking, we continue to look at opportunities in our LNG portfolio beyond Australia. Certainly, we've talked at some length about the Eastern ramp. So belabor that, but looking at concepts and expect to select a concept on the Leviathan expansion, by the end of this year. And an Equatorial Guinea we're looking at opportunities to bring additional gas resources in through existing infrastructure.  So continue to be very focused on what we can do to add value in our LNG business, but to do it in a way that's returns accretive.\nNeil Mehta : That's great. And then the follow up is, is just on return of capital. And I think you guys have been pretty clear about the range that we should be thinking about from a buyback perspective. Just on dividend growth, just talk about how do you expect that to track relative to your free cash flow per share expectations?\nMike Wirth : Yeah, I think we have been clear on buybacks, so I won't spend time on that. On dividends, I would say our track record should speak for itself. Of course, these are decisions that are made by the board each year, but we've got 30 -- 36 consecutive years now of higher payouts over the last five years. Our dividend growth per share has been double that of our closest peers. So we've sustained this not over the long haul, but also in the short term through the volatile period of time that we've seen. Our dividend track record, I think stands very well. Reiterate our four financial priorities, the first of which is to sustain and grow the dividend, as I just mentioned, 6% increase earlier this year in a compound annual growth rate of 6% over the last 15 years. So, I think -- again, I'll say our track record on the dividends speaks for itself.  I think Pierre mentioned that the quarter we just closed included the highest ever cash distributions to shareholders for the fourth consecutive quarter that we can that, and we're very mindful of, continuing to deliver cash in a in a predictable and consistent manner back to shareholders through both of those vehicles.\nNeil Mehta : Yep. Thanks, Mike.\nMike Wirth : Okay, Neil, thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yeah, thank you. Good morning. Maybe come back to the Permian a little bit. I know you've been providing us a lot more detail on things. And I appreciate that detail for the overall production breakdown in the U.S.  But looking at the Permian, the Chevron operated portion versus your JV non-op, is we think about some of the snags that have been hit over the last couple of quarters, where have been the biggest problems? Is it been in the operated or the non-operated? And then as you think about correcting those over the next couple of quarters, how much of that is Chevron-controlled versus partner?\nMike Wirth : Yeah. So I will speak to our operated operation, because I really can't speak on behalf of the others. They should speak on behalf of their operations. We certainly learned from those. But, we spent a pretty good amount of time at the Investor Day, talking about the learnings on a drill been uncompleted wells that had sat for a long time talking about the prior basis of design for the wells, including spacing and profit loading, talking about multi-venture development.  And we've learned a lot from our own operations, and those learnings are augmented by the things that we learned from others. And so we talked about more single bench development, more activity. In New Mexico, we continue to be very focused on driving strong returns, and not optimizing to production or some other ther metric.  Just to give you a little bit more guidance, Roger for this year, in terms of how to think about it. We expect royalty production to be roughly flat, in the neighborhood of, a little bit over 100,000, maybe 110,000 barrels a day. Most of that comes from the Pecos River area where we've got big operators, Oxy's largest operator in that area, but others that are well known operators in that area. And then we've got some that comes in from the Midland as well from big operators where there's a lot of visibility into what their plans are. Our COOP production growth, we expect to be mid-single digits for the full year. Maybe a touch higher than the midpoint of single digits and expect roughly 190 wells to be put on production this year, which is down a little bit from last year, maybe 10% from last year when our COOP production increased 35,000 barrels a day. We've got growth in the Texas side of the Delaware earlier in the year, the New Mexico side, later in the year, which follows the chart Pierre showed you with drilling lateral feet.  And then in the NOJV, the growth is higher. It's in the mid-teens for the full year. The gross number of POPs in our NOJVs are expected to be up about 15% year-on-year. And it's interesting, our net POPs actually increased more than the gross because we have relatively high working interest and a significant royalty advantage in the non-ops.  And so a 15% increase in gross POPs actually translates into more production than you might presume. We've got really good visibility into the execution schedule we've received more than three quarters of the AFEs for this year's activity. And operations have actually begun on more than three quarters of the NOJV wells that we expect to be popped this year. So it's a mix. We've got a really strong, but also a bit of a complex portfolio because of these three different contributors and we're continuing to hold the guidance, as I said earlier, at about 770 for full year.\nRoger Read: No, that's great. I appreciate that. And a follow-up question, I suspect, is for you, Pierre. Working capital, obviously tends to be a draw in Q1. You've got the sounds like a decent level of planned maintenance in Q2. So just any thoughts on how we should look at overall cash flow generation Q2, maybe rest of the year in terms of the cadence?\nPierre Breber : Well, in terms of working capital, Roger, the first quarter, as you said, was a build in working capital draw on cash, and that was primarily inventory related. If you saw last year, we had draws on working capital that was primarily through taxes payable. And you'll see in the second quarter, some of those payments happening. We try to give everything excluding working capital because over the course of time, that tends to zero out and there's a pattern, but there's some variability around it. So that's the guidance I would give on you.  In terms of free cash flow, it depends on -- and cash from ops depends on commodity prices and margins, and we gave a lot of that during our Investor Day and some upside in downside cases. But in terms of working capital, you'll see timing effects. We try to look through them and exclude them. And then next quarter, you should expect some large tax payments, which will be obviously a draw on cash.\nRoger Read: Okay, great. Thank you. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng : Hey, good morning, guys. Have been the kind of project due to the characteristic that we have different returns and different payback period criteria that I think management put. So for your loan carbon investment, not those that for the own emission mitigation activity, but that in terms of like CCUS as a new business. For that kind of business that what is the minimum internal rate of return and payback period that you sign in order for you to sanction the projects.\nMike Wirth : Yeah, Paul. Look, the reality is these are brand-new businesses. And we've got a lot of confidence in the returns and payback periods that we expect out of businesses we've been in for many decades and understand very well in well-established markets.  These are businesses that don't exist today. They are in part enabled by a government policy the rules of which are not yet fully written and the durability of which we need to ask ourselves questions about as we commit capital to it. So they're different. They're very different.  Our goal over the long term is to get similar returns out of these businesses as we get out of our core business. And so that would be double-digit returns. In the mid-term to the near term, we're going to have to go into some of these things that offer high growth and opportunity with our eyes wide open, but also understand that as we establish them in the early days, we may not see the returns that we expect in the fullness of time.  So we make big investments. Our expectation is over the life cycle of these investments, we're going to deliver those kinds of returns. But we're also mindful of the fact we've got to develop technology. We've got to scale these things. We've got to help markets mature. We've got to build operational experience. We've got to build risk management experience, supply chain and customer capabilities in these businesses.  And so in the near term, we'll be understanding of the fact that the returns in the short term will probably look different than our long-term expectations but we won't go into things that we don't believe offer the long-term prospect for returns, which is why we have steadily avoided more well-established sectors like wind and solar, where we could go into those today because the risks are better defined, but we also understand the returns. And so we were just trying to do these kinds of projects, we would go into those, but they don't offer the kinds of returns we expect out of the things that we're working on.\nPaul Cheng : And second question is that your largest U.S. competitor, just announced that they're going to push more aggressively into trading and establish a single trading organization and think that that's quite a fair amount of opportunities out there in the market that they can capture the sensory taking maybe that someone of a rule book from a payback from Chevron. I think Chevron has always been a little bit more conservative on that. So do you think that really the opportunity for a company similar to Chevron that have a lot of global reach and more of a physical ones and have a knowledge edge over others? So -- is there an opportunity that we may be missing that for Chevron?\nMike Wirth : Well, Paul, what I would say is I think maybe your perception is a little bit miscalibrated from what I would describe. We have always had a global trading organization for many, many years, I used to run it. Pierre used to run it. And so we're in active trader. We trade in a certain way. And I'll give you the three-word kind of overarching description, we flow, optimize and trade. So the first role of our commercial organization is to ensure our barrels and molecules flow to the market. The second is to optimize assets, ships, market positions, market knowledge and be sure we get the most value out of our system that we possibly can. And then the third responsibility is to trade. And we do third-party training. We do what we call Quad 4 trading. On a regular basis, we make money at it, and we have very talented people in our organization to do. We also have good risk management systems to ensure that we understand what we're doing. So I wouldn't describe us as not being a trader. And I don't know if there's a definition, I think you used the word conservative. Look, we're a trader, but we do it in the order that I just described and have done it for a long time on a global basis. So it's a contributor to our earnings, and we continue to look to grow that part of our business.\nPierre Breber : The only thing I would add, Paul, to Mike's answer is shareholders and investors don't own Chevron or like companies for trading earnings. They tend to be volatile. I think the multiples on trading earnings historically have been very low. In fact, most of the large trading houses or private company.  So Mike described exactly what our strategy is it works within the framework of a resource company and refining and petrochemicals company where investors are owning us for safely and reliably delivering energy having the commodity price exposure. And yes, if we can enhance that with trading results, that's great, but we're not going to lead with trading. Thanks, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin : Good morning. Thank you. This one is just a clarification question on something you said about the Permian because I think it's important. In the NOJV section, because you stack royalties with the NOJV acreage, your growth rate in the NOJV portion actually exceeds the growth rate of our partners as they reported. Is that -- that's the correct interpretation, right? That's what we're trying to communicate.\nMike Wirth : Yeah. I mean our -- because we not only get our working interest production out of that, but because we also have -- and we have relatively high working interest in most of our -- these ventures. So it's not dissimilar to the working interest of the operator in most cases. But then we also have royalty advantage and we -- and we account for that or we report that to you through that NOJV.  What we describe as royalty barrels are pure royalty. We've got no capital. We've got no working interest. We're just collecting royalty as the landowner. But you're correct in your interpretation there, Sam. That is why our NOJV is growing a little faster than our co-op production for the same levels of activity.\nSam Margolin : Okay. And then just as a follow-up. This is on capital allocation and I understood that you have the range out there in the buyback. The range is pretty substantial, and there is a decision to make right now about where to be within the range about whether to preserve cash for an opportunity that might come in the downturn, if that's what looks like it's on the horizon or whether to stay at the top end because we're in sort of a market equilibrium in the commodity environment, and you feel good about the pace. And I'm not asking you to predict the future, but it would be great to sort of hear your thoughts directionally about the value of kind of preserving cash on the balance sheet for any day or maintaining a faster pace? Thanks.\nMike Wirth : Yeah, I'm going to invite Pierre to say a couple of words. But Sam, we tried to lay out a couple of cases at Investor Day that showed you in two different price environments, what our capacity was to operate and be within the range and with a low breakeven to cover our CapEx and dividend with a lot of surplus cash already on the balance sheet and then with the very low low-debt levels that we have. We've got plenty of capacity. Pierre, maybe you can just give a thumbnail recap on the scenarios to booking them for Sam.\nPierre Breber : Yeah. In our Investor Day, we looked at the high case and low case scenarios and our guidance right now is towards the high end. And let me just first be clear that we don't intend to hold $15 billion plus of cash on our balance sheet. We can run the company at $5 billion, and this is surplus cash. And this is cash that is temporarily on the balance sheet. It will be redistributed and redeployed to shareholders over time depending on the scenario and the price of both scenarios had us working down that surplus cash because it's economically inefficient for us hold it, and it's not our cash, it's our shareholders' cash. We want to return it through the cycle in a steady way, not pro-cyclically. So that's why it's accumulating. We've paid off all our debt economically, but it's a timing effect. And we showed certainly in the low side case which averaged about a $60 Brent that we could continue buybacks near the low end of the range, and we can do that on by taking surplus cash down. And then also using some of our excess debt capacity because we're well below our 20% to 25% net debt ratio. So we'd want to work towards that low end of that guidance range of 20%, again, to get to a more efficient capital structure. In terms of keeping cash for any day or strong we're always going to maintain a strong balance sheet. We've been in this business for decades and decades. We know the good times don't last. We know that prices are cyclical. We want to manage that volatility for our shareholders. So our shareholders don't have to worry about the commodity price because they're going to get the dividend that Mike talked about, that's been growing for 36 consecutive years. That's grown 6% annually for 15 years. They're going to get that.  And then through a cycle, as we approach the cycle, and we're looking at the cycle coming up here, additional cash in a steady way, right now, about 5% of our shares outstanding through the form of a buyback. And so that's how we're planning to manage the volatility for our shareholders. And we've talked about if M&A is implied in your question that we shown that we tend to use equity for M&A because there is -- commodity prices are volatile. It creates a more stable deal structure. So our balance sheet will always be strong enough to enable us to not only manage commodity prices, but also make sure we're positioned to do what we need to do. And I don't need to remind you that we were the first to do a transaction coming out of COVID when we announced the acquisition of Noble Energy, and then we followed a year or so later in acquired Renewable Energy Group. Thanks, Sam.\nSam Margolin: Thank you. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So can you talk about the general demand trends you're seeing within your system? Are you starting to see any signs of weakness on the demand side? And if the answer is no, just curious on your views on what's happened to spot refining margins globally and what seems like still a relatively tight market.\nMike Wirth : Yeah. So John, a couple of thoughts, I guess. I'll just go by the product commodities. I mean gasoline demand is essentially back to pre-pandemic levels globally. Obviously, there are regional variations in this. We're sitting in California here on this end of the call. We've had a very wet winter. And so the first quarter reflects an unusually wet season on the West Coast. In Asia, we see demand coming back, right, as economies continue to continue to open up and mobility has increased, et cetera. But broadly speaking, gasoline flat. Diesel had kind of carried the complex through COVID and global demand has been at pre-pandemic levels for a while now. First quarter demand in '23 is a touch lower than it was in first quarter of '22. Could be an indicator of the beginning of some economic slowdown, but it's certainly, I think, premature to conclude that. But diesel is maybe not leading the parade quite as strongly as it had been for the last couple of years. Jet demand continues to grow. And it's still below kind of prepandemic levels. China is the place, obviously, as everybody has been paying attention to domestic travel up to nearly 90% of pre-COVID flights in and out of the country still well below that. And we see flights being scheduled. You see indicators that suggest travel will grow. You listen to the airlines, and that certainly seems to be what they anticipate, but that's in progress. So that's a kind of a quick look across the product slate.  I think margins reflect a couple of things. One, a year ago, we were in a period of recovering economies and we're coming out of a period of rationalizing refining capacity around the world. And you can go to any part of the world and find refineries that had shut down that perhaps people expected would close one day, but it happens relatively quickly. And at the same time, you saw big growth projects that had been deferred because of the uncertainty relative to COVID a year later here.  You don't see refineries closing at the same rate. We've seen refinery startups in the Middle East. We've seen projects here in the U.S. and in Asia as well.  So refining capacity coming into the system demand has moderated a little bit. Margins have come down. They're still stronger than historic margins if you look out over a longer period of time, but trending back down towards mid-cycle. Pretty strong in the U.S., maybe under a little more pressure in Asia, but you got to think about the feedstocks in Asia, where they're coming from, how they're priced and how those markets are working.  So I don't see any big warning signs flashing, but certainly, we're paying close attention to it.\nJohn Royall : Very helpful, Mike. Thank you. And then maybe sticking with the downstream, and you mentioned California. Can you just talk about the new regulations in California around the potential for excess profit penalties not sure if that's exactly how to refer to it? But how much does that impact how you think about refining in California and your position in California and maybe the expected impacts on the broader market there?\nMike Wirth : Yeah. I'll talk about it, sure. So the bottom line is this is now into a rule-making process. There's no impact right now. And it's into kind of a bureaucratic phase. I think implementation is likely to take quite a while, and it's hard to say exactly how it plays out.  What started as an effort to create a windfall profit tax was unsuccessful because you need two thirds of a vote in the legislature for new tax in California. That then modified into some other forms and ended up moving into the Energy Commission, where there will be a group established that will gather a lot of data and try to assess the profitability of industry again some standard, which I think is yet to be fully articulated. So this is going to take some time. It could potentially result in in some sort of a fine or a penalty for margins or profits above a level, but I can't tell you how it's going to play out because it's -- there's a lot of work to be done there.  I guess the things that I would say are pretty predictable are maybe two. One, there are substantial new reporting requirements, and there's a lot of data we're going to have to produce. We're happy to do that. We'll work closely with the Energy Commission to make sure we get them the information that they're requesting.  And then the second is, I don't think this does anything to encourage investment or new supply, which is really what's needed in a marketplace commodity markets to bring prices down on average over time. In fact, I think it runs the risk of doing the opposite of discouraging investment of decreasing supply over time, which if demand does not moderate, will tend to exacerbate volatility and over time probably result in, on average, higher levels of price. So that's about all I know about it at this point, and we'll watch it as it unfolds.\nJohn Royall : Thank you. \nOperator: I'm sorry, we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, guys. This is Kalei on for Doug. So thanks for taking the question. The first one is on the new Permian disclosure. So you guys are forecasting flat royalty volumes. So I'm wondering, as that becomes a smaller part of the production mix, how is the cash margin from that asset affected going forward?\nPierre Breber : Well, royalty barrels have essentially an infinite margin. And so I think if you and Doug can do the math is it's a slightly lower percentage than that will be a part offset, but there's lots of other drivers that we're doing to enhance margins. And we've shown return on capital employed near 30% at $60 Brent equivalent for our premium. So it's a high return low-carbon asset and the royalty barrels, as you know, come with virtually no cost, and that's part of the advantage that we have.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. I appreciate that, Pierre. My second question goes to TCO. Just wondering if we can get an update on timing of first oil from the new expansion projects and the dividend magnitude for 2023.\nMike Wirth : Yeah. So the expansion project, as I said, there's a lot of turnarounds in activity, both this year and next year. And at our Investor Day, we laid out a bar chart that gave you an idea on production.  The real I think the time, as I said earlier, when you're going to see the production growth will manifest itself in 2024 because the next two years, we've got a lot of these turnarounds, ties, et cetera, in place. So Pierre, you can guide on dividends.\nPierre Breber : No change in our affiliate dividend guidance that we shared on the last call of $5 billion to $6 billion for the full year. That includes tinges and our other affiliates. We expect, like last year, a dividend in the second quarter, that will be modest and then a larger dividend in the fourth quarter.  TCO continues to hold more cash on its balance sheet to manage through both completing uncertainty around the project and around transport alternatives -- but that cash will come back over time. It's been performing very well. But we don't give specifics on that by year. It's embedded in our overall affiliate dividend guidance.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate that there's still some turnarounds to work through. But as the production hit a steady state, what do you expect the dividend cadence to look like?\nPierre Breber : So as I said, last year, there was in two quarters. This year, again, it will be second quarter and fourth quarter, and we'll just -- it's up to the TCO Board of Directors to make the decisions going forward. Hey, thanks for your questions. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Silverstein with UBS.\nJosh Silverstein : Good morning, guys. Just curious about the pace of rig activity in the Permian. You guys are adding one per quarter this year. Outage to be to support growth next year. I'm just curious, as you continue looking forward into next year, do you need to add four more rigs next year to keep kind of that 10% growth pace? Is it less because you're getting more efficient in the Delaware production I'm just curious how you're thinking about the step-up in activity going forward.\nMike Wirth : Yeah. I mean we've pulled rigs down dramatically in 2020, and we didn't want to surge back with everything all at once. And so we entered this year with 10 we expect to exit this year with 14 COOP rigs running. And I think consistent with the longer-term production profile that we've outlined we got a big base business that does have decline underneath it. And so you're going to expect us to add some additional rigs as we move into '24.\nJosh Silverstein : Got it. And I know there's a lot of activity stepping up across the rest of the kind of Lower 48 Haynesville, DJ. They're a little bit more on the gassier side. I'm curious if you guys are pulling back any activity because there are a little bit more gas from in this price environment. Thanks. \nPierre Breber : We've -- we're adding a rig in the Haynesville. We talked about that for a number of years building up to that activity. Gas prices are going to be volatile. And frankly, we need to get developing that resource. We have some offset operators. And so if we don't get after it, it's the time for us to do that.  DJ still has a heavy liquids component, no change in our plans. In fact, the DJ and Argentina are a couple of other areas where we expect production in the second half of the year to be higher where we're increasing a little bit of activity. And again, all of that is within our existing CapEx budget.\nMike Wirth : Thanks, Josh. \nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler\nRyan Todd : Thanks. Maybe first off, just a quick follow-up on -- on the comments earlier on and the question on trading, in the international downstream, your earnings were particularly strong this quarter. And I think in the slides there, there's a $270 million other bar, positive other borrowing chart there. Is that primarily trading? And anything to read on that going forward? Is that something that likely reverses or maybe some clarity there?\nPierre Breber : You're right. We referred to it. I would not say it's primarily -- it's a lot of factors, and we pointed out to that. It's consistent with how Mike described our trading business. And as all trading businesses are, it can be variable in future quarters. So it's just one of many factors. It's not primarily, but we wanted to cite it as one of the elements in that other variance.\nRyan Todd : Thanks, Pierre. And then maybe on the Permian, if you look back at the Permian you've also -- you obviously talked at the Analyst Day, you talked about a variety of the shifts in the 2023 development plan versus 2022. I think -- and you highlighted similar here to that. I think we appreciate some of the near-term impact -- can you talk at all to what some of the longer-term implications are of the shift to more single bench development adjustments to pacing more shift towards New Mexico, et cetera. Does it have any impact on -- like does the move to increase single bench development have any impact on the productivity or recovery of other zones in the area? Does it change at all how you think about service infrastructure and logistics how you think about resource depth in different parts of the portfolio over the long term?\nMike Wirth : Yeah, Ryan, I would say not really. We've always been return seeking. And so this is all about optimizing the return we can get out of this asset over the long haul. We've tried to be thoughtful about surface infrastructure. We've tried to be thoughtful about drilling to keep surface infrastructure fully utilized, not over building it for peaks and then leaving it underutilized for long periods of time. And as we're continuing to learn, the fundamental principles about optimizing return on investment continue to drive all of this activity.  So as we learn more about benches about communication, about productivity as technology changes, recovery factors, we will continue to apply all of those learnings. But the real objective remains the same. It's not volume, it's value and returns.\nPierre Breber : Ryan, and just as a reminder, the move to more single bench is in the Delaware Basin, right? Midland Basin three quarters is multibench development.\nRyan Todd : Thanks, Pierre. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Sorry to go back to the Permian, but I'm going to ask another. I was wondering, and I appreciate all the disclosures are really helpful. But in terms of the non-op component of production, does the proportion stay relatively stable through your forecast period? I think you gave a forecast out to 2027 at the Analyst Day. Does the non-op proportion stay the same? Or do you have more operational barrels between now in '27?\nMike Wirth : Yeah. It stays relatively similar, I would say, Jason. We can provide further insights on that as we. There's not a big shift. We're growing activity. As I mentioned earlier, we're adding rigs and you got a pretty big base you're adding in on top of. So those percentages don't move a lot.\nJason Gabelman: All right. That's helpful. And then just one accounting question. Depreciation fell decently quarter-over-quarter in upstream. What was that related to?\nPierre Breber : Are you looking at it excluding special items or.\nJason Gabelman: Yeah. If I look at the quarter-over-quarter Slide 7, Upstream DD&A was positive $345 million.\nPierre Breber : Yeah, why don't you follow up with Jake? That could be tied to some exploration activity.\nJason Gabelman: Okay. Thanks. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada.\nBiraj Borkhataria : Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about Namibia. You recently farmed in a few months ago. Could you just walk me through plans for the next 12 months or so what you've got pencilled in? And then I've got a follow-up on something else. Thank you. \nMike Wirth : Sure. So we've completed seismic acquisition in Namibia at the end of February, and that's being processed right now. And so I can't really comment any further on that. We certainly are mindful of others who have had certain exploration success in the region, which is encouraging, but we need to do the work on that and then determine what the next steps are, which can include drilling exploration wells. So stay tuned on that as we got more information, we'll share it with you, Biraj.\nBiraj Borkhataria : Okay. And then just on a different topic, cost inflation because more and more, you hear some of the service providers talking about improving pricing and so on. So could you just comment on your latest thoughts and what you're seeing on the cost inflation side outside of the Lower 48? Thank you.\nMike Wirth : Sure. So really no change to our mid-single-digit inflation guidance in our current year capital spending. As you note, in the Lower 48, there are some areas where we planned for higher inflation and we're seeing that.  I'll remind you that a lot of what we do in our procurement activities are longer term contracts that are either fixed price or index based. We've got detailed cost models to challenge price increases. We commit volumes to certain things over longer periods of time to try to create a win-win between us and our suppliers.  And so we've not seen some of the cost push through that you would see if you were buying services or commodities inputs on a spot basis or then current basis because we manage that activity differently. For instance, on offshore rigs, we're fully contracted for this year. We came into the year with three rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico. They're generally below current market rates.  And so I think we're managing this well. The one thing I would say is given, these kind of index-based contracts, there are periodic reviews where we will reset based on market indicators. And so in the second quarter in certain parts of our business, we'll be going through this with some of our partners, and we'll see some resets on there that will probably reflect a little bit of the inflation that I referred to earlier, that's already built into our plans. But I think we're managing all that within the range that is embedded in the guidance we've given you.\nBiraj Borkhataria : Thank you very much. \nMike Wirth : Thank you, Biraj. \nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Patrick [ph] on behalf of Neil Dingmann. For my question, it's with respect to Venezuelan exports, I know previously, you made mentioned really no further capital investments in Venezuela. What we're curious to know is there a maximum threshold of exports and sales that you're anticipating out of Venezuela?\nMike Wirth : Is -- there a maximum -- I mean it's limited by our position there and the entities that we're involved in and what our portion of that production that we're entitled to market is. We're currently seeing about 100,000 barrels a day of production up from about 50 when the license term changed.  That actually go up further this year, maybe another 50% if everything goes well. The rude comes to the U.S., and we're finding a market for the crude. And yeah, it's a six-month license from OPEC, and we have to bear that in mind. So that's why we are proceeding, as you said, which is we've got some past receivables that are being paid from some of these proceeds and there's a lot of relatively straightforward workover and other activity that can help bring production up at -- without major capital commitments. And so that's the current model. We'll see how things unfold and hopefully pointed in a good direction, but it's been a bit of an up and down situation, and we have to -- we just have to take this one step at a time.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's tough here. I guess just as a follow-up, would there be -- are you exploring that six-month term, are you looking to extend that at all? Or is it too early to be negotiated.\nMike Wirth : That's a decision made by the U.S. government. It's not really a negotiation. It's their decision, and it's a policy matter we're asked for input and so we provide input on these things. But for the last several years, these things have had relatively short time lines associated with them.  And so we're in full compliance with all the conditions of the sanctions and intend to stay that way. And we'll just see how the policy making turns out.\nPierre Breber : This is Pierre. I'm going to go back to Jason's question. So yeah, lower depreciation is really three drivers. Some of it was the absence of some abandonment accruals that were in the fourth quarter. So you can view those as sort of nonrecurring.  And then some of it is due to new rates. So each year, we revised our depreciation rates based on additions to proved reserves, and those rates are a little bit lower. And then, of course, first quarter production was a little bit lower than fourth quarter production. So lower volumes also contributed to that lower depreciation.\nJake Spiering: I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you.

I am Jake Spiering, Head of Investor Relations. Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Eimear Bonner, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Please review the cautionary statement on slide two. Now I will turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Wirth: Alright. Thanks, Jake. This quarter, Chevron delivered strong financial and operational results, returned record cash to shareholders, and achieved project milestones that are expected to deliver production and cash flow growth over the coming years. We continue to see strong performance in the Permian, executed major turnarounds at TCO and Gorgon ahead of schedule. Worldwide production increased by 7% from the prior year and set a third-quarter record. We started up the high-pressure anchor project and began water injection to boost production at the Jack Saint Melo and Tahedi fields. These projects, combined with additional project startups through 2025, are expected to grow Gulf of Mexico production to 300,000 barrels per day by 2026. We have expanded our CO2 storage portfolio, adding over two million acres offshore Western Australia. In September, the FTC completed its review of the company's merger with Hess. We also recently announced several asset sales as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization efforts. This quarter marked the one-year anniversary of the PDC Energia Position. We have successfully combined the two companies, taking best practices from both and applying them across our shale and tight portfolio. We have exceeded our guidance of $500 million in combined capital and cost synergies by more than 30% and have delivered more than $1 billion in incremental free cash flow since acquiring PDC. Jurn's well performance is 40% better than the DJ Basin average, and we continue to optimize development plans. We have advantaged inventory, with around 75% of locations at a breakeven below $50 per barrel. We expect to hold production at a plateau around 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day through the end of the decade. Our operations in Colorado are among the lowest carbon intensity in the industry, benefiting from tankless production facilities that lower greenhouse gas emissions by 90% compared to older designs. Where possible, we utilize grid-powered rigs that reduce more than 60% of our on-site greenhouse gas emissions from drilling. At TCO, the team continues to deliver consistent progress on project milestones. All four Pressure Boost facilities are now online and operating with high reliability. All production is flowing through these facilities, which allows optimization of existing plants and enabled the highest daily production in the field's 31 years of service. Remaining metering stations are all under conversion, and we are confident in the incremental well capacity that will feed FGP. We have initiated final leak testing for the wet sour gas compressors and are preparing the crude processing systems for operation. Complex commissioning activities will continue over the coming months, leading into initial startup activities in the first quarter of 2025. We continue to divest non-core positions at significant value. We have announced asset sales in Canada, Alaska, and Congo, which will contribute before-tax proceeds of approximately $8 billion pending regulatory approvals. We expect to close these transactions in the fourth quarter. In Canada, we received a compelling offer for our Kaybob Duvernay shale position and non-operated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands project. Both are good assets, and we have a long history there, but they are a better fit for a reputable counterparty and an attractive deal value for Chevron. Now, I will turn it over to Eimear to discuss the financials.\nEimear Bonner: Thanks, Mike. We reported third-quarter earnings of $4.5 billion or $2.48 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.5 billion or $2.51 per share. Organic CapEx was $4 billion for the quarter, in line with our budget. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry, ending the quarter with a net debt ratio under 12%. Cash flow in the third quarter was the highest for the year despite lower oil prices. Working capital decreased by $1.4 billion on lower inventory levels. Share repurchases were a record $4.7 billion at the top end of our quarterly guidance range. Our financial priorities are unchanged, and we plan to use our strong balance sheet towards shareholders consistently through commodity cycles. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down about $150 million. Adjusted upstream earnings were down mainly due to lower realization and high dividend at TCO, partly offset by higher lifting. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily due to favorable timing effects and higher US volumes. This was partially offset by lower US refining margins. Adjusted third-quarter earnings were down $1.2 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted upstream earnings were flat. Lower liquids realizations and higher DD&A were mostly offset by higher liftings and timing effects. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased mainly due to lower refining margins. All other was down primarily due to interest expense. Third-quarter oil equivalent production was up around 75,000 barrels per day from last quarter. Strong production in the Permian, primarily in our company-operated New Mexico assets, was the main driver. We expect full-year average production growth to finish at the top end of our guidance range of 4% to 7%. Costs always matter in a commodity business. We have a track record of managing unit costs well below inflation while successfully integrating several acquisitions. Higher returns require competitive costs and safe and reliable operations. Executing turnarounds on budget and on schedule is a key performance driver, and we have delivered outstanding performance in 2024. Our teams have collaborated across upstream and downstream to standardize the approach to these complex maintenance events, increasing the days our facilities are online and lowering unit costs. While we anticipate significant volume growth in the years ahead, we also expect to deliver $2 to $3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including the expanded use of global capability centers. Now looking ahead, in the fourth quarter, Upstream will have downtime, which is expected to be split between US and international operations. Impacts to production from divestments are expected to be around 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter. Downstream, we will have higher planned maintenance primarily at El Segundo and Pasadena. We will also have a shutdown at the Pasadena refinery, enabling the light tight oil expansion to come online. We anticipate affiliate dividends to be around $1 billion this quarter. Share repurchases are expected to be between $4 and $4.75 billion in the fourth quarter, unchanged from prior guidance. Proceeds from asset sales are expected to be about $8 billion before taxes. Back to you, Jake.\nJake Spiering: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Justin, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. If you have a question at this time, please press star one on your touch-tone telephone. To allow for questions from more participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.

If you are listening on a speakerphone, we ask you to please lift your handset before asking your question to provide optimum sound quality. Again, if you have a question, please press star one on your touch-tone telephone. And our first question will come from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi. Good morning. The main feedback I have heard from investors hesitant on Chevron is wanting resolution on TCO startup and test. At what point should investors consider TCO startup largely derisked? Is there, like, a specific milestone in the commissioning and startup process, like where you have listed here, where you say, okay, startup probably really cannot slip much from here, and are we there now?\nMichael Wirth: Yeah. So thanks for the question. You know, we are making great progress, and I think you saw that again this quarter as we have had several quarters now where we have laid out expected milestones and delivered on them. So the team is delivering predictable commissioning and startup activity, and I ran through some of the current state relative to low-pressure production, strongest day of production ever, etcetera. That said, there is still significant complex commissioning work ahead, particularly on the future growth project. That work is well underway here, and we expect, as we said, to begin startup procedures in the first quarter. So our cost and schedule guidance is unchanged. You know, one of the key things for us, and this is a learning from other projects over the years, is to ensure reliability. We want to make sure that we have everything ready to start up safely and then run reliably as we go forward. And so we are going to continue to be very methodical in the way we go about starting up the equipment there. But every quarter that passes, it is being derisked. I do not know that there is a magic threshold you can say it is entirely derisked, but everything we see is very positive. In fact, Eimear was there just recently along with Mark Nelson. Maybe, Eimear, you can share some of the things you saw at TCO.\nEimear Bonner: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. And, yeah, it was great to be back and to be with Mark and Jake and the team in Tengiz. When we were there, they actually achieved a key milestone the day we arrived in Tengiz, and that was when they fully transitioned to feeding all of the existing six production trains with low-pressure production fed through the pressure boost facility. So I think the fact that the production was at high levels producing through the pressure boost facility just shows the high reliability that has been achieved there. We also visited three sites at Tengiz, Jean Ann. The first one was the operations and control center, and there, we saw how they are leveraging the advanced process control technology, digital tools to really optimize production, keep the plants full, and plan work safely. So that was great to see that to be part of the project, and it is really enabling a whole new level of optimization. We went to the sites that Mike talked about where the complex commissioning is ongoing. So the third generation site, there is a large, high number of equipment that is being commissioned there. So we talked to the team about the high diligence they are being to ensure that we do the performance testing on the equipment, we commission the equipment, and we do that in a very methodical way. So that was great to see. We also went to the third generation injection facility. And with the design that we have, we will be injecting all of the produced gas into the reservoir to help with pressure management. And they were doing injection testing when we were there. So that is a key bit of derisking to know that the wells will take the sour gas into the back end of the reservoir. So overall, it was a great visit. You know, we came away really encouraged by the work of the team, by the consistent progress that is being achieved, but also by the just the rigorous planning and thought that is going into ensuring a safe and reliable startup and ramp-up over the first half of 2025. Thanks for the question, Jean Ann.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah. Good morning, Mike and team. I just want to spend some time on the Permian. You had indicated in the prepared remarks that you expect to finish towards the top end of the 4% to 7% range in guidance. And you highlighted strength in company-operated New Mexico. Can you spend a little bit more time unpacking that, the sustainability of that, and just how should we think about the path to ultimately getting to plateau at this asset?\nMichael Wirth: Yeah. Neil, we did have a nice strong quarter again in the Permian. I realize a lot of our activity now being in New Mexico, the data is not quite as timely and transparent maybe as on the Texas side. And so you may not see that, but a couple of things. Number one, our new well performance has been very, very strong in the Delaware Basin. We have got a lot of that in the third quarter, particularly, we are in the second Bone Spring. And seeing top quartile performance out of those wells. Also on the Texas side and the Delaware and the Wolf Camp A, we are outperforming expectations. So new wells and completion of pop time on those new wells have been very, very strong. In the base business, we are seeing stronger reliability performance, proactive maintenance efforts are paying off. We are seeing artificial lift optimization now sustaining strong production. And we are seeing efficiency gains in everything from completions designs, coordination, and logistics to reduce mobilization. We have talked about triple frac before. And so across the entire activity portfolio in the basin, we just continue to see improvement in the execution of that and then improvement in the performance of the wells. As we move towards the, you know, the million barrel a day mark next year, we will begin to shape our profile there a little bit towards a plateau. And we will really begin to focus on free cash flow. And so growth will become less the driver, and free cash flow will become more of the driver, if you will. So we will bring capital spending down, and I think what you will see is this year is probably going to be the peak in Permian CapEx. And as we move forward, we will start to attenuate that. The growth, which has been at a, you know, a 15% CAGR for the last three years, probably going to be higher than this year, will begin to attenuate as well, and we will really open up the free cash flow there. So more to follow. In terms of exactly what that looks like. I am sure people are curious about that. So we will provide more guidance here, you know, over the next call or two, so you can start to think of what that looks like. But the, you know, the headline here is continued efficiency and productivity gains, strong free cash flow today, and we are going to manage it for even stronger free cash flow in the future.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Doug Leggett with Wolfe Research.\nDoug Leggett: Good morning. Sorry. I had a frog in my throat, Mike. I appreciate the opportunity to ask you a question. You know, if I could observe as a kind of precursor to my question, this is probably your best operating quarter in quite a while, so congrats. The share price is responding accordingly. But if you look at your relative underperformance since you announced the Hess deal, it is clearly a huge, you know, weight of uncertainty on the stock. It basically wiped out the value of Hess. So it is a Hess question. And it goes something like this. You have now got FTC since we last spoke in the last call. You have got the shareholder vote, and you are moving ahead with I guess, what many would think with the post-Hess acquisitions disposals. Synergies presumably are not related to Guyana. Why not go ahead and close the deal if you are so confident in your legal position?\nMichael Wirth: Well, look, the relative performance of the shares relates to a lot of things. Number one, and so I would not dispute the fact that the Hess uncertainty is a material contributor. But as you said, we have had some performance unevenness that I think we have, you know, ironed out and we need to prove that. But you know, we announced the cost and schedule update to TCO during this period of time. So there have been a number of things that I think are all part of that, all of which are a high priority. And as you see today, we are getting a lot of attention and I think improving. Look, we have got a deal structure with Hess that has a condition precedent that if there is an arbitration, the arbitration has to be concluded. We are confident that it will be successfully concluded, but you know, that is where we set the deal up and we are going to execute the transaction the way the transaction is written and integration planning is going very well. We are working very closely on everything that we can at this point in the process to prepare for the future. And I realize that the timing on this is unfortunate, but we are continuing to move forward and look forward to integrating the two companies and being really the premier oil and gas company prepared for the energy transition. Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask around the Canada sales. So if I go back to the Hess deal, you know, the rationale was to buy, you know, long cycle high-quality resource and obviously diversify your portfolio. And Guyana is very different from Canada, obviously, but could you just talk about the decision to execute that divestment now ahead of the arbitration decision? Which was a surprise, but also more broadly, you know, I would have thought you were a net buyer of long cycle resource. So if you could just talk about how you are thinking about that and how you are thinking about the portfolio, that would be helpful.\nMichael Wirth: Sure. So, Biraj, we have got a long history in Canada. AOSP has been, you know, a steady contributor of cash for many years. But, you know, we have also indicated that as a 20% non-op position, it was not really viewed as a core asset in the portfolio. So as we were marketing the unconventional position in the Kaybob Duvernay, we were not actually marketing AOSP, but the buyer came to us and proposed buying both. And made us a very attractive offer to buy both. You know, the Duvernay, while it is a good asset, we are struggling to compete against the strength in other parts of our shale and tight portfolio. And AOSP, you know, as we have indicated for some time, is a non-core asset we were willing to consider offers for it, but there was a long time when I think potential buyers were struggling to give us the value that we saw, to your point, for a long-duration asset. The Canadian producers are faring better today. I think their valuations have recovered, and so we were presented with an opportunity to transact at what we thought was good value and we have been patient. Others have left the oil sands over the years at what we felt were discounted values, and we were not prepared to do that. But when we got a value that we thought was a fair value, you know, we were prepared to transact. And, you know, yes, we want to add good quality long-duration assets to the portfolio, but we have a lot of those in our portfolio today. And so I do not think you should read our desire for those kinds of assets to say that anything that would kind of broadly fit under that heading is not eligible for potential divestment. We are going to continue to high-grade our portfolio over time and as we add quality assets and use technology to improve the value of assets in our portfolio, we will always ask ourselves if the balance of the portfolio has more value to others than it does to us and be willing to entertain that kind of a question. Thanks, Biraj.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Josh Silverstein with UBS.\nJosh Silverstein: Thanks, guys. Just on the $2 billion to $3 billion cost savings, how much of this comes from the announced $8 billion of asset sales year to date versus what maybe comes from additional asset sales and structural savings, and then any split between upstream or downstream?\nEimear Bonner: Yeah. Thanks, Josh. So let me talk you through kind of our plan here given that it is new material. So first of all, as you saw on the slide, we have been disciplined in managing our costs competitively over the years. So this program is essentially our next set of cost reduction steps to sustain our discipline given that in our business, costs always matter. They are always important. So what we are focused on here is reducing absolute costs while we deliver significant growth in the business. Think about this program as focused on the controllables. We are expecting run rate reductions to be realized over the next few years by the end of 2026 from a 2024 baseline. So the full benefits will be seen in 2027. So in terms of where the reductions are coming from, the first category is really portfolio actions. So examples like what we have heard today in the call and the United Canada, Alaska, Congo, sales. So there is a large portion of this associated with that. We see the direct cost be reduced as the asset transfer from our portfolio. And then we would expect overhead costs associated with those assets to reduce over time. So that is one part of this program. The second part is just improvement initiatives that we see across the organization. They are coming from the business units, all segments. They are coming from the functions. You know, some examples of what we are talking about here are initiatives that leverage technology solutions to reduce cost, drones, robotics, digital twins that have transformed how we think about operating and maintaining our facilities. That would be an example. Another example would be improvement initiatives that really look to how we do our work, where we do our work, an example there would be the recent announcement of the engine global capability center in India. So in these centers, we are looking to standardize and centralize more of our workflow. So that is really what the program is. You know, when you think about the range, you know, what I would say is the first $2 billion, think about these as divestments and cost reduction initiatives that are in our plan, they are either execution ready or working towards becoming execution ready. Think about the third billion as an additional target that we have with initiatives that are underway that we have not really quantified. They are not execution ready. We have work to do to make them execution ready. So that is how I would describe the range and, you know, we expect to provide updates on these initiatives. We will do that through 2025 as we execute on them and deliver results. Thanks.\nOperator: And we will go to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet and shareholder returns. Your net debt ticked up a bit quarter over quarter in 3Q versus 2Q, I think supporting strong buybacks, and you are still well below your long-term targets. You have cash coming in the door from asset sale proceeds, as you noted, between now and year-end, and then a nice inflection in the Permian and TCO cash flow into next year. But I guess my question is given how volatile commodity markets and oil markets specifically have been in recent times, how do you think about continuing to use the balance sheet to support shareholder returns versus tapering it back and waiting for potentially lower commodity prices over the next few years? So balance sheet use and how you think about that is the core of the question.\nMichael Wirth: Yeah. Devin, let me just address share repurchases, then I will let Eimear talk about the balance sheet. Recent volatility in commodity prices, for somebody who has been in this industry for 42 years, is not new news. That is the way this industry works, and we are in a volatile cyclical commodity business. So, you know, the backdrop is nothing we are not well prepared for. First thing is I just want to reiterate our guidance, you know, the share repurchase run rate of $17.5 billion is unchanged. The range we have given you, you know, kind of brackets the way we execute the program, and we were, you know, a little bit above the, you know, the midpoint of that here this most recent quarter. We have got a strong track record of buying back shares, which is our fourth financial priority, and that is after, you know, making sure we can sustain and increase the dividend where we have got a track record of doing that for 37 years in a row. Reinvesting in organic projects to grow future cash flows, to support that. So the second priority, the third is to maintain a strong balance sheet. We have got a AA credit and below 12% net debt. And then the fourth is to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases, which we have done for 17 of the last 21 years. And so consistency in financial priorities, consistency is very important. And I think we have got a track record that we can stand behind there through commodity price cycles. You know, over the last 21 years where it says 17 of 21 that we have repurchased. We have seen a financial crisis. We have seen a pandemic. We have seen OPEC, you know, open up the taps and, you know, commodity prices respond accordingly. And so we have been through down cycles. We have been through unexpected circumstances and have maintained a strong track record of shareholder distributions through it. In part because we have maintained a conservative financial position and a very strong balance sheet. I will let Eimear talk a little more about the balance sheet.\nEimear Bonner: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Devin, you know, when we look at the balance sheet, you know, we are focused on maintaining its strength through the cycles. Right? It is an asset that we use to create value and to navigate the volatility that Mike talked about and reward shareholders consistently. So when we look at our debt levels today, our net debt is under 12%. That is at the low end of where we have been over the last ten plus years. So we are under-levered and given this and all the growth that is coming and the additional asset sale proceeds that we are expecting in the short term, we are comfortable with where we are, and, you know, we anticipate the net debt will come down a little bit in the near term with the asset sale proceeds that are coming. But we are planning with a multi-year time horizon with a through-cycle approach, and we are very comfortable with where we are right now with the balance sheet. Thanks.\nOperator: And moving on to Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies.\nLloyd Byrne: Hey. Good morning. First, congrats to you and your M&A team. I think the divestiture progress has been great. I want to follow up quickly to Biraj's question. AOSP seemed very opportunistic. Does that change your long-term goals? And then really, I wanted to ask about the DJ and see whether, I mean, it is just really impressive operating progress there. Synergies, free cash flow, but I think the surprise has to be you guys holding it flat to the end of the decade. Maybe you can just comment on the opportunities there and whether there are more opportunities for scale.\nMichael Wirth: Thanks. Yeah. So just to quickly touch on AOSP, you know, there was one kind of most logical buyer. Right? And it was the operator, and we have had discussions over the years and have not been able to really get to a common view on value. And so that is what has changed. And so if you want to see that as opportunistic, that is fine. But we really wanted to realize the value that we saw in that asset, and we have been able to do that. The DJ, look, you know, the first thing I will say is the integration there and the synergy delivery continues to track record that we have had over a long time of exceeding our synergy commitments. And, you know, when we do a deal and we come out with a target, it is intended to give you a high confidence number that you can use, and we have done the diligence we have at that point in, you know, our track record as we find more and we deliver more. We are very happy with the quality of the asset and the ability to drive strong performance. We have learned from each of the companies that we have acquired. I talked a little bit about the lower carbon footprint there. We have seen some other things like gas lift and new laterals that have been used. Some of these companies that we are starting to work with in some of our other parts of our portfolio. And the last thing I will say is the team there does a wonderful job of balancing the multi-step permitting process, and I know there has been some concern expressed by people about the regulatory environments. You know, we are working very closely with the regulator in Colorado to ensure that we can achieve their objectives and that we can achieve our objectives. And I would say that is a very constructive relationship. We have got comprehensive area plans in place that derisk the longer-term development. And the quality of the assets, you know, 400,000 barrels a day out through the end of the decade. You know, three years ago, we had zero in the DJ Basin. And so very pleased with it. We are big there. We are the biggest operator there. The question was, are you going to acquire some additional positions there? I would not say that is high on the priority list. The real key is to drive value out of this asset.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Betty Jing with Barclays.\nBetty Jing: I was on mute. I am sorry. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I want to ask about the Gulf of Mexico. It feels like there is a bit of a technology renaissance that is happening in the Gulf, including the Anchor project that just came online. Can you talk about how the technology is opening up new resource opportunities for the Gulf for the Chevron portfolio, and does that represent any upside to how you think about the longer-term production and resource opportunities in that area?\nMichael Wirth: Yeah. Betty, it sure does. And it is an extension of the story of the Gulf of Mexico. You know, initially, on the shelf as people moved from onshore to offshore, then out into the deep water, and we began to develop techniques to explore and ultimately develop and produce in deepwater now in the ultra-deepwater and in the ultra-deepwater now at ultra-high pressures and temperatures. And, you know, the breakthroughs on the Anchor project, and it is the first one to be producing with 20,000 psi technology. I mentioned last week in something I was doing just to help people understand that. That is essentially the pressure that would exist if an elephant, a full-grown male African elephant, were standing on a quarter. And so it is incredibly high pressure. These are high-temperature fields that everything that goes along with that needs to be capable of dealing with those pressures that include, you know, trees, blowout preventers, etcetera. We have a three million ton hook load now on the drill ships, which is the highest hook load we have ever seen. That opens up a lot. At least, you know, 20% of our exploration portfolio is going to require this kind of capability. We are using other things like ocean bottom node seismic now, that helps us better characterize developments and exploration opportunities. Think of it as 4D, essentially. Technology out there. We are working on AI tools to help guide exploration focus areas and predict geologic risk factors more effectively. So, yeah, I think the history of the Gulf of Mexico has been technology advancements to continue to allow us to identify and then produce resources out there. It is a vast area. The Mississippi River is, you know, was and is an incredible conveyor belt for organic material out into the Gulf of Mexico, and the industry is not done there by any means. I think there is a lot left to go. And maybe the last thing I will say about it is, you know, this is about unlocking new opportunities. We are also working hard to make better use of existing infrastructure with nearer field development, the ability to tie back at longer distances and develop smaller discoveries that would not support standalone greenfield developments but can very easily tie back as a brownfield to an existing facility. Vallemore is a good example of this, and I think you are going to see more of those as well. So the heyday of the Gulf of Mexico is far from over.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Hi. Good morning. You have an excellent production record in both Tengiz and Gorgon that they have done well. And it is particularly impressive that, given both of them, you have turned around. It looks like the turnaround has done well and maybe that came in faster than the scheduled time? So is it a one-off, or have you changed the process so that this is a repeatable benefit that we could expect in the future?\nMichael Wirth: Well, it is the latter. And we have been working on this both upstream and downstream because these facilities are starting to look a lot more similar than they are different. And to deliver higher returns, one of the keys is to execute turnarounds well, ensure the work that is done enables reliable operations in between turnarounds, and to continually improve on this. I mentioned earlier that Eimear was just out in Kazakhstan and has been into Gorgon not too much earlier. Eimear, maybe you can talk a little bit more specifically about what you are seeing on turnaround execution.\nEimear Bonner: Yeah. No problem. And thanks, Paul, for the question. Yeah. To Mike's point, I mean, our complex facilities, whether they are in refining or upstream assets like TCO and Gorgon, they are more similar than different. And so this has been an area of focus for us to try and standardize how we approach these complex turnarounds to really drive performance. So we have been working on it diligently for a few years. And I think that the improvement actions that I would point to would include maybe the first one is just how we think about the scope of the turnaround. And think about this as looking at all the units and equipment and discerning, can I do the maintenance work on the run, or do I need to do the maintenance work only when the plant is shut down? And so there is a lot of improvement being delivered because we have been very diligent about discerning what is in and what is out. We call that rigorous scope management. And the second improvement talks to the digital tools that we have used to really help with not only planning but execution and prioritization. I will give you a couple of examples of the digital tools. Digital tools that help us with permits, digital tools that help us with isolation, digital tools that help us with leak testing and flange management, in addition to digital tools that help us with managing the span and control given that these turnarounds bring in huge numbers of personnel at once. That is another area. The third one, which I believe we have taken to a whole different level, is benchmarking. And we benchmark turnarounds. We benchmark the units. But the benchmarking that we are doing today, the benchmarking goes down to the equipment level. And so just the rigor in the benchmarking to look for improvements and to learn where we can be more efficient is yielding positive results. Then finally, I would say, we have experts in this area from an organizational capability perspective. We have employees that have spent most of their careers in turnarounds. And so we have looked for opportunities to share resources and to cross-pollinate with these experts so that the lessons that we learn in TCO, we can learn them in Gorgon and vice versa. The lessons that we are learning in refining, we can implement those lessons learned in the upstream. So all of those things coming together have really driven a step change in our performance with nearly nine turnarounds executed this year. Almost all of them have been delivered at industry-level performance. So we are very pleased with this work given the criticality of it to base business excellence, and these results are industry-leading.\nMichael Wirth: Yeah. Paul, eight out of the nine turnarounds were executed in line with first-quarter duration targets. The Gorgon train two turnaround was our best Gorgon turnaround ever, with a 14% improvement in duration. The TCO KTL one turnaround was a 23% improvement in duration compared to the last one. And in several of our refinery turnarounds, we saw cost decreases of up to 50% compared to the prior turnaround of that same unit. So I think there is some real quantifiable progress that you can see across the system that is being achieved. Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. If I return to the structural cost reductions, and I want to put it in the context of the relocation from California to Texas. Is that relocation an opportunity for the cost reductions? I believe that redesign processes and organizations, or is it a threat to the cost reductions where there is chaos and lack of continuity? How do you think about it?\nMichael Wirth: I do not think it is a threat, Bob. We have talked about the relocation occurring over a period of time. We are going to be very thoughtful about moving work from one location to another, moving people from one location to another. Not all of the work being done in San Ramon necessarily will go to Houston. So it may go to these global capability centers that Eimear talked about earlier. Some of it we may find technology tools that help us to do the work more efficiently and automate things. And so I think it is a little bit of a simplistic reduction to think about just lifting and shifting everything from San Ramon to Houston. It is a migration of work to different technology platforms, different locations, and we will do that thoughtfully and methodically over a period of time. We will make sure it is been planned out and derisked. And so, you know, I think it is part of an ongoing work evolution in a global company that has a workforce around the world, that can do work in many different places, that historically did a lot of work in business units because that is the way it had to be done. But now there are other ways to approach this work, and we are looking for ways to do it best to deliver the best work product and do that at a cost structure that is ever improving. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And moving on to Lucas Hermann with BNP Paribas.\nLucas Hermann: Yeah. Thanks very much. And afternoon, Mike and Eimear. A fairly obvious question, I guess. I just wanted to talk to you. I wondered if both of you could talk a little bit more about CapEx going forward, and maybe it is an inappropriate time, and December will be better. But if I look at what is happening with the business, you know, obviously, Tengiz starts up. You have got your assets in the Gulf coming on, you are talking about, you know, driving for free cash or driving for NPV value in the Permian CapEx coming down there. If I think about the current rate of CapEx spend including, you know, associates, it feels as though it is around $18, $18.5 billion if you got at the beginning of the year. If I look at the opportunities for that CapEx to start to fall as projects or as plateau or projects come on, it feels as though, you know, maybe $3, $4 billion of CapEx opportunity sits there or opportunities to support CapEx decline. Yes. It is there. What is really hard, Mike, is to see, you know, where that goes. Particularly given, obviously, everything going on in the Eastern Meds at the moment. So, you know, is it right now to start thinking about CapEx coming down very materially as we move forward over the next two, three years, and you are really starting to benefit more emphatically from a portfolio that, in essence, is, you know, deep in resource but pretty long duration.\nMichael Wirth: Yeah. So you have covered a lot of waterfront there, Lucas. Let me try to address some of it, then let Eimear share some of her thoughts. Number one, I think an important point is if you look at the rateability of our CapEx, we used to have a program that had a lot of big long-duration capital projects. There was a pattern where the back half of the year, fourth quarter in particular, tended to be a little bit heavier at first. Quarter a little bit lighter. We are very ratable now. We have been about $4 billion on our organic CapEx, you know, all three quarters this year. So it has become much more ratable and predictable. That is a reflection of the nature of the projects that we are doing. Point two, you talked about CapEx coming down. A decade ago, our CapEx was $40 billion. Today, you bring in affiliates, as you say, it is $18 something, $18.5 or whatever that number is. So it is less than half of where we were. So it has come down substantially even as production has grown, as the company generates more cash. We are doing it in a much more capital-efficient manner than we ever have before. And then point three is, yes, we will continue to seek further ways to optimize and improve the capital efficiency of our company. A larger portfolio does over time require capital to maintain it, and so, there lies the trade-offs that you evaluate as you look at your capital investment opportunities, the readiness of those, to move into execution. And I think in the near term, what is very clear is our affiliate CapEx will come down next year as the project in Kazakhstan concludes. So you will see affiliate CapEx come off. You know, we are in the process right now of finalizing our business plan for 2025. And so it is a bit premature for me to guide you to that number, but we are looking at all the trade-offs and then we will know more about that after we complete our planning process. But our intent is to stay very disciplined, which I think is something we have demonstrated here over, you know, many, many years now. Our guidance range of $14 to $16 billion is unchanged. And I think you should expect us to respect that. And if that does change, by some quantum and you throw out some larger numbers there, you know, we will cover that with everybody and talk about how it has changed, why it has changed, and how you should think about what that means going forward. Do you want to add anything to that?\nEimear Bonner: I think you have covered most of it, Mike, given that we are putting our plan together right now. Lucas, all I would say is, you know, the projects that you referenced and how we see the CapEx profiles coming off and the free cash flow growing as those projects complete. It is a key focus for us. So we will give you more information on our fourth-quarter call as we complete the process. We do not want to get ahead of the process right now. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And the next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So could you talk about your position in California in the downstream, still having two refineries there, and we have had another closure announced over the past couple of weeks. Is shutting capacity something you have considered in California, and how do you think the market will be impacted by this latest closure? Do you think we will see structurally higher profitability there as a result, or maybe things will adapt kind of back to where they were?\nMichael Wirth: Yeah. John, first of all, I think what I would say is we have seen another ill-conceived move by a state that has implemented policies to deliver its residents the highest gasoline price in the country. This most recent action to insert state bureaucracy into turnaround planning and inventory management is likely to make prices go higher, not lower. Putting bureaucrats in charge of centrally planning key segments of the economy has not worked in other socialist states, and I doubt it will be any different in California. Policies that constrain supply faster than demand is adjusting create more volatility, and they tend to create a greater likelihood of higher prices. And so unfortunately, these measures are advertised as doing the opposite, but the reality is for anybody that looks at them and thinks them through, discouraging investment and constraining supply when you still have strong demand is going to lead to just one conclusion. And so, look, we have operated in California for over a century. Both of our refineries are over a hundred years old. We have got very competitive refineries, and we have got strong integrated value chains with very strong brands, strong customer relationships, and so these are competitive businesses that we will continue to evaluate within our portfolio like every other asset as we have discussed earlier. And so we will continue to meet our customer needs and compete. We will evaluate alternatives if and when it becomes evident that that is the appropriate thing to do. But I will tell you, it is very tough to justify any new investments in that system, and it is only getting tougher. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And we will take a question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. I would like to ask you, Mike, about the LNG markets globally. You know, we have seen some new units get delayed. We have seen a couple of other companies this earnings season talk about, you know, the outlook in terms of supply-demand balance kind of favoring tightness in 2025. Just curious how you look at it and maybe if you could remind us of your, you know, contract versus spot exposure so we could think about how that might play, you know, the margin potential for Chevron in 2025.\nMichael Wirth: Yeah. So, you know, LNG demand continues to grow. But it comes against the backdrop of very healthy inventories. You know, you ask about 2025, inventories in Europe are strong for this time of year. Inventories in the US are very healthy for this time of the year. You see that reflected in Henry Hub prices. And so overall, we have got, you know, a market that currently has healthy inventories and recently good supply becomes somewhat weather-dependent. And so, you know, that can change with a very cold winter. But right now, I would say, you know, it does not look like 2025 is setting up to be a particularly tight market, you know, and then longer term, of course, we have supply coming on in Qatar. We have got supply coming on in the US. And so there is more supply coming to that market. And so I think in the, you know, the short to medium term, it is a market that is not really prone to becoming nearly as tight as what we saw a couple of years ago when the situation in Ukraine began. Our particular portfolio is 80 plus percent contracted primarily on oil index pricing on long-term contracts. Most of our sales are into North Asia. And 20% or less spot exposure, and a lot of that is out of our West Africa position, and we will have some spot cargoes from other parts of the system occasionally. But primarily long-term contracts, primarily tied to crude price. Thanks, Roger.\nOperator: And moving on to Nitin Kumar with Mizuho.\nNitin Kumar: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just maybe touch a little bit on the chemicals business. It seemed like it was a bit of a tailwind to earnings this quarter. What are you seeing from your supply chain, particularly in Asia, you know, you have heard about some stimulus to be offered there, but just looking at what the earnings look like for the chems business.\nMichael Wirth: Yeah. You know, we are actually seeing polyethylene chain margins have strengthened over the course of this year. So it has been an improving market backdrop. Some of that I think has been some short-term supply disruptions in certain areas. These are long-cycle commodity markets that demand grows kind of steadily, but slowly supply comes on in big chunks. And so we have had a market that has been a little bit oversupplied, and that has put pressure on the olefin chains, particularly in Asia. And so, you know, I think over time, we expect to see margins improve. We have got a couple of projects that will come online in the second half of this decade. And you cannot time these things perfectly, but I think they are likely to come on after the trough and into what is in olefin chain markets. One of those projects is in the US, one in the Middle East. Asia is the big market, obviously. Naphtha and naphtha cracking being the alternative, you know, you do have some interrelation on margins with crude oil prices and if at the margin, Asia and AP crackers are what an ethane cracker in the Middle East or the US is competing with. You have got some interplay between those two. And so we will watch it over time. CP Chem is a well-run business, GS Caltex in Korea is a well-run business, and we have seen these kinds of cycles before. We remain very, you know, constructive on this sector over time as we think the fundamentals will be very good in CP Chem and a lot of ethane-based feedstock, which makes it very competitive. Thanks, Nitin.\nOperator: And moving on to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. Maybe just hi. Good morning. Maybe one on the Eastern Mediterranean. Could you maybe just provide a status update in terms of kind of current operation, the Tamar expansion efforts, the next leg of potential expansion of commercial development there, and what impact I guess, what is and is not happening or moving forward given the current uncertainties in the region right now?\nMichael Wirth: Sure. So, obviously, you know, the priority is the safety and well-being of our employees and the integrity of the assets. We have seen the demobilization of the pipeline vessel that was working on, you know, the current expansion projects at both Tamar and Leviathan as, you know, the contractor concluded that, you know, the current risk environment was one that, you know, they were not comfortable with. We see both of those projects still being completed late next year. We will keep you advised, you know, obviously, this will depend on when that is remobilized. But we have got projects underway in the short term at both Leviathan to increase production, you know, by about 200 million cubic feet a day to 1.4 BCF. And Tamar is about half a billion cubic feet per day from 1.1 to 1.6. So those are on track for late next year. We have entered feed for a larger expansion at Leviathan that would take us up, you know, significantly more. There is some room on the platform to add more processing capacity. That is a project that would be completed towards the end of this decade. And we are in feed on that now. So more to follow. I think in the short term, obviously, you know, we are going to make sure people are safe. We have had to actually take production at Leviathan down a couple of times because of some of the risks in the region. But we are meeting all of our supply commitments both in the country and to regional customers. And I have been able to do that despite, you know, the conflict that is underway.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Alastair Syme with Citi.\nAlastair Syme: Hi, Mike. You talked earlier about the operated Permian position. I just wanted to get a sense of what you are seeing in the non-op and royalty piece. You know, are we seeing a two-speed operating system in the basin with respect to what various operators are doing? Thank you.\nMichael Wirth: Yeah. You know, we have seen strength across all three of the components of our business. Our club growth this year, as I said, is probably going to be a little bit higher than the 15% we have seen the last three years. Royalty may be a little lower than that. I know a little bit higher. I do not know. I think you said that we see a two-speed development approach. I would not say that. I would say we are all kind of in the same fairway. Certainly, some of our NOJBN royalty is in highly attractive sweet spots. And I think the economics on that are very good for our partners or our operators where we hold the royalty interest. And I would not say there is significant enough variation between our program and what we see with others to describe it as a two-speed program if that was the question. Thanks very much, Alastair.\nJake Spiering: I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Justin, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Chevron's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 2, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-08-02 14:25:02", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Justin, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead.\nJake Spiering: Thank you, Justin. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings conference call and webcast. I\u2019m Jake Spiering, Head of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Eimear Bonner are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMichael K. Wirth: Thanks, Jake. This quarter, Chevron delivered strong production and extended our track record of consistent shareholder returns. Production increased by more than 11% from the prior year and included a new quarterly record in the Permian. Over the past two years we\u2019ve returned over $50 billion to shareholders, approximately 18% of our market cap. We continued to advance growth opportunities in our traditional and new energies businesses through adding new exploration plays in West Africa and South America, achieving key milestones on the ACES green hydrogen project and commissioning of the Geismar renewable diesel plant expansion, which is expected to come online by the end of the year. The merger with Hess achieved a successful shareholder vote, and we now expect the FTC review process to conclude in the third quarter. The arbitration panel addressing the Stabroek JOA has set a hearing for next year. Hess had requested an earlier hearing, but the panel ultimately sets the schedule. We remain confident this is a straightforward matter and the outcome will affirm a preemption right does not apply. We\u2019re committed to the merger and look forward to combining the two companies. In the Gulf of Mexico, we\u2019re leveraging our deepwater expertise with plans to deliver high cash-margin, low carbon intensity production growth. First oil at Anchor is imminent, delivering the industry\u2019s first deepwater 20,000 pound development. The project is on-track to come in under budget while deploying multiple breakthrough technologies. After Anchor, three more projects are scheduled to come online and we expect production to grow to 300,000 barrels a day by 2026. Our developments have become more capital-efficient, unit drilling costs have come down and facility designs are optimized for high returns. As one of the largest leaseholders in the basin, we\u2019re well-positioned for the future with leading technology capability and attractive exploration opportunities near existing infrastructure and in frontier areas. In the Permian, base business performance continues to improve, with higher reliability and lower decline rates. Development activity continues to get more efficient. We\u2019re one of the first operators to deploy triple-frac, delivering cost reductions of more than 10% and shortening completion times by 25% where applied. In the Delaware Basin, company-operated well performance continues to improve as we optimize development strategies. In the Midland Basin, early well results are lower versus last year, our program in the second half of the year is more heavily weighted to development targets that we expect to perform better. With strong momentum in our operated portfolio and predictable results from our non-operated and royalty acreage, we now expect full-year production growth of about 15% and fourth quarter production to average around 940,000 barrels per day. At TCO, cost and schedule guidance is unchanged, with FGP expected to start up in the first half of 2025. We continue to bring major equipment online and complete key project milestones. Eight out of 21 metering stations have been converted to low pressure. Three Pressure Boost Facility compressors are in operation. A third gas turbine generator is in service. The first 3GP process system is ready for operation, and we completed the SGI turnaround on time and under budget. The wells converted to low pressure are meeting expectations and the Pressure Boost Facilities are operating with high reliability. Over the next two quarters, we\u2019ll continue converting the field to low pressure while further commissioning key equipment for FGP. The project team remains focused on completing the project safely and starting up reliably to deliver value to Kazakhstan, TCO and shareholders. This quarter was a little light due to some operational and other discrete items that impacted results, but I remain confident we\u2019re well-positioned to deliver on long-term earnings and cash flow growth. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Eimear to cover the details.\nEimear P. Bonner: Thanks, Mike. We reported second quarter earnings of $4.4 billion, or $2.43 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.7 billion, or $2.55 per share. Results in the quarter were impacted by downtime in Upstream that weighed on realizations, higher exploration expense and Downstream turnaround timing. Organic CapEx was $3.9 billion, in-line with budget. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry, ending the quarter with a net debt ratio of 10.7%. Chevron generated solid cash flow of nearly $9 billion excluding working capital. Working capital lowered cash flow due to tax true-up payments outside the U.S. and a build in inventories. We expect about half of the working capital to unwind in the second half of this year, primarily in the fourth quarter. We again demonstrated our consistent approach to returning cash to shareholders with $6 billion of dividends and share repurchases. Adjusted earnings were lower by $700 million versus last quarter. Adjusted Upstream earnings were down mainly due to lower liftings, higher exploration expense and absence of favorable tax impacts from the prior quarter. Partly offsetting were higher realizations. Adjusted Downstream earnings were down due to lower margins and reduced capture rates, this was partially offset by timing effects. All Other decreased mainly due to a tax true-up. Versus last year, adjusted second quarter earnings were down $1.1 billion. Adjusted Upstream earnings were flat, higher realizations and liftings were mostly offset with higher DD&A due to the PDC acquisition and the absence of prior year favorable tax items. Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased mainly due to lower refining margins and higher turnaround and transportation OpEx. The Other segment was down primarily due to state tax adjustments. Worldwide oil equivalent production was up over 11% from last year due to the acquisition of PDC Energy and significant growth in the Permian Basin. Now, looking ahead. The third quarter will have heavier than usual maintenance with several turnarounds at Upstream assets, including TCO and Gorgon. Impacts from refinery turnarounds are mostly driven by El Segundo. There will be a one-time payment related to discontinued operations of around $600 million. We anticipate affiliate dividends to be around $1 billion this quarter. With the project in Kazakhstan nearing completion, we expect quarterly dividends from TCO moving forward. As a reminder, Chevron pays a 15% withholding tax on dividends from TCO which lowers both earnings and cash flow. Share repurchases are targeting the $17.5 billion annual guidance rate. Asset sales in the second half of the year are expected to be aligned with full-year guidance. Back to you, Mike.\nMichael K. Wirth: Okay. Thanks, Eimear. Today we announced we\u2019re moving Chevron\u2019s headquarters from San Ramon to Houston to enable better collaboration and engagement, both internally and externally. We also announced the retirements of Nigel Hearne, Executive Vice President, Oil, Products & Gas; Colin Parfitt, Vice President, Midstream; and Rhonda Morris, Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer after long and distinguished careers. I want to extend my sincere thanks to Nigel, Colin and Rhonda, for their service and their many contributions to our company. And finally, I\u2019d like to offer our deepest condolences to the family of our former Chairman and CEO, Ken Derr, who passed away three weeks ago. Ken\u2019s vision and leadership helped guide Chevron through momentous times to create a high-performing company with outstanding people and a portfolio that distinguishes our business to this day. Ken left an indelible legacy for our company and all those whose lives have been made better by his leadership. He will never be forgotten. Back to you, Jake.\nJake Spiering: That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019re now ready to take your questions. Please ask you to limit yourself to one question. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Justin, please open the line.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Thank you so much and congratulations to Nigel, Colin and Rhonda on their retirement. My question, Mike, was really focused around TCO. And, it sounds like we are making progress on that project, but this is a critical period of time during the summer productivity period. So, just would love your thoughts on how FGP is progressing. And then, as it relates to Kazakhstan, we\u2019re getting a lot of questions about the concession extension as we think about next decade and I recognize that\u2019s a long way away, but maybe you can help to address some of the investor debate around that topic as well?\nMichael K. Wirth: Sure. Thanks, Neil, and thanks for your kind remarks about our retiring executives. So, at TCO as I covered in my comments, we\u2019re really seeing steady and consistent progress. Work is being planned and liquidated in sequence, which is resulting in strong daily, weekly and monthly progress. I get a weekly report straight from the project team with a tremendous amount of detail. I\u2019m in regular contact with them, and I can tell you that they are really on top of their game. As I said, we\u2019ve got three of the pressure boost facilities up and running, the fourth not far away and WPMP is operating very reliably. So, we\u2019re pleased with the performance of the equipment. We\u2019re very pleased with the performance of the wells flowing at low pressure and its early days, but it augurs very well for the maintenance of strong production out of the field for a long time to come. On FGP, we\u2019re going to have additional FGP major equipment and systems ready for operations or started up later this quarter. And, we\u2019re just going to continue to work our way through that. We\u2019re moving in a more complex process units as opposed to some of the big rotating equipment and field metering station conversions. So, the nature of some of the startup work on FGP will be a little bit different. The other thing to recall is, we do have a large turnaround this quarter. So, good progress. The one thing that we won\u2019t compromise is safety or reliability in pursuit of schedule, but I can tell you that the team is all over that. With respect to the concession, we\u2019re really focused right now on getting this project up and running. The concession exploration is nearly a decade away, and the most important thing we can do is make sure that this big complex project is started up safely and reliably. To remind people that may not know, this is one of the world\u2019s deepest producing supergiant oil fields and it\u2019s the largest single trap producing reservoir in existence. So, TCO is very important to the Republic of Kazakhstan, it\u2019s very important to us and we\u2019ll certainly be in discussions with the government over time about potential extension. The key thing is an extension needs to create value for the country and it needs to create value for Chevron shareholders. We always seek that kind of an outcome. We\u2019ve extended concessions in other places where value was created for both parties. And then, there\u2019s been some instances over the recent period of time where we couldn\u2019t achieve the outcome and we did not extend. So, we\u2019ll be talking more about this subject over time, but right now we\u2019re really focused on project execution and continuing the strong performance on delivering FGP. Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: And, next is Alastair Syme with Citi.\nAlastair Syme: Thanks. Mike, this period of limbo around Hess is obviously a period you don\u2019t want to be in. It\u2019s not clear to me when the FTC rules or if they push out, until arbitration as I sort of previously indicated. But my question to you is, do you feel limited to do any other significant portfolio development in this interim period? I guess if the right opportunity came along that is?\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes. You could do something else if you wanted to. This is the transaction, that\u2019s the right transaction for us. And so, we\u2019re very focused on it, Alastair, and we\u2019ve made good progress with the shareholder vote, we\u2019re steadily marching along with the FTC, and I\u2019ve already mentioned the timeline on the arbitration. So, it\u2019s sometimes good things you have to work for and this will take a little bit more time than we had anticipated, but we remain confident in the outcome. And, as I tried to cover in our prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got a really strong queue of organic growth opportunities in flight right now. We didn\u2019t mention the Eastern Med, which is another one. So, we\u2019ve got projects in multiple regions of the world that are poised to deliver growth over the next three years, absent it we be at 10% growth in free cash flow, we\u2019ve got projects coming on in numerous basins in the world and in our chemicals business as well. So, we\u2019re really focused on that and creating value there. But, if another opportunity were to present itself that were compelling, we\u2019re certainly in a position to consider it. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And, the next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Mike, can you talk about the potential for further cost efficiency gain? Where that you see over the next, say, two or three years the biggest opportunity? And, could you quantify that? I mean, how big is that opportunity set for you guys? Thank you.\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes. Thanks, Paul. I appreciate it. You and I have known each other for a long time. So, you know that capital discipline and cost discipline are near and dear to my heart and they always matter in a commodity business. Year-to-date and Q2 unit OpEx for us was about $16 a barrel, which is down about 5% from 2022. And, improving unit OpEx continues to be a focus. Some of the actions we\u2019re taking today driving down energy usage, which is a way to both reduce cost and emissions. At the same time in the Upstream, we\u2019re electrifying rigs in the Permian, we\u2019re lowering steam use at our San Joaquin Valley operations, in the Downstream we\u2019re implementing energy efficiency projects at our refineries that reduce gas consumption and power use. We\u2019re also optimizing supplier contracts, implementing a minimum functional objective approach to operations and maintenance activities at key assets like TCO and our LNG plants in Australia. And, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll continue to find new ways to increase efficiencies and reduce unit cost. Our plans would call for further unit cost reductions. And, I think you can look for us to use technology. For instance, the breakthroughs we\u2019re seeing in data technology offer significant opportunities for both efficiency, asset productivity, improved safety and other performance. And so, you can rest assured that I am focused on costs, we are focused on costs and you\u2019ll continue to hear more about that from us over time.\nJake Spiering: Thanks, Paul.\nMichael K. Wirth: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: And, the next question will come from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just go back to Kazakhstan and the FGP ramp up. So, I wasn\u2019t asking an operational question, but I appreciate FGP is on-track. But, it was related to the OPEC promises or curtailments. Kazakhstan this year has been a bit ahead of its quota, stated quota. If you take the headline figures from OPEC into next year, it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s a huge amount of room in that quota to grow. And obviously, FGP is a fairly substantial project. So, just wanted to get your thoughts on any sort of issues or risks related to that? Thank you.\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes. Thanks, Biraj. So, obviously we are not party to those discussions. We comply with the requirements in any country where we operate including if they have some sort of production targets or requirements that they impose upon producers in the country. We have not received any indication from the Republic of Kazakhstan with regards to any curtailments relative to OPEC+. What oftentimes happens there is with the production in several big assets, you have turnarounds, projects and other things that create some degree of variability across multiple different producers and I think the Republic looks to manage that and fit their plan together. So, I don\u2019t have any unique knowledge about 2025, but we have a very close relationship. I will tell you that the TCO barrels, I think from a contribution to the Republic standpoint are very attractive and our intent is to produce at the full capacity any point in time for our facility in order to maximize revenue for the Republic and for Chevron. So, if there\u2019s further developments on that front, we\u2019ll certainly provide them, but we don\u2019t have anything from the government right now. Thank you.\nOperator: And, we\u2019ll take a question from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Mike. I\u2019m delighted to see you guys come to Houston. Welcome. But, if you want to stop by for coffee, let me know. But, Mike, I missed out on the last earnings call, and I apologize for bringing it up. I know it\u2019s highly sensitive and highly, I guess, subjective, but the issue around the delayed arbitration, I wanted to pose a question to you and see if we can get you to probe a little bit on this. ExxonMobil, regardless of their motivation, has stated that they have no interest in buying Hess. But, at the same time, our understanding is the bigger concern is global contractual rule for credibility, protecting that aspect of a contract. So, when I go into two months of the legalities, I wonder, is there a compromise that could cut short the arbitration timeline so you don\u2019t have to go to arbitration? For example, acknowledge you have a ROFR, but Exxon acknowledges they\u2019re not going to exercise a ROFR so everybody gets to protect your contracts for Exxon and secure your acquisition for Chevron. Is it a compromise that could cut the arbitration short is my question?\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes. Hey, it\u2019s great to hear a familiar voice back on the call, Doug, and I look forward to seeing you in Houston. What you have outlined is very sensible. It could be the foundation for something, but I really can\u2019t comment on specific conversations. I think we have indicated previously that there was a period of time where Hess and Chevron worked with the other partners in the Stabroek block to try to find a resolution here that accommodated everybody\u2019s interests and that time has now passed and we\u2019re in the arbitration process. So, that\u2019s the path that we\u2019re on. We sought something along the lines of an outcome as you described earlier, but it doesn\u2019t appear that, that is how this is going to end up. Everything is confidential obviously the language in the contract and contracts around the world have specific language and in each instance. I think the parties understand how that contract is written and how it would apply. So, I really can\u2019t say anything more about it than that.\nJake Spiering: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: And, the next question comes from Josh Silverstein with UBS.\nJosh Silverstein: Hey, thanks, good morning, guys. Nice update in the Permian. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more details around increase in the fourth quarter outlook. Was this due to the new Delaware completion technique from Chevron? Any thoughts on non-op royalty volumes? And then, just looking at the Midland side, was there anything kind of specific as far as the zone or completion that you guys are now shifting away from to get increased productivity there? Thanks.\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes. So look, the Permian is performing strongly as you can see in the numbers. And, just to remind everybody about 80% of our program is in the Delaware. Delaware performance is up year-on-year and first half \u201824 production overall in the basin now averaged over 870,000 barrels a day, which is essentially flat or even a touch up from fourth quarter of last year. The drivers of that are improved performance across multiple dimensions of the business and in the base business we\u2019re seeing lower decline from proactive maintenance efforts, lower operated downtime, artificial lift optimization. I mentioned triple-frac earlier, which is reducing costs and increasing cycle time. So, the spud-to-pop cycle has shortened further. So, we\u2019re getting more pop days online than we might have a year ago and well performance as I said in the Delaware has been very strong. In the Midland, some of the first half pops have been a little bit below expectation. There\u2019s only a finite number of pads I could count them on one hand that are involved in this. And we\u2019re always moving into new zones, new acreage. And as part of that, we\u2019ve got an active learning and continuous improvement efforts to be sure we\u2019re optimizing development across the basin because it is not completely homogeneous. So, as we\u2019re testing new zones to better inform our future development plans, we learn. In this particular case, the learnings will be applied as we go forward. That said, it performed very well in the past. I think the thing you can pull up from that and look this is a big long-term asset that\u2019s got a lot of life ahead of us and we should be continually improving in it, so that over time we can deliver even stronger returns, stronger performance and we should be learning as we develop it as the basin matures and it\u2019s exceeding expectations for this year. We\u2019ve raised our full year guidance and we\u2019ve got great confidence in what we\u2019ll deliver in 2025. Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Hey. Good morning.\nMichael K. Wirth: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: Good morning, Mike. And, yeah, welcome to Texas. If we could maybe dig into the Gulf of Mexico, as you said, the first kind of 20,000 PSI development. What are the -- given that it\u2019s new, what are some of the experiences you\u2019ve had or the industry has had with this level of pressure. And what are some of the things we should be watching for, maybe in another way of asking the question, how have you gotten comfortable on the technology side in terms of bringing this forward and developments behind it?\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes. I might make a couple of comments on that and then ask Eimear who before becoming our Chief Financial Officer was our Chief Technology Officer. The moving into that pressure regime, obviously you need bigger equipment because you got to contain higher pressures, you\u2019ve got greater wall thickness on all your equipment, it\u2019s heavier, you need heavier hook loads to lift and deploy equipment. You\u2019ve got a lot of technology qualification to satisfy our own standards and to satisfy the regulator that every element of your kit is proven at pressures well beyond what anything that it will see in service. So, this goes from components large to small and you get into tighter tolerances and a whole host of things as you step up the pressure regime there. So, I would say that we\u2019ve worked closely with some of our suppliers who have developed the specific equipment that is in place and we\u2019re very pleased with everything from the drilling rigs and the equipment that\u2019s used in drilling to trees and production kit both subsurface and surface. Eimear, you might have some thoughts from your technology days to share with folks.\nEimear P. Bonner: Yes. Mike, you hit on one key thing and that is that the partnership that was demonstrated here with ourselves with industry partners to be able to deliver the first 20ks subsea development. And to your question in terms of how did we get comfortable, I think it was because we brought the best of our engineers, the best of our suppliers, and the best technology that we had, several examples of technology, proprietary technology that we brought. And the extensive, testing, quality testing that took place before we went out to the field. So, some things to mention, just to put that in perspective, we delivered the first 20k subsea well completion and subsea production trees and manifolds. So, this is the core equipment that protects us from loss of containment and ensures that we safely and reliably can operate the field. We drilled wells. We developed a drilling rig. We built a drilling rig with our partners to enable drilling at these depths and the equipment to allow us to do that. That had very special dynamic positioning and technology as well. On the subsurface side, when we think about the prospect and how we were able to see the prospect and get some a really good accurate image of the prospect, we used our proprietary seismic technology here. This is more of our in-house Chevron proprietary technology to help us with that image and that enabled us to make the right decisions about the development and optimize the development. So, those are just a couple of examples of where the surface and the subsurface technology really enabled us to achieve this outcome.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Eimear, I wanted to stick with you, and I have a bit of a strategy question for you. If we kind of put together several of things that\u2019s been talked about on this call so far, the TCO start up, strong Permian production growth, rising production in the Gulf of Mexico, it all kind of materializes in the form of this inflection in free cash flow as we go into 2025 and beyond. And Chevron has historically had four, I think, very consistent priorities for use of cash. But now that you\u2019ve had some time in the CFO\u2019s team, I was wondering if you could talk about your views for the optimal use of cash, especially in the context of your current low leverage levels and how you\u2019re thinking about the trade-off between further dividend growth or more buybacks as cash flow rises over the next few years?\nEimear P. Bonner: Yes. Thanks, Devin. Well, I\u2019m thinking about it consistent with how we have for decades and consistent with our long-standing financial priorities. So, just to step through them, first, it\u2019s growing the dividend, that\u2019s our first priority. So, cash that enables us to continue with our track record of growing the dividend for 37 years. So, that\u2019s the first priority. And when we look at the projects that we have and the growth that\u2019s underway that Mike talked about, our 10% free cash flow growth really supports future dividend increases. So, when we think of cash, that\u2019s where it goes, first and foremost. Secondly, is to invest in the business to deliver profitable growth and do that capital efficiently. This is an area of leadership for Chevron when you look at the percentage of the CapEx as a percentage of CFFO. So, I\u2019m focused on ensuring that we maintain leadership in this area. To your point about the balance sheet, our third priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet, and we are currently under levered and we expect and are comfortable to modestly relever over time, but to stay within historical ranges. And we look at our balance sheet as an asset to create value, and manage volatility and ensure steady capital returns through the cycle. And when we\u2019ve satisfied all three of the financial priorities, the fourth is to return surplus cash to shareholders through buybacks and that\u2019s what we intend to do and we take a multi-year view of that considering a range of commodity prices. So, in my time with the company in the business side and on the corporate side, I\u2019ve seen how these financial priorities have served us well and they\u2019ll continue to serve us well. And so in my time, they\u2019re not going to change. Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Nitin Kumar with Mizuho.\nNitin Kumar: Hi, good morning, Mike, and thanks for taking our questions. I want to maybe shift focus on the downstream side. Last quarter you had a heavy turnaround schedule and just the way cracks worked out, it probably wasn\u2019t the best timing. As you\u2019re coming out of that turnaround, what are you seeing in your markets? And if you can maybe touch on renewable diesel specifically with Geismar coming on later this year, what\u2019s the outlook for economics of biofuels?\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes. So, you\u2019re right. We had some turnaround activity in the second quarter that occurred during the more attractive margin portion of the quarter and then we had more capacity back online as margins dropped precipitously in some cases. So, we didn\u2019t capture as much as we could because of the timing of some of our activity. Globally product demand is decent. Overall demand for oil is going to be up 1% to 2%. Most products have recovered to pre-COVID levels plus or minus. And we see, I think decent economic growth underway around the world. We\u2019ve had some new refining capacity come into the system in the Middle East, in Africa, in Mexico, and in Asia. So, it\u2019s coming online, so it\u2019s in startup. So, you\u2019re seeing some capacity come online and inventories have all risen over the first half of the year and they\u2019re at or above five-year levels. For some period of time, we\u2019ve been of the view that margins were going to revert towards mid cycle by this year or next year and that\u2019s certainly I think what we see going on in some cases. Mid cycle has been pretty tough in some parts of the world and we\u2019re back to pretty tough margins. And that\u2019s maybe a way to transition to renewable fuels, where these are markets that are heavily influenced not just by supply and demand, but also by policy, because a lot of the value is driven through the credits associated with those. We\u2019ve seen periods of time in the past where the targets didn\u2019t come out of EPA until after the compliance year had already ended, which was challenging. We\u2019ve now seen APA get ahead of the game and set numbers well out into the future. And it\u2019s hard for people to anticipate markets. And so right now what we\u2019ve got is a market where a lot of capacity has been incentivized and we don\u2019t have the RBOs that necessarily match up with it. So, in an over supplied market credit values are down both at federal level and at state level. We welcome to our margin business. This is the way value chain businesses work at least through my career, much of which has been in the Downstream and you need to be prepared for it. And you need to have a capital efficient investment philosophy, which we do. Some of our refinery investments have been to create flexibility to move back and forth between fossil feed and renewable feed. We\u2019ve done that. We\u2019ve idled some plants, which you do when you\u2019re in a period like this and we\u2019re completing the Geismar project, which will give us scale and importantly feedstock flexibility. And in the margin business, you need to have access to affordable, competitive and reliable feedstock. The flexibility that Geismar will have will allow it to compete very well. We\u2019ve got another project underway, a joint venture with Bunge to move back into the bean crush portion of the value chain, which further helps us assure competitive supply into Geismar. But this is a business where we\u2019re going to see periods of time where margins are tough and you probably see some competitive capacity under pressure and so that shutdown and over time then they\u2019ll tend to cycle the other way. So, we\u2019re in this business for the long haul. We think drop in renewable fuels are going to be part of creating a lower carbon energy system in the future. And we\u2019re very committed to that business through good times and through the challenging times we\u2019ll be pragmatic, efficient and value chain oriented in optimizing that business.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You guys have built out a pretty larger exploration portfolio the past few years and I think you\u2019re starting to delineate some of that acreage. And I\u2019m wondering, out of the positions you\u2019ve amassed around the world, what you\u2019re most excited about? And then related to that specifically on Namibia, there\u2019s a lot of interest in the market about that region. Could you remind us what your drilling plans are for that region this year and any interest in consolidating the space given a number of small and large players over there? Thanks.\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes. Thanks, Jason. You\u2019re right. We have added some new acreage to our portfolio and some acreage that\u2019s in areas that are kind of more frontier than some of the stuff we\u2019ve historically held. Look, we\u2019re excited about I\u2019m excited about any number of regions in the world. I\u2019ll start with the Gulf of Mexico where we\u2019ve got projects lined up as I mentioned earlier and a lot of expertise. We\u2019re one of the largest leaseholders in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And as we move into these higher pressure regimes, we\u2019re well positioned to continue to have exploration success and development success there. The second one I\u2019ll point to is the Eastern Mediterranean, where we\u2019ve got interesting acreage in the offshore western portion waters off of Egypt. We\u2019ve got some plans to drill there. We\u2019ve got a discovery where we\u2019ll do a delineation well on the Nargis discovery. And then the third one I would point to is West Africa and that would include existing positions in places like Nigeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Namibia, where there\u2019s certainly been a lot of interest lately in Namibia. We\u2019ve seen others make some discoveries. In the Orange Basin, we\u2019ve got a lease PEL 90, which sits just outboard of where an interesting discovery has recently been made. And we\u2019ve got a well there that will spud in the fourth quarter of this year. It will be completed in early 2025. We\u2019ve already executed the Reagan well construction contract. So, we\u2019re very excited to see what that delivers. In terms of additional acreage in Nigeria, we farmed into a block in the Walvis Basin, PEL 82 and are interested in continuing to add to our acreage position there if opportunities present themselves. So, we\u2019ve got three ways of bringing resource into the company. You can explore for it and discover it. You can acquire it or you can unlock it through technology and all three of those receive lot of attention. We\u2019ve got talented people working in each area to bring resource in through all of them. But I\u2019m excited about some of the new exploration acreage that we\u2019re adding. Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. I had a question given that you have a unique position in Venezuela and we\u2019re watching an election and a post-election unfold. Any comments on what you\u2019re seeing from your folks on the ground? And maybe if there\u2019s any vision, what your role in Venezuela could look like in a range of presidential outcomes?\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes. Bob, on the ground, what we\u2019re doing is really monitoring the situation. You\u2019ve seen the news coverage and our focus remains on the safety of our employees and their families and the integrity of the assets in our joint venture operations. We\u2019ve been a constructive presence in Venezuela for most of the last 100 years. We conduct our business there in compliance with their laws as well as the laws of the U.S, which in this particular case are administered under a general license issued by the Treasury Department. And we\u2019ve seen some encouraging results here recently since the issuance of the most recent general license, our JVs are produced around 200,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re being repaid debt that we have been owed and are steadily achieving that objective. We\u2019ve also seen the extension of some of the concessions on some of these non-operated joint ventures that we are involved in. So, we remain apolitical in Venezuela and in other countries. We\u2019re there to help develop the economy, support the people, create jobs and not get involved in politics which can swing in any country from party to party. And we have found that it\u2019s best to work with the government that\u2019s in power, respect the fact that that is the government that we have, but not take positions that would make it difficult for us to continue to work with a subsequent government. So, we don\u2019t have a role in selecting governments, we\u2019re a commercial player, not a political player. And again, our focus is really on keeping our people safe and the assets protected. Thank you, Bob.\nOperator: And next is Neal Dingmann with Truist.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning. Thanks for getting in. Mike, my question for you and the team is just on OFS costs. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any change in prices given the very recent fall in oil prices. And if so, or just going forward, would you expect to see maybe domestic cost hold while international stays firmer or vice versa?\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes, certainly in the economy broadly speaking, we have seen inflation pressures easing and I think that\u2019s good for consumers, it\u2019s good for economic growth. These things vary across geographies and as you say, you can see different dynamics in the onshore and the offshore. We are seeing some softening of pressure in the onshore, some declining in prices for oil country or oil class tubulars, rigs, prop and trucking. Some of the frac services are more stable. We have a contracting approach that generally sets up index-based pricing over longer periods of time which tends to buffer increases. It can also buffer the decreases. So, we\u2019re not a big spot player. We tend to have longer term contracts and look for things that allow our suppliers to plan their work and allocate their people and resources accordingly. And some of these things lag on the way up, they lag a little bit on the way down. But I think in the onshore, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re seeing some easing of pressures. I think in the offshore, you\u2019re seeing a little bit of a reverse. There is more activity going on in the Deepwater. You\u2019re seeing rig rates firm in some cases. So, this is a place where we also take a longer term contracting approach. We\u2019ve got multiple rigs contracted out over multiple years. They are typically laddered, so that they don\u2019t expire simultaneously and we\u2019ve lagged into the market across the cycle, so that we\u2019re not exposed to any one particular point in time. So, certainly not the inflationary pressure we\u2019ve seen a couple of years ago. Thank you, Neal.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Geoff Jay with Daniel Energy Partners.\nGeoff Jay: Hey, guys. This is, maybe a follow-up to Jason\u2019s question about exploration earlier, but I noticed you got involved in Uruguay back in March. Is that an analog to the Orange or Walvis basins? And just wonder if you can maybe update us on what you think the potential could be there and what the timeline of exploration might be there?\nMichael K. Wirth: Yes. So, we did pick up a block off Uruguay and there are beliefs that there are certain conjugate margin analogs that we see on the South American side of the Atlantic. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of work that needs to be done to explore those theories and in some instances we have seen evidence that supports it in other instances less so. So, we\u2019ve also picked up some acreage in Brazil, in Suriname. So, across that whole Eastern Coast of South America, we have got some pretty good exposure and intend to do the geotechnical work and seismic work to understand the prospectivity of it. So, very early days on that particular prospect, but we\u2019re intrigued by it and it\u2019s an example of what I mentioned earlier that we\u2019re moving into some areas that are a little more frontier than where we\u2019ve been over the last number of years.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Betty Jiang with Barclays.\nBetty Jiang: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to the Permian. It\u2019s great to see the momentum, the operational momentum you\u2019re seeing on the operator side. Just given the triple fracs and certainly acceleration of the cycle time, curious how you think about this, pull forward of activity. Would you likely to do more with the same equipment, or would things slow down or ended up using less equipment? And also curious about what you\u2019re seeing on your royalty and non-operated production front as well?\nMichael K. Wirth: Okay. Let me start with the royalty and non op first. We\u2019re continuing to see strong contributions from that. We\u2019ve got line of sight to essentially all the AFEs this year across that acreage and it\u2019s been if you want to call it the upside performance we\u2019ve seen this year has been spread across all three of those portions of our business, company operated royalty and NOJV. So, strong contributions from those two. When you get to the Permian, yes, these efficiencies have accelerated activity. We get through more lateral feet of wells, we complete more feet, we use more consumables and sand and everything as we do that. Some of the easing of pressure on cost of goods and inputs helps us offset that and so we are trying to manage, we are going to manage to our CapEx numbers. And you can expect us to balance out activity and capital. We\u2019re not going to get off to the races on capital. We\u2019re going to see very disciplined out of the budget is a budget. But the nice thing is we\u2019re getting -- because of the improved cycle times, improved efficiencies, we\u2019re getting more productivity out of the equipments, we\u2019re getting more production per unit of capital input and that really is the story here. So, you can expect us to land our capital as we\u2019ve guided it at close to $5 billion and the production as we have guided in our prepared remarks.\nOperator: And our last question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, my question is just if you could give some color on the downtime you saw both Gorgon and Wheatstone in 2Q. What was the source of those outages? And how are the facilities running now? And maybe include some color on the planned work you called out for Gorgon in 3Q?\nEimear P. Bonner: Yes, John. So, the down time in upstream in May and June was associated with some unplanned events in Gorgon and Wheatstone. So, on Gorgon, there was a blade failure. So, they had to take some time to repair that. They used the time when they were down to try and do as much maintenance as possible. On Wheatstone, they actually had a gas leak that was discovered by an operator. And we\u2019re always going to shut the plant down and repair any leaks in the spirit of operational excellence. So, they repaired that, it was on the fuel gas system and got things back up and running. So, the repairs were executed safely and efficiently and we still expect both of those assets to run with good reliability this year with top quartile performance. The Gorgon, asset turnaround is currently underway and that\u2019s going really well. So, we expect that to come in under the planned duration this quarter. And even with or despite the downtime, we expect to close the full year and deliver on the plant production for the combined Australia assets.\nMichael K. Wirth: Thanks, John. I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today\u2019s call. Please stay safe and healthy. Justin, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Chevron\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "CVX", "quarter": 1, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-04-26 00:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. \n I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead. \nJake Spiering: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Eimear Bonner, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. \n Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. \n Now I'll turn it over to Mike. \nMichael Wirth: Thanks, Jake, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Chevron continues to deliver strong operational performance, maintain cost and capital discipline and consistently return cash to shareholders. First quarter marked 9 consecutive quarters with adjusted earnings over $5 billion and adjusted ROCE above 12%. \n During the quarter, we also returned $6 billion in cash to shareholders, the eighth straight quarter over $5 billion. We also grew production more than 10% from the same quarter last year and announced final investment decisions to grow our renewable fuels and hydrogen businesses. \n Earlier this month, we announced our third Future Energy Fund focused on venture investments in lower-carbon technologies. The merger with Hess is advancing, and we intend to certify substantial compliance with the FTC second request in the coming weeks. We believe that a preemption right does not apply to this transaction and are confident this will be affirmed in arbitration. We expect the proxy for the Hess shareholder vote to be mailed in April with a special meeting date in late May. This strategic combination creates a premier energy company with world-class capabilities and assets to deliver superior shareholder value, and we look forward to bringing the 2 companies together. \n At TCO, we had achieved start-up of WPMP this month with the first inlet separator and pressure boost compressor in service and conversion of the first metering station to low pressure now complete. Later this quarter, we expect a second pressure boost compressor online and a third gas turbine generator to provide power to the Tengiz grid. Metering station conversions are planned through the remainder of the year as additional pressure boost compressors start up, keeping the existing plants full around planned SGI and KTL turnarounds. \n We continue to make significant progress on FGP and expect to have additional major equipment ready for operations in the third quarter. Costs and scheduled guidance remain unchanged with FGP expected to start up in the first half of 2025. \n Now over to Eimear to discuss the financials. \nEimear Bonner: Thanks, Mike. We delivered another quarter of strong earnings, ROCE and cash returns to shareholders. We reported first quarter earnings of $5.5 billion or $2.97 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.4 billion or $2.93 per share. Cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximate $300 million international upstream ARO settlement payment and $200 million for the expansion of the retail marketing network. We also had a working capital build during the quarter consistent with historical trends. \n Chevron delivered on all of its financial priorities during the quarter, an 8% increase in dividend per share; organic CapEx aligned with ratable budget inclusive of progress payments for new LNG ships; sustained net debt in the single digits while issuing commercial paper to manage timing of affiliate dividends and working capital; and share repurchases of $3 billion. \n Adjusted earnings were lower by $1 billion versus last quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings were down due to lower realization and liquids liftings. Partly offsetting were favorable tax impacts. Adjusted downstream earnings were lower mainly due to timing effects associated with the rising commodity price environment. All other decreased on higher employee costs and an unfavorable swing in tax items. \n Adjusted first quarter earnings were down $1.3 billion versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings were down modestly. Higher liftings were more than offset by lower natural gas realizations. DD&A was higher due to the PDC acquisition and Permian growth. Adjusted downstream earnings were lower mainly due to lower refining margins and timing effects. \n Worldwide oil equivalent production was the highest first quarter in our company's history. Production was up over 12% from last year, including an increase of 35% in the United States largely due to the PDC Energy acquisition and organic growth in the Permian Basin. \n Looking ahead to the second quarter, we have planned turnarounds at TCO and several Gulf of Mexico assets. Following another strong quarter in the Permian, production is trending better than our previous guidance, and we now expect first half production to be down less than 2% from the fourth quarter. \n Impacts from refinery turnarounds are mostly driven by El Segundo and Richmond. We anticipate higher affiliate dividends in the second quarter largely from TCO. With the start-up of WPMP, we expect TCO's DD&A to increase by approximately $400 million over the remainder of the year. \n Share repurchases are restricted under SEC regulations through the Hess shareholder vote, after which we intend to resume buybacks at the $17.5 billion annual rate. We've published a new document with our consolidated guidance and sensitivities that will be updated quarterly and posted to our website the month prior to our earnings call. \n Back to you, Jake. \nJake Spiering: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Katie, please open the line. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. \nSam Margolin: Maybe we could start with Tengiz because there's movement there. And specifically, the effects of the WPMP start-up, if you don't mind going into some detail. I think the market understands that it's FGP phase that really rerates kind of TCO's distribution capacity. But if there's any incremental benefits from WPMP starting up, whether it's reliability or potential to produce over nameplate or even just the CapEx run rate and what it means for maybe an annualized TCO distribution at this stage, that would be very helpful. \nMichael Wirth: Yes. Sam, let me talk a little bit to the project and operational dimensions of this, and then I'll let Eimear comment on the financial ramifications of that. So look, we're really pleased with the progress that's been making and pleased that we've begun the initial start-up of WPMP with the first PBF compressor online and processing crude through the plants after conversion of the first metering station. \n It's an important milestone. I'm proud of the team and the work they've been doing. They've done this safely. We're seeing initial operation that is well aligned with our expectations. In fact, we've been encouraged by very strong production response from the wells that feed into this first metering station. We now have the second metering station planned for conversion as off-line, and that conversion is underway. And as we bring on more of the PBF compression capacity, we'll complete more metering stations over the balance of the year. \n What happens here is we get higher production because the wells are now flowing against lower back pressure. And as I said, Sam, we've seen really strong response on this first set of wells. What that does is it gives us a high degree of confidence in keeping the plants full all year long with the fact being that we've got some turnarounds we have to do. We've got an SGI turnaround and a KTL turnaround, SGI this quarter, KTL next quarter, to do some tie-ins and some other normal maintenance. But in the periods in between those, it increases deliverability and the confidence of the plant will be full throughout that period of time. \n We've got a lot of project scope operational is the other thing that I just would remind you of. We're producing from new wells. We've got upgraded to new utilities now, gathering system, a new control center, power distribution system, 2 new, big-frame 9 gas turbine generators in service. So the reliability of the infrastructure and all of the control networks and everything is significantly improved as we got more modern equipment in place. So all of this reads through to higher degree of reliability, strong production performance. \n And last year was the second strongest year in the past several. So it gives us high confidence in delivering what we've said we'll deliver there. And then as we get into the third quarter, we'll start commissioning some of the process equipment as part of FGP, which, as you say, first half start-up next year is when you see the incremental production come online. \n So good progress all the way around. I'll reiterate that schedule and cost guidance are unchanged. And we'll continue to provide details each quarter on milestones and progress as we proceed. \n Eimear, maybe you can just talk about what that means financially. \nEimear Bonner: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, Sam, well, after years of investing, as the project starts up over the next couple of years, we do expect the CapEx profile to continue to decline, and that will enable free cash flow over the next couple of years to grow. \n With WPMP, it will keep the plants full. So this will allow IBS business to generate significant cash, and that will be available for distribution. With the second phase of the project then next year in '25, TCOs free cash flow is going to grow even further because with that phase of the project, we get incremental production. \n So what does this mean for Chevron? Well, we expect $4 billion of free cash flow in 2025 and $5 billion in 2026. This is a $60 Brent. This will flow to us through a combination of dividends, so you'll see this come through cash flow from operations and loan repayments, which will flow through cash for investing. \n So we do expect dividends this year. We have guidance -- affiliate guidance to dividends for 2024. But we've also included in the deck today the outlook for affiliate dividends for the second quarter, $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And a significant portion of that is an assumption around TCO. \nOperator: We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. \nNeil Mehta: My question is really on the exploration program. Specifically, you have an interesting position in West Africa and Namibia. So maybe you can just give us some historical context of how you got involved here. Is this an asset that you see a lot of opportunity in, especially given some of the announcements from peers over the last couple of weeks? And how do you think about prosecuting it going forward? \nMichael Wirth: Yes. Thank you, Neil. We've got a nice portfolio of exploration opportunities around the world and including numerous prospects on Block 90 in the Orange Basin offshore Namibia, which lies just outshore -- outbound of where there was a recent discovery announced by another company. We're planning to spud the first exploration well in that block late this year or early next year based on rig availability. The rig will be completed in early '25. \n We farmed into another block, Block 82, which is further north in the Walvis space, and that was just announced earlier this week. And as you know, there have been a number of discoveries made by companies in the Orange Basin. Our block is on trend with those discoveries. We're encouraged by the success we see from others. And this is certainly an area where the industry has had a high -- a good batting average, a high degree of success. And we're pleased that we've got 2 blocks now offshore Namibia. And of course, we'll talk to you more as we get into the exploration program there. \nOperator: We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. \nPaul Cheng: You guys did a small deal look like on the retail marketing asset, adding over 200 stations in the Gulf Coast and West Coast. I actually don't remember. I think since you've become the head of downstream, say, call it, 20 years ago, you guys have been selling asset there. So is there a change of your view in terms of the overall strategy we made to that part of the business? And whether that -- this deal you are going to be owning the asset or that this is wholesale marketing [ drop ] network type of deal that you are acquiring? \nMichael Wirth: Yes. Thank you, Paul. As you know, I come out of that part of the business. I love talking about retail. Look, we've got 3 really strong brands around the world. Caltex internationally; in Asia, primarily; in Middle East and Africa, a little bit. Chevron and Texaco here primarily in the Americas.\n And you're right, we only own about 5% in the U.S., even less than 5% of our branded stations. So most of our business is done through large retailers and distributors. We enter into agreements of supply agreements and brand agreements with these marketers. And there are times, different mechanisms, we use to support their investments. We've done a couple of deals here in the last quarter that are substantial, that add a few hundred stations to our network. And as part of that, we advanced some cash to support their brand conversion efforts, their investment in the network and to solidify our relationship with really important customers of ours that ultimately sell on to consumers. And so you saw that consume some cash.\n It technically from an accounting standpoint doesn't get classified as capital, but we want to disclose it because it is cash. And it helps us grow our branded sales. And so it's an important part of our business. We're doing these kinds of deals all the time, Paul. They tend to be oftentimes smaller magnitude, so they don't necessarily get to a size where we would mention it the way that we did today. But we won't own these stations. They're owned by really strong independent retailers. Thanks for the question. \nOperator: We'll go next to Betty Jiang with Barclays. \nWei Jiang: Mike, just -- so we're seeing that the U.S. operations look pretty strong quarter, especially with Permian holding in better than expected relative to your expectations. Could you just talk about what drove the better performance in the Permian and how you think the rest of the year unfolds? And then just anything else within the U.S. that you want to highlight? \nMichael Wirth: Sure. So yes, first quarter production in the Permian was good, 859,000 barrels a day, down about 1% from the fourth quarter of last year, stronger than what we had anticipated. Really good, strong performance in our company-operated business, building off the momentum from the fourth quarter of last year. We have seen reliability improvements that translate into a slightly less decline in our base production.\n We saw a significantly shorter frac to POP cycle time, so between completed frac and when we put it on production. So that resulted in a few more wells being POP-ed in the first quarter, which you see in the production. Well performance itself was generally aligned with our expectations. And so we've been talking a lot about type curves the last few quarters. We're seeing strong performance that's aligned with or even a little bit stronger than what we expected.\n And then we also saw some good contributions from our royalty acreage, which is the highest-return barrels we have because we really have no investment there and it's attractive acreage. Others are developing it. And we saw increased activity that resulted in increased royalty production.\n NOJV, right on plan with what we expected and a lot of visibility into the non-operated joint venture portfolio for this year, more even than last year at this time, and confidence that, that will deliver. So all of that translated into a very strong first quarter.\n Eimear mentioned that we now expect our first half to be better than we'd previously guided. We said 2% to 4% down versus fourth quarter of last year. We now think we'll be less than 2% down. And then, of course, the back half of the year, we had another frac spread. We've got more wells online and expect to exit the year around 900,000 barrels a day. So really strong performance there and consistent with the momentum that you've seen in prior quarters.\n The -- I guess the other thing I would mention relative to the U.S. more broadly is the Anchor project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is we've guided towards midyear start-up of that. It's right on track. The floating production unit is being commissioned. As we speak, we've got both buyback gas and back oil in the facilities. So that means the pipelines, the process units are now charged with live hydrocarbons. We're commissioning some of the subsea infrastructure, including flow lines.\n The completion of the first well is in progress. Second well is drilled and will be completed shortly. Third well is being drilled right now. So we'll talk more about this, but everything is right on track for start-up of Anchor midyear. And then, of course, we've got other Gulf of Mexico projects as well that are kind of stacked up right behind Anchor over subsequent quarters. So the outlook in the U.S. is especially strong. \nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Silverstein with UBS. \nJoshua Silverstein: You had around $1 billion of debt this quarter to manage some of the working capital and really distribution timing. Do you see the cash balance growing sequentially? Did you repay the commercial paper in 2Q? Just wanted to get a sense of where the cash outlook may go sequentially. \nMichael Wirth: Eimear, why don't you take that? \nEimear Bonner: Yes. Josh, yes, so we had some commercial paper issued in the first quarter, and it was just to manage short-term liquidity. Timing of affiliate dividends can be a bit lumpy, repatriation of cash can be a bit lumpy. So this was normal business for us in the first quarter.\n I think in terms of what to expect in terms of cash on the balance sheet, I mean, we target to hold about $5 billion in cash, and that will bounce around as well. But I think $5 billion is a good number. We have access to lots of liquidity and commercial paper, bond investors, credit facilities. So while we've had higher cash in the balance sheet in the past, holding excess cash with low debt and lots of access to liquidity can be a drag in returns. So we're quite comfortable with the $5 billion cash, and that's a good number for you to focus on there. \nOperator: We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. \nBiraj Borkhataria: I wanted to ask a follow-up on the Permian. So you put out there the updated well productivity slide, which is very helpful. But a few quarters ago, Mike, you talked about some of the broader constraints in the Permian, whether it's CO2, water handling and so on. It doesn't look like it's impacted your volumes in the near term, which have performed very well. So could you just refresh us on if anything has changed in your views on that there? \nMichael Wirth: Yes. Thanks, Biraj. Nothing's really changed. I mean this is a very large base business now with thousands of wells over a very large footprint. And it's important that we focus not only on productivity, efficiency and reliability and drilling and completions, but also in all aspects of operations. And that's midstream takeaway, it's gas processing, it's water handling.\n And we've got more development underway this year in the New Mexico portion of the Delaware, which is going to require a build-out of some of this capability, which will be part of our capital program addresses. But you really have to stay on top of base business reliability on all these things. Seismic is another one we've seen some issues on.\n And so they're all part of managing the business for safety and reliability each and every day. We had a quarter -- a couple of quarters back where a number of those things were a challenge. And the current quarter, we saw really good performance.\n Last thing I might mention, which might be implied in your question, you see some talk about the takeaway capacity out of the basin and are people constrained, is that impacting particularly gas prices within the other commodities. We're covered on takeaway capacity out of the basin on oil, NGL and gas well out into the future. And so we're not exposed to any in-basin discounted pricing as a result of that. \nOperator: We'll go next to Nitin Kumar with Mizuho. \nNitin Kumar: Mike, I just wanted to maybe get an update on Venezuela. There were some reports that Biden administration is reinstating some of the export bans on that country. Specifically said that Chevron was not included, but just your thoughts on sort of the future of oil production and exports from the country and how it would impact Chevron? \nMichael Wirth: Yes. Thanks, Nitin. So you might recall that the Department of Treasury and OPEC, a division within treasury, has issued a couple of different, what are called general licenses for operations for companies in Venezuela. There's one called General License 41, which primarily pertains to our position in the country. There's some specific licenses as well that kind of go along with that. And then there had been a second one that was issued subsequently called General License 44, which applied more broadly. That's the one where the administration has announced some changes. And those don't really impact us. There have been no changes to GL 41. And so we're not really affected by the news you've read about recently.\n I'll just remind you, we're not putting new capital into Venezuela right now. All the spending is really self-funded from the cash from operations. We've been lifting oil and bringing it to the U.S., which has been helpful for the U.S. refining system, not just ours but others as well.\n And since that license was issued now a little bit more than a year ago, we've seen production at the joint ventures that we're participating in increase from about 120,000 barrels a day at the time that, that license was issued to about 180,000 barrels a day now. So that's an update. There are some -- maybe it might be worth reminding just how the financial side of that works because it's a little bit different than some of the other parts of our production. So Eimear, do you want to touch on that? \nEimear Bonner: Yes. Nitin, just as a reminder, for Venezuela, we do cost accounting, not equity accounting. So Chevron is not recording the production here or the reserves. We record earnings when we receive cash, and that shows up under other income and income statement. Just to put this into context, in 2023, the cash was modest, probably less than 2% cash flow from operations. \nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. \nJason Gabelman: I wanted to ask about the divestment program. I know when the Hess deal was announced, you discussed $10 billion to $15 billion. But given that's in a bit of a holding pattern here, I'm just wondering what you expect the cadence or the target for divestments to be. I think historically, you've done about $2 billion a year. So that's not too far from what the guidance was with the Hess deal. Just trying to try and lay those 2 numbers and getting a sense of what the divestment program could look like while that deal is in a bit of a holding pattern. If you could just remind us the assets that have been discussed in the market, that would be great. \nMichael Wirth: Yes. Yes, sure. Happy to do that, Jason. So the first thing is you're right. We're always high-grading our portfolio. And it's not because we need the cash. You already covered the strength of the balance sheet. But it's really to set value to optimize our portfolio. We find times there are things that don't compete for capital in our portfolio and they fit better with somebody else.\n They tend to be early-in-life assets. We were at Rosebank and divested that a few years ago or things that are much later in life and might fit better with somebody who works those kinds of assets.\n Over the last decade or so, 2012 through 2023, we divested about $35 billion worth. Our long-term history has been about $2 billion per year, maybe 1% of our capital employed, give or take. And our guidance for this year is 1% to 2%, so it's pretty consistent with history. We did say that upon the closure of the Hess transaction, we're going to add some assets that are going to be highly attractive for capital investment. And that means as you look through the rest of the portfolio, if we stay capital-disciplined, there are probably some things that we might otherwise have invested in that now we would choose not to. And so that's where the 10 to 15 guidance came from. That would still stand upon closure.\n The things we're doing now are things we would have done in the normal course. And so they're not really related to high-grading post the Hess addition. The things that are in the public domain, we talked about Myanmar, which we exited as of April 1. We've announced that we intend to exit the Congo, and we've got a deal there. We expect that to close before the end of the year. \n We have talked about our position in unconventionals in Canada and in Kaybob, Duvernay, which is a nice asset, which has some growth opportunities, but it may be a better fit for others. So we're looking at alternatives there. And then also the Haynesville, we paused our development activity in the Haynesville last year, and that's another one that we think may fit better with others. So I think those are the ones that are out in the public right now, Jason. \nOperator: We'll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. \nBob Brackett: Given the launch of Future Energy Fund III, can you give us a thought of what you saw success cases coming out of I and II that caused you to move to III? And maybe compare and contrast how you do it yourself in-house solar to hydrogen, for example, versus where you might see third parties to try new technologies. \nMichael Wirth: Yes. So I appreciate that. This is one that we probably haven't talked about with investors as much as some of the other parts of our business. Funds 1 and 2 were smaller, $100 million, $300 million. And they're not actually fully subscribed yet, but they're getting there, which is why we announced fund #3. We've been in the venture investing business for 1/4 of a century, so going back to the late '90s when we first set up our venture investing organization.\n And in the Future Energy Funds, which are those that are really need on energy transition themes, through Funds I and II, we've invested more than 30 companies already. We're collaborating with 250 or so other co-investors in these companies. We can serve as a pilot bed for their technology so we can help them bring things from the lab and kind of bench scale out into the real world.\n And I've visited last year, one of our carbon capture pilots in the San Joaquin Valley with a company that's got some really interesting technology to help us improve the efficiency, reduce the cost for carbon capture. And so we're looking at things like industrial decarbonization, hydrogen, emerging mobility, energy decentralization, the circular carbon economy. And what we're really looking to do is support innovation in things that we probably aren't doing within the company, within our own R&D or scale up. As you mentioned, the projects in the Permian Basin or in the San Joaquin Valley, the solar to green hydrogen is using established technologies that are well proven.\n What we're doing in our venture investing is trying to develop these new technologies, new materials, new novel ways to integrate AI and other kinds of technology systems to help solve some of these problems. And hopefully, we find things that will help our business and help the world.\n Last thing I'll say is over the 25 years, we've more than earned our money back in our return on our investment. Not every one of these companies is successful, but we've seen a lot of technologies move into our business. We've seen a lot of the companies become successful. And there's a lot of innovation going on out there. This allows us to leverage ourselves into smaller start-up innovation that we might not otherwise see. So it's been a very, very positive for us, and we're excited to announce the new fund. \nOperator: We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. \nRoger Read: Can we talk a little bit about Eastern Med? I know at one point, operations shut down. It sounds like everything is back up and running. But also you would kind of tie that into Egypt a little bit, where there's been some exploration talk and in the government trying to do some things to improve the overall investment, I guess, environment there. \nMichael Wirth: Yes, you bet. So first of all, we are back in full operations in the Eastern Med. We've -- Tamar was down for about a month at the very beginning of hostilities. But we're excited about the opportunities there. Just to remind you, we've got the 2 existing platforms, Tamar and Leviathan, in service. And we've really structured our development plans there to focus on capital efficiency, higher returns, to the earlier answer, things we've got to compete for capital in our portfolio.\n Since we've closed on the Noble acquisition, we've increased production at Tamar and Leviathan by more than 10% just through debottlenecking and reliability. We've sanctioned projects at both of those that are currently in progress that will increase production by another 40% over the next couple of years. And we're looking at larger expansion, particularly for Leviathan, where we've got a number of concepts that are being evaluated. Obviously, in the current environment, we're moving carefully with development of those.\n You mentioned Egypt. We've got a discovery at Argus. We expect another appraisal well there in late this year or early next year to better characterize the field and refine our development plan. We've got a number of other blocks that have not been drilled yet that we shot a seismic on. And we plan to spud a well in Block 4 there before the end of this year. And so it's an area that I think has got real prospectivity. As you look at growth in both the near term, with the projects I mentioned and then the longer expansion of existing and exploration prospectivity, it's a part of our portfolio that I expect us to see growth from over the coming decade. \nOperator: We'll go next to Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies. \nFrancis Lloyd Byrne: I know we've covered a lot of ground this morning. We talked about the Permian productivity, which looks really good. But could you just touch on the DJ? And that production looks stronger than we expected. And then also any political risk you might want to comment on that there? \nMichael Wirth: Sure. So yes, first quarter production in the DJ was above 400,000 barrels a day, kind of higher than what our long-term guidance is. We had timing -- a lot of fourth quarter '23 wells put on production there. You'd typically expect some weather-related downtime in Colorado over the first quarter. We saw some of that, but less than what we had planned for. So production was good.\n Second quarter, there's maybe some minimal impacts that we expect from a third-party gas plant that's had an outage. But continued strong performance there thus far in the second quarter. These are high cash margin, low-breakeven barrels that we're really pleased to have in our portfolio. If you go back 3 years ago, we didn't have anything in DJ. We were not talking 400,000 barrels a day of production there.\n We plan to hold our plateau there around 400,000 barrels a day, and it will fluctuate a little bit based on the timing of bringing new pads on and completion of wells, et cetera. But it's a really strong asset for us.\n Let me talk about the politics and kind of the operating environment a little bit, and then maybe I'll have Eimear just touch on PDC and the benefits of that. But Colorado is a state where energy is an important part of the economy. And I grew up there. The environment is very important to the people and the state as well. And I think their goal has been to be a leader in responsible development and to recognize the important economic contribution that our industry makes to the states. I'm confident that, that will continue to be the case.\n We've got good relationships with members of the legislature, with the executive branch, with the governor. And as the largest oil and gas producer in the state with over 1,000 employees who live and work there and we were a significant investor there, we engage broadly within the community. And I think there's a recognition that responsible development in Colorado is what everybody wants and what we are committed to.\n And there's -- can be some noise around ballot proposals. There can be some noise around legislative proposals. But we're confident that the state is interested in working with us to be a responsible player and for this to be an important part of the economy. Eimear, maybe PDC, some of the benefits, just so people are reminded of that. \nEimear Bonner: Yes. It's been about 9 months since we closed with PDC Energy. We're really pleased with the progress that we're seeing, the synergies. On the CapEx side, to date, we've captured $500 million, which is $100 million more than what we had initially guided to. We're also seeing capture on the OpEx side as well. So we're nearing $100 million there.\n The teams are continuing to integrate. We're bringing the best of both companies together and building a development playbook focused on optimizing returns in the basin. We're realizing strong free cash flow from these assets. So we're ahead of pace for the incremental $1 billion in annual free cash flow that we guided to. \nOperator: We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. \nDevin McDermott: I wanted to bring it back to TCO. And Mike, I think you've talked in the past about how there is some similarity in the design between [ WPMP ] and FGP as a result of that. As you bring WPMP online, it helps derisk part of the FGP ramp as well. I was wondering if you could remind us what some of that commonality is. And as you look at the milestones you look out over the next few months at WPMP, which are the ones that you think about as being key to help derisk FGP as well? \nMichael Wirth: Yes. So it's -- just to remind everybody, this is a massive field. Some of you have visited it. And FGP, the Future Growth Project, is taking things we did almost 20 years ago now with the second generation plant in sour gas injection, where we injected about half of the sour gas. And we're now injecting all the sour gas, increasing production. And at the same time, we're reducing back pressure on the field and using compression to push the production into the facilities so that we're not relying on field pressure to do that. And that increases the life and longevity of the production out of the field.\n The other thing this project brings with it is what I've described sometimes as urban renewal. And it takes infrastructure that was built back even before Kazakhstan was independent. And it brings power and utility infrastructure, control infrastructure up to modern-day technology and modern-day standards. So the projects are quite integrated.\n The start-up sequencing in terms of what you do to walk down systems, ensure they're ready for operation, do all the testing and start-up is very similar, whether you're in one portion of the project or another. And the productivity of the field resources that we see on WPMP reads across to FGP as well. And so while they're fundamentally different project scopes and objectives, so much of the work is similar across equipment and the commissioning and start-up activities that I think the positive progress we're making, the success we're seeing in commissioning and start-up at FGP reads straight -- at WPMP, reads straight across to FGP as well. \nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. \nRyan Todd: Maybe one on the renewable side of your portfolio. I mean you announced FIDs on a couple of different renewable projects, one in biofuels, one in solar to hydrogen. Can you provide some color on what underpins confidence in these specific projects, whether it's commercial or technical or regulatory support? And do you see further opportunities to develop similar projects in the portfolio going forward? Or are there specific things about these ones in particular that make them attractive? \nMichael Wirth: Yes. So the 2 projects. One is an oilseed processing plant in our joint venture with Bunge. It's a project at Destrehan, Louisiana. And so FID was announced for a new oilseed processing plant there. This one will feature a very flexible design, and that's important because it gives you feedstock flexibility, which matters in any fuels manufacturing business. So in this case, we can process soybeans and softseeds, but we can also be able to process winter oilseed crops, things like winter canola, cover crest. And so it gives us a greater range of potential feedstocks that can then feed into our renewable fuels business, particularly the Geismar real diesel project, which will start up later this year. And it's really important that we have exposure across these value chains.\n The margins can move from the crush margin into the upgrading margin or what you consider the refining margin, into the marketing margin. And just like in our traditional business, being able to catch all margin across the value chain as it moves is important. Having flexibility, scale and reliability are important. So all of those underpin the investment decision there.\n The project in California on green hydrogen is smaller in scale. And it really uses existing solar production capacity. We've got a 5-megawatt production facility in our Lost Hills oilfield in Kern County. And we're going to produce about a metric ton per day of hydrogen for retail fuel stations. So we're using existing infrastructure. We're integrating into the value chain. We've got another venture that is building hydrogen refueling facilities in California. And so we're leveraging existing assets, existing value chains and capabilities to invest here. As I say, smaller scale, and I don't want to overplay it, but it's very consistent with our strategy. And these things have got to start small and then scale. And so we're pleased with both of these.\n There are markets, maybe to your point about economics that are, in some ways, heavily influenced by government policy, be it the renewable fuel standard and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which affect renewable fuels or some of the things in the investment or the inflation reduction act that affect hydrogen. And so it makes them a little bit different than our traditional business, which really works off market fundamentals. But we look at a lot of cases there, and we invest in projects where we believe there's confidence that over time, we can generate a good return. \nOperator: We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan. \nJohn Royall: So my question is on West Coast refining. We now have one West asset producing gasoline on the West Coast, and TMX should be increasing the availability of heavy crudes once it's ramped. But it's a tough regulatory climate. And you're well positioned as one of the players that still has multiple assets in California. How are you thinking about that region today? And should we see structurally higher gasoline margins in California given we've had some capacity come out? \nMichael Wirth: Well, look, we've been in California for our entire existence, 145 years. We've got an integrated value chain that allows us to serve 2 competitive refineries and advantaged logistics that take us out into a market where we've got a very strong brand and where the demand for all forms of energy continues to grow, be it power, be it transportation fuels. It's an economy that is large and demand continues to go up.\n That said, the policy environment has been one that is geared towards reducing investment in traditional energy, encouraging investments in these lower-carbon energies. And you've seen assets go out of the system, fossil fuel-fired power plants. There's a lot of questions about the one remaining nuclear power plant in the state. And you've seen refineries close down, as you say, some permanently, some to convert to uses, including to renewable fuels. And what that does is it creates a tighter supply-demand balance, particularly as demand continues to be strong and you need to have strong operations out of that entire system or you need to bring in supplies from somewhere else if you've got planned or unplanned issues that the system is dealing with.\n And so on an average, what does that mean? It means margins are probably under more pressure. It means reliable operations are very important. And it's a place where we've operated for a long time and expect to continue to do so. But putting new investment into the state is a different question. And I think we've been pretty clear that we've got a global portfolio and we'll invest where we see the best conditions, and I wouldn't describe California that way today. \nOperator: We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi. \nAlastair Syme: Mike, can you help me understand a bit the sequencing of the base case on the Hess timetable? I've read all the documents, but just to get your sort of view. We've got a shareholder vote in May and we got limbo pending regulatory issues, but obviously, importantly, the arbitration. But maybe just talk about the arbitration timetable. \nMichael Wirth: Yes. So there are, I think, really 3 things, if you're looking at sequencing and timing here. One is the shareholder vote. And as I said, the proxy will be mailed out in April, and the shareholder vote will occur in May. You've got regulatory approval through the FTC, and we're making good progress on that. We're working closely with the FTC in respect to their role in the process and expect us to be substantially complete with that here by midyear.\n And then we have the arbitration, which is, I think, a little bit less well defined at this point. The specific scheduling and time line will be established by the arbitration tribunal. In our S-4, we indicated that Hess has asked the tribunal to hear the merits of the cases in the third quarter with an outcome in the fourth quarter, which would allow us to close the transaction shortly thereafter. We see no legitimate reason to delay that time line. It's consistent with what Exxon has outlined is what they would expect. But I can't say that's exactly how it unfolds because we haven't seen specific scheduling from the tribunal yet. \nOperator: We'll take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist. \nNeal Dingmann: My question is on broad capital spend question specifically. Could you just maybe speak to -- do you have sort of broad strokes what percent of total spend would be directed towards the New Energies and maybe the Chevron technology ventures? And I'm just wondering how you think about margins, even though it's still early for some, how the margins of these compare to your higher-return traditional margin business. \nMichael Wirth: Yes. So there's a couple of kind of broad framing points, I think, to bear in mind as you think about that. Number one is we've guided to a long-term capital spend at around $16 billion. This year, we've got $15.5 billion to $16.5 billion as a range. And we intend to be very disciplined with our capital investment and only invest in the most attractive opportunities.\n We've also indicated that over a period of time, beginning in 2022 through 2028, I think it was when we announced our -- we had our energy transition spotlight, that we expected to spend about $10 billion in our New Energies business over that period of time, $8 billion in kind of the newer -- emerging business lines of carbon capture and storage, renewable fuels and hydrogen and then another couple of billion in decarbonizing our own operations and businesses.\n It's not completely ratable. And that is a guide that we may or may not achieve. We may be a little below that, we may be a little above that, depending upon how these opportunities mature in new businesses. And to the earlier question, we need to be sure we've got confidence when we're putting capital, particularly large capital, some of the smaller things to help accelerate technology, learning, et cetera, like our venture investments, which tend to be a few millions of dollars in any particular company.\n We recognize the risk-return equation there. But larger investments, we've got to have a belief that this is a business that's going to deliver a return over time, and we're on the path to building a portfolio of businesses that will do that. And so that $10 billion is a guide, but we'll invest in things that make sense, and we'll explain the numbers if they end up a little bit different than that.\n And so what that can tell you is the majority of our spend is still going into our traditional business because the majority of the world's energy is still provided by our traditional business, and we've got an obligation to meet that demand as long as it's there. But we're going to be very disciplined in what we invest in and only invest in the highest-return opportunities. And so each year, we issue specific guidance that we can -- you can look at. But longer term, I think you have to stay within those broad parameters and expect us to remain disciplined. \nJake Spiering: We would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy.\n Katie, back to you. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Chevron's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}]}
