Based on my analysis of Merck's Q1 2014 earnings call, I forecast a positive short-term impact on the stock price for the following key reasons:

1. The company beat Q1 earnings expectations and reaffirmed full-year guidance while demonstrating strong cost control and operational discipline.

2. Management highlighted multiple near-term catalysts including pipeline progression (PD-1, HCV programs) and potential strategic actions (consumer/animal health evaluations).

3. Core franchises like Januvia, immunology, and vaccines showed solid growth despite some temporary headwinds.

The tone was confident and execution appears strong, with management emphasizing their innovation strategy and pipeline opportunities rather than defensive consolidation. While there are some challenges (patent expirations, pricing pressure), the overall message suggests positive momentum.
