Based on analyzing this earnings call transcript, I assess a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact on Merck's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

Positives:
- Solid quarterly results with strong performance in core areas like diabetes and acute care
- Successful launch of KEYTRUDA with 900 patients already being treated
- On track to achieve $2.5B cost reduction target
- $11.5B returned to shareholders over past 12 months

Negatives/Concerns:
- Some revenue decline YoY (-4%) 
- Vaccine sales declined due to timing of public sector purchases
- Currency headwinds mentioned for 2015
- Some uncertainty around ongoing clinical trials and regulatory timelines

Overall, while there are some near-term challenges, management demonstrated good execution on strategic initiatives and cost controls, with encouraging early signs from key product launches. The tone was measured but confident. The mix of positives and negatives suggests minimal stock price impact in the very short term.
