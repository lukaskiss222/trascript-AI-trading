Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Positives:
- Reaffirmed full year 2009 guidance 
- Strong expense management and cost controls
- Solid growth in key products like JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS
- Cleared majority of ZOSTAVAX backorders
- Strong balance sheet with $18B in cash

Key Negatives:
- GARDASIL guidance reduced by $300M for 2009
- Revenue likely to be in lower half of guidance range
- Continued challenges with SINGULAIR and GARDASIL in US
- Weakness in cholesterol franchise (ZETIA/VYTORIN)
- Loss of patent exclusivity impacting sales

Analysis: While Merck showed solid cost control and maintains a strong financial position, the reduced GARDASIL guidance and expectation for revenues at the lower end of guidance range will likely pressure the stock in the near-term. The continued challenges with key products like GARDASIL and SINGULAIR, along with patent losses, outweigh the positives from expense management and growth in newer products.

Rating: [-1]

The stock is likely to face modest downward pressure over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the lowered expectations for GARDASIL and overall revenues, despite the company's solid operational execution on costs.
