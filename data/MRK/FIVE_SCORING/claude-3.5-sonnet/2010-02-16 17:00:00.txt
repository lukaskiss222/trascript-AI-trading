Based on my analysis of this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly positive short-term impact on Merck's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong operational performance with growth across multiple key products like JANUVIA, SINGULAIR and ISENTRESS, suggesting solid business momentum post-merger.

2. Management expressed confidence in achieving $3.5B in net merger synergies by 2012, with about two-thirds of 2010 synergies coming in H2.

3. While 2010 faces some headwinds (patent losses, integration costs), management reaffirmed long-term high single-digit EPS growth targets and margin expansion goals.

However, my optimism is somewhat tempered by:
- Patent losses for major products in 2010 (Cozaar/Hyzaar)
- High R&D spending levels being maintained
- Back-end loaded earnings for 2010

On balance, the strong execution, merger synergy potential, and management's confident tone should drive modestly positive sentiment in the near-term.
