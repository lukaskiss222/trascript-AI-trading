Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slight positive short-term impact on Merck's stock price for the following reasons:

1. Strong launch performance of new products, particularly Gardasil ($155M in Q4) and Januvia ($42M in Q4), demonstrating successful commercialization execution

2. Management reaffirmed full-year 2007 guidance and long-term growth targets, showing confidence in their business outlook

3. Core business fundamentals remain solid with 3% full-year revenue growth despite major patent expiration (Zocor)

However, there are some moderating factors:
- Increased legal defense reserves for VIOXX litigation
- Higher than anticipated SG&A spending
- Sequential flattening of equity income

On balance, the strong new product momentum and maintained guidance should provide modest upward momentum in the near-term.
