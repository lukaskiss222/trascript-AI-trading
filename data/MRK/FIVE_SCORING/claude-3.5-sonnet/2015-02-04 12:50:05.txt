Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Merck's stock price for the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong execution in core areas (diabetes, vaccines, hospital acute care) with underlying business growth despite FX headwinds

2. Multiple near-term catalysts including KEYTRUDA lung cancer filing mid-2015 and HCV filing in H1 2015

3. Solid Q4 results with EPS at high end of guidance and cost control initiatives on track

4. Management's confident tone regarding commercial momentum and pipeline progress

While there are some headwinds like FX impact and Remicade biosimilar competition in Europe, the overall message suggests strong underlying business performance and multiple growth drivers ahead. Management demonstrated clear strategic focus and ability to execute.
