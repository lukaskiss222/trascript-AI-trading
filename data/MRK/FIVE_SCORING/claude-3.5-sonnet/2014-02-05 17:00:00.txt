Based on the earnings call transcript, Merck presented mixed signals but with several positive indicators. While the company expects 2014 to be a trough year for earnings, management expressed confidence in growth resuming in 2015. Key positives include:

1. Strong pipeline progress, particularly with MK3475 (immunotherapy) and multiple promising collaborations
2. Cost reduction initiatives on track, with $1.3B in savings already achieved
3. Eight of top 10 brands growing double digits
4. Strategic portfolio optimization underway

However, some challenges exist:
- Pricing pressures internationally
- Patent expirations impacting revenues
- Gross margin pressure from product mix shift

Given management's confident tone about future growth, strategic initiatives showing results, and strong pipeline developments (especially in oncology), I anticipate a modestly positive short-term market reaction.
