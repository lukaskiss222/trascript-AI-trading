Based on this earnings call transcript, I assess that the short-term stock impact will be positive, though modestly so. Here's my reasoning:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q1 results with revenues of $11.4B and non-GAAP EPS of $0.83, beating expectations
- Merger integration progressing well with synergies on track
- Strong performance across multiple key brands (JANUVIA, SINGULAIR, REMICADE)
- Management reaffirmed long-term guidance

Some Concerns:
- Guidance implies weaker quarters ahead after Q1 benefits from inventory build and FX
- Patent expiry impact from COZAAR/HYZAAR will increase
- Healthcare reform will have near-term negative revenue impact
- European pricing pressures noted

Overall, while there are some headwinds, the strong Q1 execution, reaffirmed guidance, and progress on integration should provide modest upward momentum to the stock in the very near-term.
