Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a modestly positive short-term impact on Merck's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include:

- Strong Q2 results with sustained momentum in key products like JANUVIA, ISENTRESS, and REMICADE
- Good progress on merger integration and cost synergies 
- Successful product launches in key markets like Japan
- Maintained full year guidance midpoint despite headwinds
- Continued share repurchases and dividend returns

Some offsetting factors:
- European pricing pressures expected to impact H2 2020
- ZOSTAVAX supply constraints
- Some new product launches (SAPHRIS) underperforming expectations

Overall, the company demonstrated solid execution while maintaining guidance despite new headwinds. Management's confident tone and continued shareholder returns should provide support for the stock in the near-term.
