Based on analyzing Merck's Q4 2011 earnings call, I predict a positive short-term impact on the stock price for the following reasons:

1. Strong Q4 and full year 2011 performance with 4% revenue growth and 10% EPS growth, demonstrating operational momentum heading into 2012.

2. Management expressed confidence in maintaining 2012 revenues near 2011 levels despite SINGULAIR patent expiry, supported by growth in key products like JANUVIA and emerging markets.

3. Continued cost discipline and synergy realization while making strategic investments, with an 11% dividend increase signaling confidence in future performance.

While there are some headwinds from FX and patent expiries, the overall tone was optimistic and results/guidance were solid enough to likely drive positive sentiment.
