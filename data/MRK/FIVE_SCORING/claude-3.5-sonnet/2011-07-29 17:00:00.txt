Based on my analysis of the earnings transcript, here are the key points driving my short-term stock outlook:

Positive factors:
- Strong Q2 performance with 7% revenue growth and 10% non-GAAP EPS growth
- Announced additional $1.3-1.5B in cost savings through 2015
- Successful launches of multiple products including VICTRELIS
- Continued strong growth in emerging markets, especially China (+30%)

Negative factors:
- Discontinuation of telcagepant development program
- Manufacturing issues impacting JANUMET XR and ZOSTAVAX supply
- Some uncertainty around VICTRELIS launch trajectory vs competitor
- Additional restructuring/job cuts signal ongoing challenges

Conclusion: The solid quarterly performance and significant new cost savings initiatives should provide positive momentum in the near-term, though tempered somewhat by product setbacks. Management appeared confident in their growth strategy and ability to execute. The cost restructuring announcement in particular should be well-received by investors looking for margin expansion.
