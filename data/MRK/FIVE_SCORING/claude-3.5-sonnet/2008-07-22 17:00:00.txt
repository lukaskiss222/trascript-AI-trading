Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on Merck's stock price for the following reasons:

1. The company suspended its EPS guidance due to uncertainty around SEAS trial results for ZETIA/VYTORIN, signaling potential risks to a key product franchise.

2. GARDASIL sales guidance was cut significantly ($500M reduction) due to penetration challenges in key age groups and adverse event publicity.

3. SINGULAIR guidance was lowered by $200M due to competitive pressures and safety concerns.

While there were some positives (cost control, strong JANUVIA performance), the suspension of guidance and multiple product revenue downgrades are likely to create near-term selling pressure as investors digest the increased uncertainty.
