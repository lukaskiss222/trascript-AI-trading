Based on this earnings call transcript, I assess that this will likely have a short-term POSITIVE impact on Merck's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. Strong Q1 performance with revenue growth across all major business segments and 8% EPS growth, demonstrating operational execution ahead of SINGULAIR patent expiry

2. Management expressed confidence in maintaining 2012 revenues near 2011 levels despite known headwinds, and reaffirmed full year guidance

3. Pipeline progress highlighted with 5-6 major filings expected through 2013, including promising late-stage assets like odanacatib and Suvorexant

The tone was notably positive with management emphasizing sustainable growth and expressing confidence in both near-term execution and long-term pipeline potential.
