Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess a positive short-term outlook for Merck's stock based on several key factors:

1. Solid Q2 performance with 3% revenue growth (excluding FX) and improved gross margins
2. Strong double-digit growth in key products like Singulair, Januvia, Janumet and Isentress
3. Reaffirmed full year guidance and expectations for stronger second half performance
4. Progress on Schering-Plough merger integration which is expected to close in Q4
5. Management's confident tone about growth prospects and expense management

While there are some headwinds like FX impact and slower vaccine sales, the core business appears healthy with good momentum in key products. The pending Schering-Plough merger also provides a near-term catalyst.
