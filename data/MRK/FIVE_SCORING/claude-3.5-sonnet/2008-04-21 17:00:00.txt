Based on the detailed Q1 earnings call transcript, Merck delivered relatively solid results despite challenges with VYTORIN/ZETIA sales following the ENHANCE trial controversy. Key positives include:

- Reaffirmed 2008 non-GAAP EPS guidance despite headwinds
- Strong performance from newer products like JANUVIA, GARDASIL, and ISENTRESS
- International business grew 12%
- Effective cost management and manufacturing efficiency improvements

Key negatives include:

- Reduced equity income guidance by $700M due to VYTORIN/ZETIA sales decline
- Loss of FOSAMAX exclusivity 
- Uncertainty around VYTORIN/ZETIA's long-term market position

Management appeared confident in their ability to navigate challenges while executing their long-term strategy. The stock is likely to see modest positive movement in the next 1-2 weeks given the reaffirmed guidance and generally solid execution despite headwinds.
