Based on my analysis of the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on Merck's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. The key concerning factors are:

1. The withdrawal of long-term 2013 EPS guidance, which was previously reaffirmed just last quarter, signals reduced confidence in meeting prior growth targets. This is likely to shake investor confidence.

2. While Q4 results were solid, management indicated increased headwinds in 2011 from European pricing pressure, higher healthcare reform costs, and pipeline setbacks (particularly vorapaxar).

3. The company's decision to reinvest cost savings rather than flow them to the bottom line suggests near-term earnings pressure, with 2011 EPS guidance below consensus despite higher revenue expectations.

While there were some positives like strong emerging markets growth and good momentum in key products, the removal of long-term targets and increased investment spending is likely to overshadow these factors in the short-term as investors digest the implications.
