Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess a moderately negative short-term impact on Merck's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key factors:

Negatives:
- Lowered 2008 guidance to low end of range and reduced 2010 long-term revenue growth guidance
- Manufacturing issues impacting vaccine supply/availability (Zostavax, ProQuad)
- Announced major restructuring with 7,200 job cuts, suggesting cost pressures
- Challenges with key products like GARDASIL, SINGULAIR, and Vytorin/Zetia JV

Positives:
- Still expecting growth from newer products like Januvia/Janumet
- Strong international performance (+13% growth)
- Conservative financial position with $19B cash/investments
- Cost cutting could improve margins longer-term

While there are some bright spots, the guidance cuts and operational challenges are likely to pressure the stock in the near-term as investors digest the implications.
