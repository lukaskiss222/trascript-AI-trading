Based on the earnings call transcript, I would give this a neutral to slightly negative rating for short-term stock impact. Here's my rationale:

Positives:
- Strong vaccine and immunology business performance
- Breakthrough designations for key pipeline assets (PD1 and HCV)
- Cost management initiatives underway

Negatives:
- Concerning weakness in key Januvia franchise in US market (-8% decline)
- Manufacturing/regulatory challenges mentioned by R&D head
- Animal health business headwinds
- Conservative tone regarding near-term growth

While there are some encouraging long-term pipeline developments, the near-term pressures on core franchises like Januvia and manufacturing execution concerns are likely to weigh on sentiment in the 1-2 week timeframe.
