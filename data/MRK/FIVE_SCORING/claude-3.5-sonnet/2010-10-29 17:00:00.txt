Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Merck's stock price. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong operational performance despite headwinds:
- Solid revenue growth from key products (JANUVIA, SINGULAIR, ISENTRESS)
- Successfully managing through COZAAR/HYZAAR patent loss
- On track with merger synergies and cost savings

2. Positive forward guidance:
- Raised lower end of 2010 EPS guidance
- Reaffirmed high single-digit EPS growth target through 2013
- Strong pipeline progress with multiple late-stage assets

3. Management confidence:
- Clear articulation of strategy
- Strong defense of REMICADE arbitration position
- Multiple growth drivers identified across portfolio

While there are some minor concerns (gross margin pressure, European austerity measures), the overall tone and substance of the call suggests continued momentum and execution.
