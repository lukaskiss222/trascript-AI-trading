Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Merck's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. Strong Q1 2011 performance with double-digit EPS growth, cost controls, and successful integration progress, beating expectations 

2. Management raised full-year 2011 EPS guidance despite absorbing an arbitration settlement impact, showing underlying strength

3. Clear execution on growth strategy with successful product launches, emerging market expansion, and pipeline advancement (including unanimous FDA panel support for boceprevir)

The tone was confident and detailed, demonstrating strong operational execution while making strategic moves to drive future growth. Management's announcement of a new $5B share buyback also signals confidence in the company's outlook.
