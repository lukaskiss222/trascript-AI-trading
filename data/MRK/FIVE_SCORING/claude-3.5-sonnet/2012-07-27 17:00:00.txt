Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a mild positive impact on Merck's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

- Strong Q2 performance with 1% revenue growth (5% ex-FX) and 11% non-GAAP EPS growth
- Maintained full year guidance despite FX headwinds
- Positive pipeline updates, particularly for Odanacatib osteoporosis drug which had trial stopped early for efficacy
- Strong performance of core franchises like JANUVIA family (+33%) and vaccines
- Management demonstrated solid operational execution and cost control

However, some caution is warranted due to:
- Imminent SINGULAIR patent expiry in August 2012
- Increasing European austerity measures impacting pricing
- Significant FX headwinds expected in H2 2012

On balance, the strong operational performance and pipeline progress outweigh the near-term headwinds.
