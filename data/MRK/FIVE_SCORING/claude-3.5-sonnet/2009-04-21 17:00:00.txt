Based on the earnings call transcript, I analyze the following key points impacting Merck's near-term stock outlook:

Positive factors:
- Maintained full-year EPS guidance despite Q1 challenges
- Strong growth in newer products like Januvia, Janumet and Isentress
- Cost control and reduced expense guidance
- Progress on Schering-Plough merger integration
- Stable credit rating maintained

Negative factors:
- Q1 revenue missed expectations, leading to reduced full-year revenue guidance
- Significant wholesaler inventory destocking
- Continued weakness in Gardasil sales
- Delay of telcagepant migraine drug filing
- Foreign exchange headwinds impacting results

Looking ahead 1-2 weeks, the negatives seem to outweigh the positives. The revenue guidance cut and pipeline setback are likely to pressure the stock in the near-term, even though longer-term prospects remain intact. Management's tone was cautiously optimistic but acknowledged near-term challenges.

Rating: [-1] (Negative impact expected over next 1-2 weeks)
