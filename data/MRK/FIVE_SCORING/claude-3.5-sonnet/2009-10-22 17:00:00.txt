Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a modestly positive short-term impact on Merck's stock price. Key positives include: strong Q3 performance with 13% EPS growth, raised full-year guidance, positive momentum in key products like JANUVIA and ISENTRESS, and progress on the Schering-Plough merger integration. Management expressed confidence in launch opportunities and synergy capture, though noted these benefits would be more weighted to H2 2010. While there are some near-term challenges like declining GARDASIL sales and VYTORIN/ZETIA stabilization, the overall tone was constructive with multiple growth drivers highlighted.
