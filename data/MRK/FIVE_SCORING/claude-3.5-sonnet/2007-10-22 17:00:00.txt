Based on this earnings transcript, Merck delivered a very strong quarter with several positive indicators:

Key Positives:
- Raised full year EPS guidance 
- Strong revenue growth of 12.3%
- Successful vaccine portfolio performance (GARDASIL, ROTATEQ)
- Solid uptake of new products like JANUVIA
- Healthy margins and cost controls
- Pipeline progress and regulatory approvals
- Management confident in long-term growth targets

Minor Concerns:
- Some sequential flattening in GARDASIL US sales
- Ongoing VIOXX litigation costs, though manageable
- Competition expected in some key areas

The overall tone was very positive with management expressing confidence in both near-term performance and long-term growth targets. The company appears to be executing well across commercial, operational and R&D initiatives.

Given the strong results, raised guidance, and management's confident outlook, I expect this earnings report to have a positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
