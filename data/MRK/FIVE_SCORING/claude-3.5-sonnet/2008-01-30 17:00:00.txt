Based on the earnings call transcript, Merck delivered strong Q4 and full-year 2007 results but faces some key headwinds in 2008. While the company reaffirmed guidance and showed good performance across most products, there are concerns about VYTORIN/ZETIA following the ENHANCE trial controversy, upcoming FOSAMAX patent expiry, and vaccine sales fluctuations. Management appeared confident but acknowledged challenges ahead. The tone suggests steady performance but increased uncertainty in the near-term.
