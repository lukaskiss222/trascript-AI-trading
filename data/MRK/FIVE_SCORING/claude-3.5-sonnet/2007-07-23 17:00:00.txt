Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock impact:

Positive factors:
- Strong Q2 results with EPS of $0.82 beating expectations
- Raised full year 2007 EPS guidance to $3.00-$3.10
- Robust growth across key products (SINGULAIR, JANUVIA, GARDASIL)
- Healthy gross margins at 76.5% (excluding restructuring)

Concerns:
- Sequential decline in US GARDASIL sales
- Higher R&D expenses expected in Q3
- Ongoing VIOXX litigation risks
- Questions about vaccine manufacturing issues

Overall, the results and guidance were quite positive, with strong fundamental performance across most metrics. The raised guidance suggests management has confidence in the business momentum. While there are some near-term concerns around GARDASIL and expenses, the overall tone was optimistic and supportive of the stock.
