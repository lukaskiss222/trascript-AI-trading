Merck reported a slight revenue decline in Q3 but demonstrated strong growth in its Animal Health and Oncology segments, particularly with KEYTRUDA surpassing $1 billion in sales. The raised full-year guidance and positive outlook on key growth drivers offset concerns from pricing pressures and cyber-related setbacks, suggesting confidence in sustained performance. Overall, the positive indicators are likely to support the stock in the short term.
