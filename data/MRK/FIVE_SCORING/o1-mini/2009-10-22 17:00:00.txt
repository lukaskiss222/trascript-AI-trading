Merck reported strong third-quarter results with a 2% revenue increase and a 13% rise in non-GAAP EPS, surpassing expectations. The raised guidance and positive product performance, coupled with progress on the merger with Schering-Plough, indicate confidence in near-term growth. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock in the short term.
