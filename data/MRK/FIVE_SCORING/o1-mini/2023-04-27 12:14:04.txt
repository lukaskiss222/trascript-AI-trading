Merck's Q1 earnings highlight significant growth in key areas such as oncology and vaccines, with KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL showing robust sales increases. The raised and narrowed revenue and EPS guidance, along with strategic acquisitions and a strong pipeline, indicate positive short-term momentum. Management's confident outlook and strategic initiatives are likely to bolster investor sentiment in the coming weeks.
