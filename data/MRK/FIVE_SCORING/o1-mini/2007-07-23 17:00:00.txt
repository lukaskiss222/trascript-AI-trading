Merck reported strong second-quarter results with significant sales growth in key products such as GARDASIL and JANUVIA, and raised full-year EPS guidance. Management's optimistic tone and strategic initiatives, including new product launches and cost-saving measures, suggest confidence in continued performance. These factors are likely to drive a positive short-term reaction in the stock.
