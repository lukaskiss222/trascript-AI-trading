Merck reported strong third-quarter results, surpassing consensus expectations with robust sales from key products like Vytorin, Zetia, and Gardasil. The company also raised its full-year EPS guidance despite increased legal reserves for Vioxx, indicating confidence in its strategic initiatives and product pipeline. Management's positive outlook and demonstrated ability to exceed expectations are likely to bolster investor sentiment in the short term.
