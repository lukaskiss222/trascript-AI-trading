Merck reported solid first-quarter results with increased revenue guidance and reaffirmed full-year EPS projections, highlighting strong performance in key product areas like GARDASIL and JANUVIA. While the reduction in equity income from the joint venture presents some headwinds, the overall positive guidance and substantial share repurchase program are likely to bolster investor confidence. Managementâ€™s proactive cost-saving measures and strategic growth initiatives further support a favorable short-term outlook for the stock.
