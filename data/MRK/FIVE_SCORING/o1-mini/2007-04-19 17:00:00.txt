Merck reported strong first-quarter results, exceeding its own expectations with significant sales growth across all product lines, particularly in vaccines and new product launches like GARDASIL and JANUVIA. The raised full-year EPS guidance and positive management tone suggest investor confidence, likely driving the stock to rally in the short term.
