Merck reported a slight revenue decline but achieved a 10% growth in non-GAAP EPS excluding foreign exchange, and raised its 2016 EPS guidance. Management remains optimistic about key products like KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER despite some challenges. The positive guidance and growth prospects are likely to outweigh short-term concerns, supporting a modest positive impact on the stock.
