Based on the transcript, Merck & Co., Inc. reported strong third-quarter financial results, driven by growth in key global pharmaceutical brands and a 2% year-over-year revenue increase. The company also provided guidance for the full year, expecting non-GAAP EPS to range from $3.20 to $3.30 per share. The merger with Schering-Plough is expected to close in the fourth quarter, and the combined company is expected to have a high single-digit non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013. The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the merger's uncertainty and the need for regulatory approvals. However, the company's strong financial performance and the potential for growth in emerging markets, biologics, and vaccines suggest long-term potential.
