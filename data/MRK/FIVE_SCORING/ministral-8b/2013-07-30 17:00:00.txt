### Analysis

The earnings call for Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) provided a mixed outlook for the company. While the company reported a solid quarter with record sales, the reduced revenue guidance for 2013, driven by foreign exchange impacts and other factors, suggests a challenging environment. The company continues to manage expenses and has committed to returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks. The focus on innovation and R&D, particularly in areas like PD-1, is a positive signal, but the company's ability to execute on these programs remains to be seen. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the reduced guidance and uncertainties around key products and markets.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the reduced revenue guidance and uncertainties around key products and markets. The company's focus on innovation and cost management is a positive sign, but the execution of these strategies will be crucial for the stock's performance.
