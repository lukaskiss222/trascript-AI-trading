Based on the earnings transcript, Acceleron Pharma reported strong progress in their clinical trials and pipeline, particularly for luspatercept and ACE-083. The company exceeded enrollment targets for the MEDALIST and BELIEVE trials, and they are on track to report top-line results for these trials in mid-2018. The company also outlined plans for new trials, including COMMANDS and BEYOND, and provided updates on their muscle program, ACE-083.

The financial results were mixed, with a net loss due to increased SG&A expenses and R&D costs. However, the company expects to have sufficient cash to fund their projected operating requirements into the second-half of 2017.

Overall, the earnings call provided positive news about Acceleron Pharma's clinical pipeline and growth prospects. The stock is likely to react positively to this news, particularly if the company continues to make progress in their clinical trials and pipeline.
