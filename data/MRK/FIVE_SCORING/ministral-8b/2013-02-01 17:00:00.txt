### Analysis

The earnings call for Merck & Co. revealed a strong performance in 2012 despite several challenges, including patent expirations and market austerity. The company managed to maintain its top line and return over $7.5 billion to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. Key growth drivers such as Januvia, Gardasil, and Zostavax performed well, while emerging markets, particularly China, showed significant growth. The company also made progress in its R&D pipeline with several new drug applications and business development transactions. However, the outlook for 2013 was tempered by expected patent expirations and macroeconomic challenges. The guidance for 2013 was relatively cautious, with sales expected to be near 2012 levels on a constant currency basis.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. However, the company's strong performance in 2012 and continued focus on growth drivers suggest long-term potential.
