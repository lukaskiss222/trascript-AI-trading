### Analysis:

**Short-term Implications:**

1. **Delayed SEAS Results:** Merck's decision to delay providing 2008 equity income and EPS guidance due to the recent SEAS study results introduces uncertainty. This could lead to short-term volatility in the stock price as investors await more clarity.

2. **GARDASIL Sales:** The reduced guidance for GARDASIL sales, particularly the decrease in the 19 to 26-year old cohort, could negatively impact investor sentiment. The company's plan to address this issue through various programs may not immediately translate into increased sales.

3. **SINGULAIR Performance:** The sales decline in the U.S. due to the switch of ZYRTEC to OTC and the impact of the FDA early communication could continue to pressure SINGULAIR sales in the short term. The company's efforts to support the brand may not yield immediate results.

4. **Operational Costs:** The company's plan to reduce the size of its U.S. sales force and ongoing cost-cutting measures could lead to short-term disruptions in operations but are expected to improve long-term efficiency.

**External/Macro Influences:**

1. **Regulatory Uncertainty:** The ongoing regulatory review of SINGULAIR and the potential impact of the SEAS study results on ZETIA and VYTORIN could introduce additional uncertainty.

2. **Market Conditions:** The overall pharmaceutical market conditions, including competition and pricing pressures, may impact Merck's ability to drive revenue growth in the short term.

### Conclusion:

The short-term impact on Merck's stock price is likely to be negative due to the delayed guidance, reduced GARDASIL sales, and ongoing uncertainty around regulatory reviews. The stock may experience volatility as investors await more clarity on the SEAS results and the company's plans to address GARDASIL sales. The company's operational cost-cutting measures and strategic initiatives may not immediately translate into improved financial performance.
