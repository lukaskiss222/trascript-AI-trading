**Analysis:**

Merck's Q2 2018 earnings call revealed a strong performance, with notable growth in both Human Health and Animal Health businesses. The company's oncology portfolio, particularly KEYTRUDA, showed significant growth, with increased adoption in various tumor types. The vaccines business, led by GARDASIL, also demonstrated strong performance, with growing demand worldwide. However, the company faced challenges with pricing pressures in the U.S. and delays in regulatory approvals for some products. The management team expressed confidence in the long-term growth potential of the company's portfolio, but also acknowledged the need for continued investment in R&D and commercialization efforts.

**Conclusion:**

The stock price of Merck is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term (1â€“2 weeks) due to the strong earnings report and the company's long-term growth prospects. The management's confidence in the company's portfolio and the potential for further regulatory approvals and market penetration of KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL are likely to be positively received by investors. However, the pricing pressures in the U.S. and the need for continued investment in R&D may also present some short-term challenges.
