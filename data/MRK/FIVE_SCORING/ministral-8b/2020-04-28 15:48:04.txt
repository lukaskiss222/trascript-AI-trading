### Analysis

**Short-Term Implications (1-2 Weeks):**
- **Stock Price Impact:** The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lowered 2020 guidance, especially in the second quarter. The reduced forecast for revenues and earnings per share (EPS) is a significant concern for investors.
- **Market Sentiment:** Investors may be cautious about Merck's ability to navigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the near term. The company's focus on physician-administered products and the impact of social distancing measures on patient access are key factors.
- **Guidance:** The updated guidance for the year, which includes a decrease in expected revenues and EPS, is likely to cause a sell-off in the stock. The impact from reduced patient access and social distancing measures is expected to be most acute in the second quarter.

**Conclusion:**
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the lowered guidance and the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on patient access and demand for Merck's products. The stock is expected to face pressure in the coming weeks.
