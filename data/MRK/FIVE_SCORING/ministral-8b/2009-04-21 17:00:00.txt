**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Merck & Co., Inc. provided a mixed picture for the company's performance in Q1 2009. While the company reported $5.4 billion in revenue, which was down 8% year-over-year, the non-GAAP EPS was $0.74, which was in line with expectations. The call highlighted several challenges, including the impact of the economic downturn on sales, the loss of marketing exclusivity for some products, and challenges in the vaccine business. However, management also noted encouraging signs in the market share data for some products and expressed optimism about the company's long-term prospects.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's revenue guidance for the year was reduced, but the EPS guidance remained unchanged. The management's optimism about the company's long-term prospects and the potential benefits of the merger with Schering-Plough may provide a boost to the stock price. However, the challenges in the current quarter and the uncertainty around the merger may also weigh on the stock price.

**Rating:** 0
