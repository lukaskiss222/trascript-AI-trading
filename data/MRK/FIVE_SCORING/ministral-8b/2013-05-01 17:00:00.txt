### Analysis:
Merck's earnings call for Q1 2013 revealed a challenging environment with significant pressures from patent expirations, foreign exchange fluctuations, and increased competition. Despite these challenges, the company maintained its focus on driving shareholder value through cost-cutting measures, increased share repurchases, and strategic expansion. Key areas of focus included the JANUVIA franchise, where the company remains confident in the growth opportunities despite short-term pressures. The company also highlighted its strong pipeline of products under regulatory review, including SUVOREXANT and SUGAMMADEX, which are expected to drive future growth. Additionally, the company's strategic partnerships, such as the collaboration with Pfizer on the SGLT2 inhibitor ERTUGLIFLOZIN, demonstrate its commitment to leveraging external opportunities to enhance its product portfolio.

### Conclusion:
Given the significant pressures on the business, particularly from patent expirations and foreign exchange fluctuations, Merck's stock is likely to face short-term downward pressure. However, the company's focus on cost management, strategic partnerships, and its strong pipeline of products under regulatory review suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
