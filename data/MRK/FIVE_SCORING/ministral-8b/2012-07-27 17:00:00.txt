Based on the earnings transcript, Merck & Co., Inc. reported strong financial performance in the second quarter of 2012, with top-line growth and significant progress in their R&D pipeline. The company's strategy of focusing on innovation, execution, and geographic expansion appears to be paying off. However, there are some challenges, including foreign exchange pressures and the loss of exclusivity for SINGULAIR in the United States. Additionally, the company is facing pricing pressures in certain markets, but they are confident in their ability to maintain their revenue levels.

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the loss of exclusivity for SINGULAIR in the United States and the uncertainty around the impact of foreign exchange rates. However, the company's strong operational performance and progress in R&D suggest long-term potential. The stock may rally in the short term if the company can maintain its momentum and navigate the challenges it faces.
