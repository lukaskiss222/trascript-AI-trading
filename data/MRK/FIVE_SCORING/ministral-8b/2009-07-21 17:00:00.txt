**Analysis:**

Merck & Co., Inc.'s Q2 2009 earnings call provided a mixed picture. The company reported solid revenue growth of 3% (excluding foreign exchange), driven by strong performance in key products like Singulair, Januvia, Janumet, and Isentress. However, there were concerns about the slowing of Vytorin sales outside the U.S. and the impact of ARBITER 6 on the cholesterol franchise. The company also faced challenges with vaccine supply and inventory levels, particularly for Zostavax. The merger with Schering-Plough remains on track, with the deal expected to close in Q4 2009. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance, expecting stronger sales in the second half of the year due to normal seasonality and increased promotional efforts for vaccines and key brands.

**Conclusion:**

The call suggests a mixed outlook for Merck's stock in the short term. While the company reported solid earnings and maintained its guidance, the challenges with Vytorin sales, vaccine supply, and the impact of ARBITER 6 could weigh on the stock. The merger with Schering-Plough, however, could provide long-term growth opportunities. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the mixed results and uncertainties around key products.
