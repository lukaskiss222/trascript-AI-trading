### Analysis

Merck's Q4 and full-year 2008 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. The company achieved solid financial performance, with a 1% decline in full-year revenue to $23.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.42. However, the company faced challenges with several key products, including GARDASIL and SINGULAIR, which saw significant declines. The company also provided guidance for 2009, projecting sales of $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion and EPS of $3.15 to $3.30. Despite these challenges, Merck's management expressed confidence in their ability to drive growth through strategic initiatives and cost-cutting measures.

### Short-term Implications

1. **Key Products Performance**: GARDASIL and SINGULAIR experienced significant declines in sales. The company expects to see a step-up in GARDASIL sales in the coming quarters due to patients returning for their second and third doses. However, the company did not provide specific guidance on the quarter-to-quarter patterns for these products.
2. **Cost-cutting Measures**: Merck has been aggressive in its cost-cutting efforts, with plans to reduce its workforce and streamline operations. The company expects to realize significant savings from these efforts, which will help to offset any declines in revenue.
3. **Strategic Initiatives**: Merck's management expressed confidence in their ability to drive growth through strategic initiatives, including the rollout of a new commercial model and the pursuit of strategic acquisitions. The company's focus on cost-cutting and strategic growth suggests that it is well-positioned to navigate the current economic environment.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on Merck's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. While the company faced challenges with several key products, its solid financial performance and aggressive cost-cutting measures suggest that it is well-positioned to navigate the current economic environment. The company's focus on strategic growth and cost-cutting measures also suggests that it is well-positioned to drive growth in the coming quarters.
