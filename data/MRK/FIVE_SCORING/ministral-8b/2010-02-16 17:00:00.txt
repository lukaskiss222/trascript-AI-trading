**Analysis:**
Merck & Co. reported strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2009, with sales of $10.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79. The company's results were driven by the inclusion of legacy Schering-Plough sales, strong sales from JANUVIA, SINGULAIR, and ISENTRESS, and the launch of new products like SAPHRIS and SIMPONI. The company also announced a new multi-phased global restructuring program designed to integrate and further optimize its operations and cost structure to support its goal of becoming the best healthcare company in the world.

**Short-term (1â€“2 weeks) implications:**
- **Positive:** The strong performance in the fourth quarter and the announcement of a restructuring program to optimize operations and cost structure suggest that Merck is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory.
- **Neutral:** The company's guidance for 2010 indicates that the first half of the year may be challenging due to the loss of patent protection for Cozaar/Hyzaar and TEMODAR, as well as the expected pull-back in trade inventory levels for these products. However, the company expects to see significant synergies in the second half of the year, which could offset these challenges.
- **Negative:** The company's focus on cost-cutting and restructuring may lead to temporary job losses and potential disruptions in operations. Additionally, the loss of patent protection for Cozaar/Hyzaar and TEMODAR could lead to a decrease in sales and earnings in the first half of 2010.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral, as the company's strong performance in the fourth quarter and the announcement of a restructuring program to optimize operations and cost structure suggest that Merck is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory. However, the expected challenges in the first half of 2010 due to the loss of patent protection for Cozaar/Hyzaar and TEMODAR could lead to temporary volatility in the stock price. The company's long-term growth prospects remain positive, as indicated by its focus on innovation and strategic growth areas.
