**Analysis:**

Merck's Q3 2008 earnings call presented a mixed picture. The company reported strong sales for Januvia, Janumet, and Isentress, but faced challenges with vaccines and other products. The most notable issue was the delayed availability of vaccines due to manufacturing issues, which led to a reduction in sales and a reassessment of future growth. The company also announced a new restructuring program aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency. This program is expected to save $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion over the next five years, with $1.6 billion to $2 billion in costs incurred by the end of 2011. Despite these challenges, Merck remains committed to its long-term strategy and believes that its restructuring efforts will help drive future growth.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Merck's stock is likely to be negative due to the reduced guidance and manufacturing issues. However, the company's long-term strategy and restructuring efforts may provide a catalyst for growth and recovery in the coming quarters. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure, but investors should keep an eye on the company's progress in addressing manufacturing issues and implementing its restructuring program.

**Rating:** -1
