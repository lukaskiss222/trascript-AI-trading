Based on the earnings call transcript, Merck & Co. reported a solid first quarter with revenue of $5.8 billion, a 1% increase year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.89, excluding certain items. The company reaffirmed its 2008 financial guidance despite challenges such as the loss of patent protection for FOSAMAX and a decline in the expected sales from its Merck/Schering-Plough joint venture. Key drivers of revenue growth include GARDASIL, JANUVIA, JANUMET, and ISENTRESS. The company also highlighted its progress in implementing a new commercial model and cost-cutting measures. The stock market is likely to react positively to the company's solid performance and reaffirmed guidance, given the challenging industrial environment.
