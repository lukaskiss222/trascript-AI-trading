Based on the transcript, Merck & Co., Inc. reported strong financial results for the third quarter, with revenue growth of 8% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.94 per share, up 11% year-over-year. The company's growth strategy, which includes selective investments in key products, geographic expansion, and new product launches, appears to be paying off. However, the company's guidance for 2011 non-GAAP EPS was narrowed to $3.72 to $3.76 due to the relinquishment of REMICADE and SIMPONI in certain territories this quarter. The company's focus on innovation and life cycle management, as well as its cost-saving measures, suggests a positive outlook for the company's future growth.
