Based on the earnings transcript, Merck & Co., Inc. reported solid earnings in the third quarter of 2014. The company's stock price is likely to experience a positive impact due to the following factors:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Merck reported a 4% decrease in total company revenues, but this was driven by divestitures and a change in currency rates. The company's core product areas, such as diabetes and acute care, showed growth, indicating a strong underlying performance.
2. **Successful Product Launches**: Merck launched KEYTRUDA, a first-in-class orexin receptor antagonist for insomnia, and received approval for KEYTRUDA in Japan. These launches are expected to drive growth in the coming quarters.
3. **Cost-Saving Measures**: Merck is on track to achieve its target of a $2.5 billion reduction in expenses by the end of 2015, which will improve the company's operating leverage and profitability.
4. **Positive Outlook**: The company provided an optimistic outlook for the rest of the year, with expected revenue growth driven by key product launches and cost-saving measures.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive. The company's strong financial performance, successful product launches, and positive outlook suggest that investors should expect a rally in the stock price in the next 1-2 weeks.
