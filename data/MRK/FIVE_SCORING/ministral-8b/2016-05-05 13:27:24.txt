**Analysis:**

Merck's Q1 2016 earnings call highlighted strong performance across key product lines, including KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and JANUVIA. The company reported a 3% growth in revenue excluding foreign exchange, driven by robust sales in the U.S. and international markets. However, the company faced challenges due to generic competition and regulatory hurdles, particularly in the EU for ZEPATIER. The delay in the EU launch of ZEPATIER and the early entry of generic NASONEX in the U.S. contributed to a negative impact on the company's sales guidance for the full year.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term implications for Merck's stock price are likely to be mixed. The strong Q1 performance and growth in key product lines should provide a positive boost to the stock price. However, the challenges posed by generic competition and regulatory hurdles, particularly in the EU, could lead to a temporary setback. Overall, the stock price is expected to remain volatile in the short term, with a potential for both positive and negative movements. The rating for the short-term impact on the stock price is:
