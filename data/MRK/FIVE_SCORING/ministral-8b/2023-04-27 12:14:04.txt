**Analysis:**

Merck's Q1 earnings call demonstrated strong performance across key growth drivers, particularly in oncology and vaccines, with robust underlying growth despite the expected decline in LAGEVRIO sales. The company's acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences is expected to accelerate growth in immunology and provide a significant revenue growth driver. Management's optimism about the company's pipeline and strategic growth is evident, with a focus on science-led innovation and strategic business development. The guidance for 2023 is also optimistic, with projected revenue growth of 8% to 10% and EPS of $6.88 to $7.00. However, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the impact of the proposed acquisition of Prometheus, which is expected to result in a one-time charge that will increase research and development expenses by approximately $10.3 billion or approximately $4 per share.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the expected one-time charge from the acquisition of Prometheus and the potential for reduced growth in LAGEVRIO sales. However, the long-term outlook remains positive, with strong growth prospects in immunology and other therapeutic areas.

**Rating:**
