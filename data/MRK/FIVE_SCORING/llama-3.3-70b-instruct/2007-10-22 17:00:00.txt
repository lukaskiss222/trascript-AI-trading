Merck's strong Q3 performance, driven by robust sales of new products like GARDASIL and JANUVIA, suggests a positive short-term impact on the stock. The company's increased EPS guidance and expected long-term double-digit earning per share growth also contribute to this outlook. However, potential risks such as VIOXX litigation and competition in certain markets could impact the stock's performance.
