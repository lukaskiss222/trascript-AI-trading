Merck's Q3 2006 earnings call revealed a strong performance, driven by the success of Singulair, Vytorin, and Zetia, as well as the company's vaccines business. The company raised its full-year 2006 guidance, citing a solid quarter and strong year-to-date performance. However, the stock may face short-term pressure due to the Vioxx litigation uncertainty and the ongoing impact of patent expiries, such as Zocor. Overall, the company's fundamentals and long-term strategy appear intact, but near-term headwinds may limit stock upside.
