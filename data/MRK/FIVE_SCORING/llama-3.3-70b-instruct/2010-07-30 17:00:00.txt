Merck's Q2 earnings call revealed a solid performance, with the company achieving strong bottom-line results despite challenges from patent expiries and a difficult economy. Key brands such as JANUVIA, REMICADE, and ISENTRESS drove growth, while the company's emerging markets business expanded by 12%. However, the loss of exclusivity for COZAAR and HYZAAR, as well as European austerity measures, are expected to impact revenue in the second half of 2010. Management expressed confidence in achieving long-term financial targets, including a high single-digit non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013.
