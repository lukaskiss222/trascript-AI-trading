Merck's Q4 and full-year earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, driven by new product launches, including GARDASIL, JANUVIA, and ISENTRESS. The company's non-GAAP EPS grew 27% year-over-year, and management reaffirmed its 2008 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.28 to $3.38. However, the recent ENHANCE trial controversy surrounding VYTORIN and ZETIA may pose a short-term headwind, despite management's confidence in the products' safety and efficacy profiles. Overall, Merck's fundamentals remain strong, with a diverse product portfolio and a robust pipeline, which should support long-term growth.
