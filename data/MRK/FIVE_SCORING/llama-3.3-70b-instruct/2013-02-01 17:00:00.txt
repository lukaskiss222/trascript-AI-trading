Merck's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with the company maintaining its top line revenue despite patent expirations and macro challenges, but facing downward pressure on gross margins due to a mix shift. The decision to include data from the extension study in the filing for odanacatib regulatory approvals may indicate potential safety concerns, but management remains committed to the drug's potential. The company's pipeline is advancing, with multiple filings expected in 2013, and the animal health business is a strong contributor to overall performance.
