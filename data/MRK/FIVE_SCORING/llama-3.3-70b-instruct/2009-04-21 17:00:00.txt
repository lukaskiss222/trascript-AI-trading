Merck's Q1 results were impacted by the challenging economy, with revenue declining 8% year-over-year. However, the company remains on track to meet its full-year earnings guidance, driven by strong growth from its newest medicines, JANUVIA, JANUMET, and ISENTRESS. The planned merger with Schering-Plough is expected to be accretive in the first full year after the deal closes, with significant synergies anticipated thereafter. Management's tone was cautiously optimistic, with a focus on delivering sustainable growth and navigating the current economic uncertainties.
