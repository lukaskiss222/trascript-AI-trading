Merck's Q1 earnings exceeded expectations, driven by strong sales of SINGULAIR, GARDASIL, and JANUVIA, as well as favorable currency exchange rates. The company raised its full-year EPS guidance, citing confidence in its pipeline and cost-control efforts. Management's tone was positive, highlighting the successful uptake of new products and progress in vaccine yields. However, potential headwinds include the loss of exclusivity for ZOCOR and FOSAMAX, and uncertainty around the ARCOXIA approval.
