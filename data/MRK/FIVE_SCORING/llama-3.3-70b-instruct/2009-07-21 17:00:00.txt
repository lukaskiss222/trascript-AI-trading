Merck's Q2 earnings call revealed a solid operational performance, with strong growth from key pharmaceutical brands and international markets, offset by foreign exchange headwinds and higher R&D investments. The company reaffirmed its 2009 guidance, and management expressed confidence in the proposed merger with Schering-Plough, expected to close in Q4. While there are short-term challenges, such as the impact of healthcare reform and slowing sales of certain products, Merck's diversified portfolio and pipeline investments position it for long-term growth. The stock is likely to experience short-term volatility due to market uncertainty and merger-related risks, but overall, the company's fundamentals remain intact.
