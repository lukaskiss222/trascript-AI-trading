Merck's Q2 2007 earnings call revealed strong top-line growth, driven by key products such as SINGULAIR, VYTORIN, and ZETIA, as well as robust sales of vaccines like GARDASIL. The company raised its full-year EPS guidance, citing strong performance and increasing confidence in its ability to achieve long-term growth targets. Management's tone was optimistic, highlighting the success of new product launches and the potential for future growth opportunities. While there are some concerns around the VIOXX litigation and potential impacts on gross margins due to the growing vaccine business, overall, the call suggests a positive short-term outlook for Merck's stock.
