Merck's Q3 earnings call revealed a solid performance despite the loss of SINGULAIR exclusivity in the US. The company's key products, such as JANUVIA and GARDASIL, drove growth, and emerging markets sales increased by 15% excluding exchange. However, the patent expiration of SINGULAIR and foreign exchange headwinds affected revenue. Management guided for a non-GAAP EPS range of $3.78 to $3.82 for 2012. Considering the mixed signals, the stock may experience short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key contracts.
