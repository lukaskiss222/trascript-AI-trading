Merck's earnings call revealed mixed signals, with solid Q3 results but lowered 2008 and 2010 guidance due to delays in vaccine manufacturing, supply shortfalls, and challenges in driving demand for certain products. Despite these headwinds, the company's growth drivers, such as Januvia and Janumet, continue to perform well, and management remains committed to its long-term strategy. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key products, but the company's strong balance sheet, cost-cutting measures, and investments in emerging markets and new products may support its long-term outlook.
