Merck's Q4 earnings call revealed a strong performance driven by its newer products, including Gardasil and Januvia, which offset the loss of exclusivity for Zocor. The company reaffirmed its 2007 guidance, expecting EPS of $2.51 to $2.59, excluding restructuring charges. Management's tone was positive, highlighting the company's progress in its restructuring efforts and its commitment to delivering long-term double-digit compound annual earnings growth. The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings report and reaffirmed guidance.
