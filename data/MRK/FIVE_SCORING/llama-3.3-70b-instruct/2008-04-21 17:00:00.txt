Merck's Q1 earnings call showed a mix of positive and negative factors affecting the company's performance. The company reported solid earnings, with non-GAAP EPS of $0.89, and affirmed its 2008 guidance despite challenges from the Merck/Schering-Plough joint venture and the loss of patent protection for FOSAMAX. However, the decline in sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA due to the ENHANCE trial results and subsequent market confusion poses a significant risk to the company's near-term performance. Management's efforts to address these issues and reaffirm the value of these products are underway, but the situation remains uncertain.
