Merck's Q2 2009 earnings call suggests limited short-term excitement for stock performance. While the company reported a solid operational performance, growth in key products, and reaffirmed guidance, concerns include a decline in Gardasil sales, foreign exchange rate impacts, and potential risks from the proposed merger. Also, the challenges with vaccine supply and flat growth for some products might limit immediate positive reactions from the stock market. Ongoing health care reform uncertainties add another layer of caution for investors, leading to a neutral short-term outlook with a slight negative bias.
