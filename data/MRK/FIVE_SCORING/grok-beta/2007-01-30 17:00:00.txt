Merck & Co. reported a strong start in its efforts to regain leadership in the pharmaceutical industry, with full-year earnings per share of $2.52. However, the company faced several headwinds such as legal defense costs for VIOXX and Fosamax, and a significant acquired research charge related to the Sirna Therapeutics purchase, which might create short-term uncertainty around valuation. Additionally, while newer products like Gardasil and Januvia showed promising sales growth, the costs associated with their promotion and the legal battles could overshadow the positive impact in the short term.
