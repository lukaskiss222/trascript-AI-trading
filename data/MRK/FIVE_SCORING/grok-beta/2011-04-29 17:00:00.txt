Merck & Co., Inc.'s Q1 2011 earnings call highlights several growth drivers like JANUVIA, VICTRELIS, and expansion in emerging markets, yet the reported EPS of \$0.92, while strong, falls short of the annualized run-rate compared to the midpoint of annual guidance, indicating potential conservative guidance due to factors like the J&J arbitration impact in the second half. While R&D costs have been reduced, the focus remains on investing in high-growth areas and market launches, which should support stock price stability. However, uncertainties around the full year performance could introduce some negative short-term pressure, leading to a slightly cautious outlook.
