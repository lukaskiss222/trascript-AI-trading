Merck's second-quarter earnings indicate a business that is successfully navigating the impending loss of exclusivity for a key product, SINGULAIR, while demonstrating growth, cost management, and pipeline progress.

However, the currency headwinds and expected margin pressure from the U.S. SINGULAIR patent expiration could temper stock price performance in the short term.
