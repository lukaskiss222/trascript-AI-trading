Merck & Co.'s Q1 2009 earnings call highlights several areas of concern for short-term stock performance. The company missed performance expectations across its portfolio, especially for GARDASIL, due to economic pressures affecting vaccine sales, and lower uptake in specific age groups. This, combined with lower-than-expected product gross margins, wholesale inventory reductions, and foreign exchange impacts, led to a revision of full-year revenue guidance downward by $500 million. While the company reaffirmed its non-GAAP EPS guidance and showed optimism about future product performances, the impact of these factors suggests that the stock might experience some negative pressure in the near term as investors digest these results and the execution risks associated with Merck's transformative initiatives, including the pending Schering-Plough merger.
