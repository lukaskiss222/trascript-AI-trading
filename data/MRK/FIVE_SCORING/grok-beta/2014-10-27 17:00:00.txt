Merck's Q3 earnings report should support stock price stabilization in the short-term due to several factors:

- Reported solid earnings with progress in key therapeutic areas like diabetes and oncology, which signals growth potential. 
- The launch of KEYTRUDA and cost-saving measures are positive developments. However, uncertainties around TECOS results and challenging external market conditions could temper immediate stock movement.
