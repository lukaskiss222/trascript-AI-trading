Merck's third quarter results for 2006 show resilience with strong growth from Vytorin/Zetia, vaccines like Gardasil, and new product launches like Januvia, which could sustain positive investor sentiment. However, a significant Vioxx legal reserve charge signals ongoing risk and cost to shareholders. While EPS guidance was raised, the legal overhang might limit short-term stock appreciation, suggesting a more neutral stance for the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
