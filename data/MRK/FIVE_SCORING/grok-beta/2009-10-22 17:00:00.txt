Merck's Q3 earnings call revealed a solid performance with a 2% revenue growth, driven mainly by strong sales of key brands like SINGULAIR, JANUVIA, JANUMET, and ISENTRESS. The company also issued positive updates regarding the pending merger with Schering-Plough, which is expected to close in Q4, potentially fostering investor confidence. However, the mixed guidance for Q4 and lower expectations for the cholesterol joint venture could temper short-term stock price reactions. Management's focus on integrating and leveraging both companies' R&D efforts signals future growth, but near-term focus might be on managing expenses due to the seasonality of products. The stock is likely to see a positive short-term impact due to the strong performance and merger optimism, though tempered by expectations and integration costs.
