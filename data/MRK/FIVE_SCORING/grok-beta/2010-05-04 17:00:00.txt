Merck's first quarter results post-merger reflect a positive revenue trend with a 7% growth in the combined business, strong performances from key brands, and progress in integration efforts. However, the stock may experience short-term pressure due to concerns such as the healthcare reform's cost implications, lower equity income, delays in inventory buildup reversal, and the ongoing integration which might lead to operational uncertainties. The anticipation of future quarters will likely have some balancing of these impacts with continued cost synergies and product launches potentially offering growth, but near-term guidance adjustments and questions on longer-term revenue might cause investor caution.
