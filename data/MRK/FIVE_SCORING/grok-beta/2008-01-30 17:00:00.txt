Merckâ€™s Q4 2007 earnings demonstrated strong financial performance, with revenue and EPS growth aligning with market expectations. However, concerns surrounding the cardiovascular drug franchise and potential impacts from marketing exclusivities (e.g. FOSAMAX) and the ongoing VIOXX litigation could exert downward pressure on the stock in the short term. The aggressive response to address ENHANCE trial concerns and positive comments from the FDA might eventually stabilize investor confidence, but the immediate reaction may be cautious.
