Merck's Q2 performance reflects a decline in key brands like GARDASIL and SINGULAIR, with significant challenges in market penetration for GARDASIL's adult cohort, coupled with ongoing FDA reviews and supply constraints for vaccines. However, there's positive momentum from newer products like JANUVIA, JANUMET, and ISENTRESS, alongside efforts to reduce costs. The uncertainty around the SEAS study's impact on VYTORIN and ZETIA adds to the short-term volatility. Management's proactive measures to address these issues suggest potential stabilization and growth in the medium term, but the immediate future (1-2 weeks) likely sees a cautious market response due to lowered guidance and regulatory uncertainties.
