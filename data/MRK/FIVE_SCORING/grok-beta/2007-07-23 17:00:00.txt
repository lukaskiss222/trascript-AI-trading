Merck's Q2 2007 earnings call indicates a robust performance with significant sales growth in key franchises like SINGULAIR and GARDASIL, alongside strong early uptake of newer products. The company raised its full-year EPS guidance and demonstrated strategic progress in managing its patent lifecycle challenges. However, looming VIOXX litigation costs, increased R&D expenses, and marketing investment for ongoing product launches could exert slight pressure on margins in the near term. Overall, the positive momentum should outweigh negatives, suggesting a positive impact on the stock price in the immediate 1â€“2 weeks.
