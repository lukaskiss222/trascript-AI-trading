Merck's Q1 2012 earnings call highlighted strong performance across its key growth drivers and ongoing strategic initiatives. The company managed to deliver sales growth in its core businesses, alongside tight expense management, which resulted in a significant EPS increase. Management's confidence in navigating patent expiries, like that of SINGULAIR, and their optimism for continued growth, supported by a robust late-stage pipeline and strategic expansions in emerging markets, reflect well on future outlook. However, the stock might face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance for the year and uncertainties in the global health care environment.
