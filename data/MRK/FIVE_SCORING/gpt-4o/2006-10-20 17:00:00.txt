Merckâ€™s earnings call for Q3 2006 portrays a positive short-term outlook with notable achievements such as increased vaccine sales, especially for newly launched products like Gardasil and Rotateq. Restoration of EPS guidance upwards, despite the legal overhang from Vioxx litigation, signals confidence from management in ongoing operations and product pipeline, including the recent approval of Januvia. Despite some financial impacts from the loss of patent exclusivity on key drugs, the company's continued growth in other sectors and positive market responses to new products suggest a likely positive short-term impact on the stock.
