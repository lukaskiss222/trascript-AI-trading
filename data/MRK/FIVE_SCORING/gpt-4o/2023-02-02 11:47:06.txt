Merck's recent earnings call highlights strong performance in 2022, particularly with its Oncology, Vaccines, and Cardiovascular segments. The positive updates on pipeline advancements, including regulatory approvals for KEYTRUDA and promising clinical trial results, bolster the company's robust growth narrative. Despite potential challenges from patent expirations post-2028, Merck's strategic focuses, such as the subcutaneous formulation for KEYTRUDA and its partnership with Moderna on a personalized cancer vaccine, demonstrate strong future growth prospects. This solid performance, alongside optimistic 2023 guidance, should positively impact the stock in the short term.
