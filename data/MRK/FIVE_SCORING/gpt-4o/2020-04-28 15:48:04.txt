Merck's earnings call highlights a strong Q1 performance with increased revenues and demand across their key divisions such as oncology and vaccines. However, the company anticipates short-term challenges from COVID-19, predicting the most significant impact in Q2 due to reduced patient access for physician-administered products. While they have lowered their full-year guidance due to these expected disruptions and unfavorable currency exchange, Merck maintains confidence in a return to strong growth as conditions normalize. The cautious outlook combined with Merck's solid fundamentals suggests a moderate negative short-term impact on the stock.
