Merck & Co.'s Q3 2012 earnings call displayed resilience amidst significant headwinds, notably the SINGULAIR patent expiration. The company managed to maintain revenue at levels comparable to 2011, backed by solid growth in key products like JANUVIA and GARDASIL, and an impressive 7% growth in animal health excluding exchange impacts. Positive developments in their drug pipeline, strategic market expansions, and disciplined cost management underpin a favorable outlook, suggesting slight positive sentiment and support for the stock in the short term.
