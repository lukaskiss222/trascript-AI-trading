Merck's earnings call presented a mixed outlook. Positively, the company reported promising starts in 2016 with strong sales from KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and JANUVIA, and expressed confidence in expanding their oncology leadership. However, several headwinds were noted, including generic competition for NASONEX, uncertainties in the hepatitis C market, and manufacturing issues in the EU affecting ZEPATIER's launch timeline. The stock might experience minor volatility due to these challenges but the overall strategic focus on innovative drug development should provide some support to the price.
