Merck's Q1 2008 call suggests mixed short-term implications for the stock. The company posted solid earnings and reaffirmed its yearly guidance despite facing challenges, particularly with the cholesterol joint venture and its products VYTORIN and ZETIA, which are under market pressure due to the ENHANCE trial results. However, strong performances from other pharmaceuticals and vaccines like GARDASIL offer some stability. Given the lowered expectations for the cholesterol JV and ongoing market uncertainties, there might be some near-term pressure on the stock despite reaffirming guidance.
