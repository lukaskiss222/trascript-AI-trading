Merck’s Q4 earnings call presented a cautiously optimistic outlook. The company exceeded EPS expectations for 2015, despite foreign currency headwinds, and management guided for continued growth in new product sales, particularly from KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER. However, the market's focus will likely be on the pricing strategy for ZEPATIER in the competitive HCV market and its ability to penetrate despite existing long-term contracts. There's also potential for regulatory shifts affecting pricing strategies, highlighted by management’s continual focus on disciplined cost management and strategic M&A. Overall, the tone was confident but did not convey any immediate catalysts for a significant upside move, suggesting a stable outlook with potential moderate positive impact as new product sales begin to ramp up.
