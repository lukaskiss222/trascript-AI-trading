Merck & Co., Inc.'s Q2 2008 earnings call highlighted several concerns that could impact its stock price in the short term. Key challenges include revenue pressures from slower-than-expected sales of HPV vaccine GARDASIL, uncertainty over cholesterol drugs VYTORIN and ZETIA following the SEAS study, and safety investigations into SINGULAIR. While the company is addressing these issues with cost management and a robust pipeline, the immediate lack of 2008 guidance and unclear impact from the SEAS results point to short-term uncertainty and potential downward pressure on the stock.
