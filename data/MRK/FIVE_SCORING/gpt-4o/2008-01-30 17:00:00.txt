Merck & Co. reported solid fourth-quarter and full-year 2007 results with revenue growth driven by strong sales of vaccines like GARDASIL and recently launched products such as JANUVIA and ISENTRESS. Despite challenges from major patent expirations, the company maintained positive momentum and is on track for continued growth. However, the company's involvement with the ENHANCE trial remains a source of uncertainty, potentially impacting VYTORIN and ZETIA sales, although the impact appears to be more pronounced in the U.S. market. Management's confidence in its product pipeline, strategic investments, international rollout of GARDASIL, and strong financial guidance suggest potential resilience against these headwinds.
