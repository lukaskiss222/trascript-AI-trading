Merck's Q1 2018 earnings call highlights a strong performance, particularly with the success of KEYTRUDA in various cancer treatments which is significantly contributing to revenue growth. The positive implications of the KEYNOTE-189 results and the robust pipeline, along with the company's decision to raise revenue and EPS guidance, suggest a favorable short-term outlook. Furthermore, the positive momentum in both U.S. and international markets for KEYTRUDA and the continued growth in the Animal Health segment are expected to bolster the stock performance over the next 1-2 weeks.
