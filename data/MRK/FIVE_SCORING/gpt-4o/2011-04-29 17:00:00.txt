Merck's first quarter 2011 results indicate a strong start to the year, with double-digit EPS growth and robust performance across key product lines like JANUVIA and SINGULAIR. The company is effectively managing the loss of exclusivity challenges while maintaining strong revenue streams from diverse geographical markets, particularly emerging markets and Japan. The positive regulatory updates, such as the anticipated approval of VICTRELIS for hepatitis C, further contribute to bolstering near-term outlook. The clear guidance and elevated confidence in share repurchase plans reflect a solid operational footing, suggesting a positive short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock.
