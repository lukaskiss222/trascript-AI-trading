Merck demonstrated a strong performance in the first quarter of 2007, exceeding their own earnings expectations and raising full-year EPS guidance. Key drivers include robust sales across product lines, particularly from SINGULAIR, ZETIA, VYTORIN, GARDASIL, and JANUVIA. Management showed confidence in continued growth and articulated ongoing commitments to cost control and new product developments. Despite some litigation risks, the positive financial results and increased guidance likely bode well for short-term stock performance.
