Merck's earnings call detailed a strong Q3 performance, driven by increased revenues from KEYTRUDA and new product launches. The company offers solid guidance for 2024, indicating continued growth prospects, particularly in oncology and vaccines. However, challenges remain with GARDASIL, especially in China, where sales are expected to decline due to inventory levels and market uncertainties. The management's confidence in other growth drivers, like WINREVAIR and CAPVAXIVE, alongside robust pipeline advancements, suggests positive momentum. Still, given the headwinds in the Chinese market, the short-term stock impact may remain neutral to slightly positive.
