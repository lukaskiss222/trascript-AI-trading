Merck's Q1 2013 earnings call reveals a challenging quarter with a notable decline in worldwide sales due to patent expirations and increased pricing pressures, particularly on JANUVIA. Despite achieving EPS targets through cost reductions and a robust share repurchase initiative, the company adjusted its 2013 guidance downwards, highlighting new R&D investments and foreign exchange headwinds as additional pressures. While there are opportunities in emerging markets and new product potentials like the PD-1 program, the immediate patent and competitive pressures suggest short-term vulnerabilities for the stock.
