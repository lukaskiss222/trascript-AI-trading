Merck's Q3 2008 earnings call highlighted several challenges impacting the company's short-term outlook. The lowered 2008 and 2010 guidance due to manufacturing delays in vaccines and challenges with key products like Gardasil, Singulair, and the cholesterol JV signals potential short-term stock pressure. Despite restructuring efforts and positive performance in certain newly launched drugs, the stock may face negative sentiment due to the reduced revenue guidance and ongoing operational issues that were emphasized in management's remarks.
