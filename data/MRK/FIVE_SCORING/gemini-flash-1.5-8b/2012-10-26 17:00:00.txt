Merck's earnings call highlights a strong performance despite the SINGULAIR patent expiration, driven by growth in key products and emerging markets.  Management expressed confidence in their 4-part strategy, emphasizing continued focus on core brands, geographic expansion, and cost management.  The near-term outlook anticipates maintaining sales at or near 2011 levels, but the longer term focus is on new pipeline products and future growth, suggesting a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock in the next 1-2 weeks.
