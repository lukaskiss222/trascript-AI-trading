Merck's Q2 2013 earnings call highlighted continued challenges from patent expirations, but also showed resilience in key areas.  While sales declined overall, strong performance in some brands like Januvia and positive emerging market growth provide a counterpoint.  Management maintained EPS guidance but adjusted revenue expectations downward, primarily due to unfavorable currency exchange rates.  The call suggests Merck is focused on managing costs and maximizing returns on key R&D initiatives.
