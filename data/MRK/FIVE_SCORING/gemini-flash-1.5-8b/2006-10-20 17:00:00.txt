Merck's Q3 2006 earnings call highlighted strong performance, particularly in vaccines and the Zetia/Vytorin combination.  The company raised full-year guidance, indicating continued success despite patent expirations, and emphasized future growth strategies through research and alliances.  The substantial Vioxx litigation reserve and resulting impact on reported earnings are a noteworthy concern, potentially weighing on the short-term sentiment.
