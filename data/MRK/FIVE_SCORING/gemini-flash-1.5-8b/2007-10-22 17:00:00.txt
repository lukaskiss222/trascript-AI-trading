Merck's earnings call highlights strong growth in new product revenue, particularly GARDASIL and JANUVIA.  Management emphasized the positive impact of these launches and the continued momentum of existing franchises.  While guidance is raised, the call also acknowledges ongoing restructuring costs, litigation expenses, and potential challenges in maintaining strong sales as other products lose patent protection or face generic competition.
