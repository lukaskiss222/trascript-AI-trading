Merck's earnings call highlights strong performance, particularly KEYTRUDA's continued success and exceeding $3 billion in quarterly sales.  Management is optimistic about the future, raising guidance for 2019 and emphasizing continued investment in R&D and business development.  The call also notes some pressure points, including pricing and potential competitive threats, as well as a tempered growth outlook for GARDASIL in 2020.  The strong results and management's outlook should likely support a positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
