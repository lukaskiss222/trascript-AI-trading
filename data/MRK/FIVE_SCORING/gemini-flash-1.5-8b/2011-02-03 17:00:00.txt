Merck's earnings call highlighted strong Q4 performance and continued growth momentum despite a challenging macro environment.  Management emphasized reinvesting synergies into growth areas like new product launches (boceprevir, DULERA, etc.) and emerging markets, and expressed a commitment to sustainable, long-term growth rather than focusing on short-term EPS targets.  This shift in strategy, combined with cost-cutting measures, points to potential stock price volatility in the near term, with the market possibly initially reacting negatively to the withdrawal of the 2013 EPS guidance, but positively, in the long-term, to the focus on sustainable growth.
