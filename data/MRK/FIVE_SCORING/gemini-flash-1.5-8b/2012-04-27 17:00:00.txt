Merck's Q1 2012 earnings call showcased strong performance across multiple business segments, particularly in Animal Health and Consumer Care.  Management highlighted a solid start to the year, despite challenges like patent expiration for Singulair and a challenging global economic climate.  Growth projections remain consistent with the previous guidance, suggesting a potential short-term neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price, with the strongest potential for positive movement in the second quarter.
