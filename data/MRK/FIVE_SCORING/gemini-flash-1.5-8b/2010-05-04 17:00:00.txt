Merck's Q1 2010 earnings call highlights strong top-line growth driven by key brands like JANUVIA, REMICADE, and SINGULAIR.  Management expresses confidence in the merger's integration and future prospects, though some revenue concerns are raised about COZAAR/HYZAAR losing exclusivity, and the trajectory of US sales of JANUVIA and JANUMET.  The company's guidance for 2010 points to continued growth, but the underlying uncertainties regarding revenue and expense management suggest some short-term volatility.
