Merck's Q1 2015 earnings call highlights significant progress in their immuno-oncology pipeline, particularly with KEYTRUDA's strong performance and clinical trial results.  Positive data from KEYTRUDA in several indications, including lung cancer, and the receipt of FDA filings for lung cancer and the presentation of TECOS study data suggests strong potential for future growth and market leadership. This, coupled with growth in other core areas like diabetes, hospital acute care, and vaccines, should drive positive investor sentiment.
