Merck's Q3 2021 earnings call highlighted strong performance, driven by robust KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL sales, and significant progress with Molnupiravir.  Positive clinical trial results for Molnupiravir—showing a 50% reduction in hospitalization/death risk—and the anticipated FDA EUA are likely to generate significant investor interest.  The acquisition of Acceleron and the company's continued focus on business development and pipeline expansion present a positive outlook for the short-term and long-term growth.
