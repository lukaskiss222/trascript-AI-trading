Merck's Q3 2017 earnings call highlighted strong performance in KEYTRUDA and Animal Health, offsetting some patent loss and pricing pressures.  Management emphasized continued investment in R&D and a balanced portfolio approach, suggesting a focus on long-term growth rather than short-term stock price volatility.  Guidance revisions indicate a positive outlook for 2018, albeit with some ongoing challenges and potential continued R&D spending increases.
