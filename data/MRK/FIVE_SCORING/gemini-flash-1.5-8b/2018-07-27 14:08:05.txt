Merck's Q2 2018 earnings call highlights strong performance, especially in oncology (KEYTRUDA, Lynparza, LENVIMA) and Animal Health.  Management projects continued revenue and EPS growth for the remainder of the year, with the positive outlook reflecting robust clinical data and regulatory approvals for KEYTRUDA,  and the ongoing successes within the Animal Health unit.   While there are some concerns about pricing pressures on some products outside the US, the overall positive tone and promising outlook suggest a likely positive short-term impact on the stock price.
