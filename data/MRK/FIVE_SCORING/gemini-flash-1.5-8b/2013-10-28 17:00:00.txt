Merck's Q3 2013 earnings call highlighted a continued focus on managing cost and navigating patent expirations.  While the company showed solid growth in some key areas (vaccines, immunology), performance in the U.S. for Januvia was weaker than expected, primarily due to inventory issues.  Management emphasized a global strategy focused on prioritizing key areas for investment and efficiency improvements.  The short-term implication is likely a cautious outlook for the stock, as strong performances in some areas are counterbalanced by ongoing challenges in others.
