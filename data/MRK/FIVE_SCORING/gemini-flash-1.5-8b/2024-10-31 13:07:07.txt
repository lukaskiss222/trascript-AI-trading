Merck's Q3 earnings show continued strong performance, particularly in KEYTRUDA and Animal Health.  Positive data from clinical trials, including clesrovimab for RSV prevention and CAPVAXIVE's expanded pneumococcal recommendation, bolster the company's future outlook.  However, GARDASIL sales in China remain a concern, but management expressed confidence in addressing the issue through increased promotional efforts and the eventual male vaccination opportunity.  Short-term, the stock is likely to benefit from the positive momentum and pipeline advancements, but potential headwinds from GARDASIL in China should be considered over the next few weeks.
