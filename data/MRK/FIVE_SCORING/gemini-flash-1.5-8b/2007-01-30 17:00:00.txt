Merck's earnings call indicates continued strong performance, particularly in new product launches like Gardasil and Januvia.  However, the substantial legal reserve increases for Vioxx and Fosamax litigation represent a significant near-term headwind.  Management's reaffirmation of 2007 guidance, coupled with ongoing strategic initiatives, suggests a commitment to long-term growth, but the uncertainty surrounding litigation outcomes likely generates short-term volatility.
