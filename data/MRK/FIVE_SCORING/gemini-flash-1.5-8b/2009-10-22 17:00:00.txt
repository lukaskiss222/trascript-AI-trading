Merck's earnings call highlighted strong Q3 performance, driven by growth in key brands like Singulair, Januvia, and Janumet.  Management expressed confidence in the upcoming merger with Schering-Plough and projected a positive outlook for the combined entity, especially in emerging markets, biologics, and vaccines.  However, the call also noted challenges with GARDASIL sales, slower enrollment in certain clinical trials and overall economic factors affecting certain patient populations which could impact short-term stock performance.
