Merck's Q2 2014 earnings call highlighted strong performance in key franchises like diabetes, immunology, and vaccines, fueled by international growth and promising new product launches like pembrolizumab and suvorexant.  Management affirmed guidance despite anticipated dilution from divestitures and acquisitions, suggesting confidence in the company's ability to offset these effects.  The anticipated regulatory approvals for key products in the coming months are likely to be a significant driver of the stock price over the next few weeks.
