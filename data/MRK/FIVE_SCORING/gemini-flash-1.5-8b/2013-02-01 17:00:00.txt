Merck's earnings call highlights continued pressure from patent expirations, particularly Singulair, but management emphasizes the strength of their core products like Januvia and Janumet, as well as growth in emerging markets.  The company is focused on maintaining revenue near prior-year levels despite the challenges, by investing in growth areas and cost reduction.  This mixed picture of short-term headwinds and long-term strategies will likely keep the stock price in a neutral to slightly negative position over the next 2 weeks.
