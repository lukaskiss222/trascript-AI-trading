Merck's Q1 2008 earnings call reveals a strategy focused on long-term growth despite short-term headwinds related to the VYTORIN/ZETIA controversy.  Management reaffirmed their financial guidance, though lowered equity income and revenue expectations due to the impact of the ENHANCE trial and market volatility affecting VYTORIN and ZETIA sales.  The company is actively restructuring and focusing on expansion into non-patented markets. This approach suggests a potential for positive long-term performance, but short-term impact on the stock price appears cautious given the specifics of lowered guidance, especially regarding the cholesterol products.
