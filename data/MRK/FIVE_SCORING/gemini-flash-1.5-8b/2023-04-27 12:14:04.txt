Merck's Q1 earnings call highlights strong performance across key growth drivers, particularly in oncology and vaccines.  The acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences and the positive results from various clinical trials, including KEYTRUDA and sotatercept, suggest potential for future growth. The company's raised guidance and focus on innovative therapies position it for sustained success.  However, the impact of the LAGEVRIO decline and headwinds for KEYTRUDA outside of the US, along with the impact of the Prometheus acquisition, must be factored into short-term stock movement.
