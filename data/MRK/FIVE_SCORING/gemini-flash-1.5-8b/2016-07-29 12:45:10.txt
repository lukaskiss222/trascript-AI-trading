Merck's Q2 2016 earnings call highlights strong performance of KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, driving significant revenue growth.  Management's projections for sustained growth are buoyed by continued success in KEYTRUDA's various indications, and ZEPATIER's encouraging early market reception.  However, concerns over the long-term price sustainability of immuno-oncology products and headwinds due to patent expirations of some older products suggest cautious optimism for the next few weeks.
