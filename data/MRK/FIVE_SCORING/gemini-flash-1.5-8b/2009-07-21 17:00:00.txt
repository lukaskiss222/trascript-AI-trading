Merck's earnings call highlights continued strong performance in key products like Singulair, Januvia, and Isentress, despite a challenging global economic environment.  Management reaffirmed 2009 guidance and emphasized investment in the pipeline, including the collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals.  The focus on the proposed Schering-Plough merger, along with the steps to close the deal, is a dominant theme, potentially overshadowing shorter-term stock movement in the near term.
