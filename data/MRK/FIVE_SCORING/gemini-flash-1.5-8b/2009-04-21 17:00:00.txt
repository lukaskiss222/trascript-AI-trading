Merck's Q1 2009 earnings call showed a mixed bag.  While the company maintained guidance for some key products (JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS), overall revenue guidance was lowered due to factors including the difficult economy, wholesaler inventory reductions, and the impact of patent expirations.  The delay of the telcagepant filing and the continuing challenges for GARDASIL and other products suggest short-term pressure on the stock.
