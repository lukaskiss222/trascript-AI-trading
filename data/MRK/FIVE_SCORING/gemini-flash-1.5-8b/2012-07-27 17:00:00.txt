Merck's Q2 2012 earnings call highlighted strong operational performance, with double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth and revenue growth despite challenging external factors.  Management expressed confidence in maintaining 2011 revenue levels on a constant currency basis, but also acknowledged the potential negative impact of weakening exchange rates, particularly the euro, on the second half of the year.  The planned loss of exclusivity for SINGULAIR in the US next week and generic competition were acknowledged by management.
