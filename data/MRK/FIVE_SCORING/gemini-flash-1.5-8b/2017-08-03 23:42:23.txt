Acceleron's earnings call highlighted significant progress in clinical trials, particularly for luspatercept, exceeding enrollment targets for MEDALIST and BELIEVE.  Positive data from Phase 2 studies and the anticipated mid-2018 top-line results for Phase 3 trials suggest potential for strong future performance.  However, the company's cash position has decreased slightly, but is still sufficient to fund operations.  These factors suggest a positive short-term outlook for Acceleron stock.
