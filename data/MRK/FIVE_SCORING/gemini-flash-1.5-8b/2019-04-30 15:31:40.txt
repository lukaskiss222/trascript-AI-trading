Merck's Q1 2019 earnings call indicates strong performance, driven by KEYTRUDA's continued success, GARDASIL's robust growth, and positive momentum in international markets, especially China.  Management's optimistic outlook and guidance increases, along with continued pipeline advancements, are likely to support the stock price in the short-term. External factors such as policy changes in China are noted, but the companyâ€™s strategic focus on innovative products suggests a potential buffer against challenges.
