Merck's earnings call highlighted strong performance, particularly in vaccines (GARDASIL and ROTATEQ) and other new product launches (JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS).  Management is reaffirming guidance, including a broadened 2008 GAAP EPS range.  While the ENHANCE trial continues to cause discussion, management is focused on highlighting the long-term potential and efficacy of their existing products. This suggests a potentially positive short-term trajectory for the stock, with potential for investor optimism.
