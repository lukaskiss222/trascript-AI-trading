Merck's Q3 2020 earnings call highlighted strong oncology performance, with KEYTRUDA exceeding expectations.  Management's tone was positive, emphasizing the resilience of the business and the company's continued investment in research and development of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines.  However, challenges remain in the vaccines portfolio, particularly Gardasil, due to pandemic-related disruptions.  The stock is likely to see positive short-term movement given the encouraging news on KEYTRUDA, strong pipeline, and positive outlook, but with caution warranted regarding the vaccine market.
