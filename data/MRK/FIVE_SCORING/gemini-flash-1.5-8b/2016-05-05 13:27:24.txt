Merck's Q1 2016 earnings call highlights continued success with KEYTRUDA and JANUVIA, along with the launch of ZEPATIER.  Management's tone is positive, and guidance was raised, albeit with some headwinds factored in, such as earlier-than-expected generic competition for NASONEX. The short-term impact is potentially positive, though the market's continued focus on combination therapies may affect the perceived valuation of Merck's monotherapy strategy.
