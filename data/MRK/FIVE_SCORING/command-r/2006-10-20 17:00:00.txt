Merck's Q3 earnings exceeded expectations, driven by strong performances of Singulair and vaccines like Gardasil, along with cost management strategies. The solid results are also attributed to the company's efficient launching of new products like Januvia and Zolinza. However, the increased legal provisions for Vioxx lawsuits and the non-recurrence of past rebates impact the bottom line. Merck's near-term prospects seem promising, but the stock may experience pressure due to the uncertain outcome of numerous Vioxx lawsuits. Defense spending cuts also pose risks.
