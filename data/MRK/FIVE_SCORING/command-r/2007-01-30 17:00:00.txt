Merck's Q4 earnings call reveals a mix of positive and challenging factors. Impressive topline growth and successful product launches buck the impact of expired patents and legal reserves related to the VIOXX litigation. Management's focus on cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives is commendable. However, the lack of first-quarter guidance and the potential impact of generic competition on cash cows like Singulair and Cozaar are near-term concerns. The stock will likely face pressure in the short run.
