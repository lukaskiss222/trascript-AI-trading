3M's stock will experience a neutral impact in the short term following its Q4 earnings call. The mixed signals outlined in the call — positive annual records but tempered 2008 guidance, and delays in military contracts — are likely to be interpreted by investors as a wash, resulting in a neutral stock movement. Restructuring efforts and expansions are promising for the future but will take time to materialise.
 
Merck's stock is predicted to face a negative impact in the short term post-earnings call. Uncertainties around key defense contracts and a general cautious outlook for the first half of 2010 lack the conviction to excite investors. While the upcoming merger with Schering-Plough adds intrigue, the resulting stock movement is difficult to predict and is not considered in this rating.
