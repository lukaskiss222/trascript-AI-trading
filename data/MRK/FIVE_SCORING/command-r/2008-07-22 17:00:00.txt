Merck's mixed Q2 results and lowered 2008 guidance, coupled with uncertainties around key products, spell short-term trouble. The inability to penetrate the 19â€“26 age group for GARDASIL and the challenges faced by SINGULAIR contribute to a difficult environment. The world's reliance on Merck's products and their efforts to streamline operations and focus on emerging markets for growth are encouraging. The stock will face pressure in the coming weeks.
