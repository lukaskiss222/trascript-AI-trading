Merck's earnings transcript reveals a mixed bag of results, with successes in some areas counterbalanced by challenges in others. The main negative is the lowered revenue and EPS guidance for 2010, attributed to vaccine supply issues, a weakened dolar, and slower-than-expected growth for some key products like GARDASIL and SINGULAIR. The upcoming hysteria around the Jupiter trial adds further uncertainty for the company's cholesterol drugs. However, the company's strong balance sheet, AA- credit rating, and active share repurchasing programme support the stock.Short term, the resolution of vaccine supply issues and clarity on the Jupiter trial outcomes could impact the stock positively.
