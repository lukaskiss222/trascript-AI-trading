Merck’s Q1 earnings transcript reveals a strong start to the year with decent revenue and EPS growth, beating expectations. Key positives include the robust performance of the pharmaceutical and vaccine business, consumers care, and animal health divisions. However, the pending expiry of Singulair’s patent clouds prospects slightly, along with pricing pressures and generic competition. Merz’s focus on cost management and strategic investments for future growth is promising. The stock is likely to remain stable in the short term, with potential upside on robust pipeline and launch updates.
