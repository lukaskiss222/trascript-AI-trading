Merck's fourth-quarter 2010 earnings call presents a mixed bag of signals that could influence the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Revenue and Cost Reductions**: Merck reported strong revenue performance, significant cost reductions, and double-digit earnings growth, which are positive indicators.
- **Withdrawal of 2013 EPS Guidance**: The decision to withdraw long-term EPS guidance due to the need for strategic investments in growth initiatives, despite short-term headwinds like European austerity measures and U.S. health care reform, could be seen as a negative signal by some investors.
- **Pipeline and Launches**: The company has a robust late-stage pipeline, with important filings and launches planned, such as boceprevir for hepatitis C, which could drive future growth.
- **Emerging Markets and Product Performance**: Strong growth in emerging markets and the performance of key brands like JANUVIA, JANUMET, and ISENTRESS are positive factors.
- **Macroeconomic Challenges**: The ongoing macroeconomic challenges, including European austerity measures and U.S. health care reform costs, could continue to pose headwinds.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the withdrawal of long-term guidance and the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, despite the strong underlying performance and growth prospects.
