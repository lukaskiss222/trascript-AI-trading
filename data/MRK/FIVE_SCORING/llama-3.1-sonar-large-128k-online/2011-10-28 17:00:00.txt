The transcript for Merck & Co., Inc.'s third quarter 2011 earnings call presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Operational Performance**: Merck reported an 8% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong performances from JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS, and vaccines like GARDASIL and ZOSTAVAX. This indicates robust underlying business health.

2. **Expense Management and Cost Savings**: The company has been successful in managing expenses, with a focus on efficiency and cost savings. This has contributed to an 11% increase in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter.

3. **Positive Guidance Update**: Merck raised the lower end of its 2011 non-GAAP EPS guidance range, indicating confidence in their financial performance for the year.

4. **Significant Cash Return to Shareholders**: Merck returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which is a positive signal for investor returns.

5. **Pipeline and Strategic Growth**: The company highlighted advancements in its pipeline, including the launch of VICTRELIS and agreements for new product developments. This suggests a strong focus on future growth.

However, there are also some potential short-term challenges:

1. **Competition and Pricing Pressure**: The introduction of generic versions of competitors' drugs, such as Lipitor, could exert downward pricing pressure on Merck's products like VYTORIN and ZETIA.

2. **Regulatory and Market Uncertainties**: The impact of austerity measures in Europe and health care reform in the U.S. could continue to pose challenges for the company's revenue and profitability.

Given these points, the overall sentiment from the earnings call is positive, with strong operational performance, effective expense management, and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. However, the potential for short-term headwinds from competition and regulatory uncertainties might temper some of the enthusiasm.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong operational performance, updated guidance, and significant cash return to shareholders. While there are some challenges, they do not appear to overshadow the positive aspects of the earnings report.
