Merck's fourth-quarter 2011 earnings call presented several positive and challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Merck achieved a 4% increase in full-year sales and a 10% increase in non-GAAP EPS, indicating robust operational performance and financial discipline[1|.
- **Product Growth**: Key brands like JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS, and GARDASIL showed double-digit growth, and new launches such as VICTRELIS and SIMPONI contributed significantly to revenue[1|.
- **Emerging Markets**: Strong growth in emerging markets, particularly in China and Japan, with an 18% contribution to pharmaceutical sales, suggests continued growth potential[1|.
- **Innovative Pipeline**: Merck plans to file five major products between 2012 and 2013, which could drive future growth and maintain investor confidence[1|.
- **Shareholder Value**: An 11% increase in the dividend and significant share repurchases demonstrate a commitment to returning value to shareholders[1].

### Challenging Factors
- **Patent Expiries**: The impending loss of exclusivity for SINGULAIR in the U.S. in August 2012 and the annualization of the J&J settlement could impact revenues negatively[1|.
- **Foreign Exchange**: Current exchange rates are expected to reduce sales by 2% to 3%, affecting EPS guidance[1|.
- **Pricing Pressures**: Anticipated mid-single-digit pricing pressures in Europe and biannual price reductions in Japan may also impact revenues[1|.
- **IMPROVE-IT Trial Outcome**: Uncertainty around the outcome of the IMPROVE-IT trial, which could affect VYTORIN's performance, adds some risk to the outlook[1].

Given these factors, the overall sentiment is positive but tempered by short-term challenges. The company's strong operational performance, growing key products, and promising pipeline should support the stock, despite near-term headwinds.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term, driven by the company's solid financial performance, product growth, and innovation pipeline, though tempered slightly by the upcoming patent expiries and foreign exchange pressures.
