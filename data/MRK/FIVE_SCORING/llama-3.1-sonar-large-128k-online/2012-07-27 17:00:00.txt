The earnings call for Merck & Co., Inc. for the second quarter of 2012 presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative factors that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Operational Performance**: Merck reported top-line growth and an 11% increase in non-GAAP EPS, driven by double-digit growth in key products like JANUVIA, JANUMET, and vaccines such as GARDASIL and ZOSTAVAX[3].
- **Robust Pipeline**: The company is on track with several major filings, including Odanacatib, Suvorexant, and other significant pipeline products, which could drive long-term growth[3].
- **Geographical Expansion**: Merck is seeing growth in high-growth markets like Japan and key emerging markets, which adds to the company's overall revenue[3].
- **Cost Management**: Merck has reduced operating expenses by about $200 million, indicating effective cost management[3].

### Negative Factors:
- **SINGULAIR Patent Expiration**: The loss of exclusivity for SINGULAIR in the U.S. is expected to result in rapid and significant sales erosion, which will impact the company's gross margin and revenue[3].
- **Foreign Exchange Impact**: The deterioration in foreign exchange rates, particularly the euro, is expected to adversely affect sales and bottom-line results in the second half of the year[3].
- **Pricing Pressure**: Continued pricing pressure in Europe and emerging markets could offset some of the volume growth[3].

Given these considerations, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the immediate impact of the SINGULAIR patent expiration and foreign exchange headwinds, despite the company's strong operational performance and promising pipeline.

**Rating: -1**
