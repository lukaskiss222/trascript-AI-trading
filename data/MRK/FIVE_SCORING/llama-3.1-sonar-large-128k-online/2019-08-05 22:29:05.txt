The earnings call for Acceleron Pharma highlights several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Positive Regulatory Developments**: The acceptance of the BLA and MAA filings for luspatercept by the FDA and EMA, respectively, and the granting of priority review for the beta-thalassemia indication, are significant positive milestones[5].

2. **Clinical Trial Progress**: The completion of enrollment in several Phase 2 trials, including those for ACE-083 and sotatercept, and the anticipation of top-line results in the near future, suggests potential catalysts for the stock[5].

3. **Commercial Preparation**: The company's preparation for the potential launch of luspatercept, including a dedicated sales force and joint launch planning with Celgene, indicates readiness for a major product launch[5].

4. **Financial Health**: The receipt of a $25 million milestone payment and a strong cash position of $500.9 million as of June 30, 2019, provide financial stability and the ability to fund ongoing and future clinical programs[5].

Given these factors, the overall tone of the call is positive, with multiple near-term catalysts and a solid financial foundation. This suggests that the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
