The transcript for Merck & Co., Inc.'s second-quarter 2008 earnings call reveals several key points that will likely impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Uncertainty Around SEAS Study Results**: The recent release of the SEAS study results has introduced significant uncertainty regarding the future performance of ZETIA and VYTORIN, leading Merck to delay providing updated guidance for 2008 and long-term financial performance. This uncertainty is likely to create short-term volatility in the stock price.

2. **Reduced Guidance for Key Products**: Merck has lowered its full-year guidance for SINGULAIR and GARDASIL, which are key revenue drivers. This reduction, especially for GARDASIL, due to challenges in penetrating the 19-26 year old cohort, will likely be viewed negatively by investors.

3. **Positive Notes on Other Products and Cost Management**: Despite the challenges, Merck's other products like JANUVIA, JANUMET, and ROTATEQ are showing strong growth. Additionally, the company has made significant progress in cost management, reducing marketing and administrative expenses. These positive factors might partially offset the negative impact but are unlikely to fully counterbalance the concerns around SEAS and reduced product guidance.

Given these points, the short-term impact on Merck's stock price is likely to be negative due to the uncertainty and reduced guidance for key products.
