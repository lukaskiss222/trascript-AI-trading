Merck & Co., Inc.'s second-quarter 2015 earnings call highlighted several positive and negative factors that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- Strong performance in core therapeutic areas such as diabetes, hospital acute care, vaccines, and oncology, with notable growth in the JANUVIA franchise and the successful launch of KEYTRUDA[4].
- KEYTRUDA received several regulatory approvals and milestones, including FDA priority review for its use in non-small cell lung cancer and European Commission approval for advanced melanoma[4].
- The company is advancing its pipeline with promising new products and therapies, such as ZERBAXA, BELSOMRA, and the hepatitis C treatment grazoprevir/elbasvir[4].
- Merck reported a non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, despite significant headwinds from foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestitures[1][4].

### Negative Factors:
- Total company revenues decreased by 11% year-over-year due to foreign exchange and the negative impact of acquisitions and divestitures[1][4].
- The company took a $750 million charge in the second quarter to revalue its net assets in Venezuela due to economic volatility[4].
- Sales declines in certain products like ZETIA/VYTORIN and ISENTRESS, and increased competition from biosimilars affecting Remicade sales[4].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong pipeline progress, successful launches, and solid performance in core therapeutic areas, despite some revenue headwinds and one-time charges, the stock is likely to experience a positive but muted impact in the short term.
