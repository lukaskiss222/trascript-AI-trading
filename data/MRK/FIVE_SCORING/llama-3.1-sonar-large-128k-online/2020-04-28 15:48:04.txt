The transcript of Merck & Co., Inc.'s first-quarter 2020 earnings call highlights several key points that will likely influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Reduced Guidance**: Merck lowered its full-year 2020 revenue and EPS guidance due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly affecting patient access to healthcare services and reducing sales in the second quarter. This reduction in guidance is likely to have a negative short-term impact on the stock price[1].

2. **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic is significantly affecting Merck's business, particularly in areas like vaccines, hospital specialty products, and oncology, due to reduced patient visits and elective surgeries. This impact is expected to be most severe in the second quarter, which may continue to weigh on the stock in the near term[1.).

3. **Financial Strength and Operational Continuity**: Despite the challenges, Merck's financial position remains strong, with a conservatively positioned balance sheet and continued investment in R&D and business development. This suggests that the company is well-equipped to manage the current disruptions and maintain long-term growth prospects[1].

4. **Pipeline and Research Progress**: Merck continues to make significant progress in its pipeline, including advancements in KEYTRUDA, Lynparza, and other promising therapies. This long-term potential could help stabilize investor confidence despite short-term challenges[1].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Merck's stock price is likely to be negative due to the lowered guidance and immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
