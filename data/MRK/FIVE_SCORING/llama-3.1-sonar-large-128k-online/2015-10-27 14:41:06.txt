Merck & Co., Inc.'s Q3 2015 earnings call presented several positive indicators that are likely to have a favorable impact on the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: The company reported solid top-line performance, with total revenue of $10.1 billion, and a 7% increase in non-GAAP EPS to $0.96. Despite a 5% decrease in total revenues due to foreign exchange, the company saw a 2% growth excluding these impacts and a 4% growth excluding acquisitions and divestitures[4].

2. **Key Product Performance**: JANUVIA franchise sales grew 17%, and KEYTRUDA showed significant growth, especially with its recent FDA approval for non-small cell lung cancer. The vaccine business, particularly GARDASIL 9, also saw strong performance[4].

3. **Oncology and Pipeline Progress**: Merck made substantial progress in its oncology programs, including the accelerated FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer and positive results from the KEYNOTE-010 study. The broad clinical program for KEYTRUDA across over 30 tumor types is highly promising[4].

4. **Cost Management and Efficiency**: The company achieved significant cost savings, exceeding its target of $2.5 billion in net savings versus 2012. Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than in the prior year, and the company remains committed to driving a leveraged P&L[4].

5. **Guidance and Share Buybacks**: Merck raised its full-year 2015 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $3.55-$3.60 and increased its share repurchase activity, returning approximately $4 billion to shareholders via share repurchases in 2015[4].

Given these positive factors, including strong financial performance, significant progress in key product launches, and efficient cost management, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
