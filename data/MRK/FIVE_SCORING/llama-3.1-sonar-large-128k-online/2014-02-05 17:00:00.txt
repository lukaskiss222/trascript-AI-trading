Merck’s fourth-quarter 2013 earnings call highlighted several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Financial Performance and Guidance**: Merck reported earnings consistent with guidance, despite facing headwinds from generic competition and foreign exchange. The company guided for a "trough year" in 2014 due to patent expirations, divestitures, and the conclusion of the AstraZeneca joint venture, which could lead to short-term earnings pressure[3’.

2. **Pipeline and Innovation**: The company highlighted significant advancements in its pipeline, particularly with MK3475, an anti-PD1 immunotherapy, and other promising candidates like vorapaxar and suvorexant. These developments are positive but may not immediately translate into revenue growth[3’.

3. **Cost Savings and Efficiency**: Merck emphasized its cost-saving initiatives, aiming for $2.5 billion in annual net pretax cost savings by the end of 2015. This could improve operational efficiency and free up resources for strategic investments, but the immediate impact on earnings might be mixed due to ongoing restructuring costs[3’.

4. **Strategic Reviews**: Merck is evaluating strategic options for its animal health and consumer care businesses, which could lead to significant changes but also introduces uncertainty. This process may take time and could have varying short-term impacts on the stock[3’.

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the guided earnings trough in 2014 and ongoing uncertainties around patent expirations and strategic reviews. However, the strong pipeline developments and cost-saving initiatives suggest long-term potential.
