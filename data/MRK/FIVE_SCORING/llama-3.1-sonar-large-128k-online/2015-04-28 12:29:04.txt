Merck & Co., Inc.'s first-quarter 2015 earnings call presents several positive and some neutral to negative factors that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Performance in Core Therapeutic Areas**: Merck reported growth in diabetes, hospital acute care, oncology, and vaccines, driven by products like JANUVIA, ZERBAXA, and KEYTRUDA.
- **Pipeline Progress**: Significant advancements in KEYTRUDA, including approvals and positive clinical data, as well as progress in hepatitis C and other programs, are highly encouraging.
- **Cubist Integration**: The integration of Cubist has added to Merck's revenue and strengthened its position in hospital acute care.
- **Cost Reduction and Operational Efficiency**: Merck is on track to achieve its cost reduction goals, which is expected to improve the company's operating model and profitability.

### Neutral to Negative Factors
- **Foreign Exchange Impact**: The strengthening U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales, estimated to be around $2.8 billion for the full year.
- **Divestitures and Acquisitions**: While these activities contributed to the bottom line, they also resulted in some one-time costs and revenue adjustments that may affect short-term perceptions.
- **Biosimilar Competition**: The impact of biosimilar competition on REMICADE sales, particularly in Europe, could continue to be a concern.

### Conclusion
Given the strong pipeline progress, solid performance in core therapeutic areas, and the integration of Cubist, despite some short-term headwinds from foreign exchange and biosimilar competition, Merck's stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
