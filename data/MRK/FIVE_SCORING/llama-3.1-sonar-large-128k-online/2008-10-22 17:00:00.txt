The earnings transcript for Merck & Co., Inc. reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

## Lowered Guidance
Merck has lowered its 2008 and 2010 financial guidance due to various challenges, including manufacturing issues with vaccines, supply shortfalls, and weaker-than-expected performance of some key products like SINGULAIR and the cholesterol management joint venture products (ZETIA and VYTORIN)[5].

## Manufacturing Issues
The company is facing significant manufacturing challenges, particularly with vaccines such as Zostavax, which will delay their availability and impact revenue. Despite efforts to address these issues, the short-term impact on vaccine sales is likely negative[5].

## Economic and Market Factors
The global economic conditions and foreign exchange rate fluctuations are also affecting Merck's revenue outlook, particularly since a significant portion of their sales come from outside the U.S.[5].

## Restructuring and Cost Savings
Merck has announced a new restructuring program aimed at transforming its business model, reducing costs, and increasing efficiency. While this long-term strategy is positive, the short-term costs and disruptions associated with restructuring could be a drag on the stock price[5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lowered guidance, manufacturing issues, and economic uncertainties.
