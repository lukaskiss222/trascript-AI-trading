The earnings call for Merck & Co., Inc. revealed several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

## Positive Factors
- Merck maintained its EPS guidance for 2013 despite adjusting its revenue guidance downward due to foreign exchange impacts and other factors. This shows the company's ability to manage costs and maintain profitability[5>.
- The company saw strong performance from key products like JANUVIA, SIMPONI, and GARDASIL, with 7 out of 10 top products showing growth in the second quarter[5>.
- Merck continues to invest in promising R&D programs, such as PD-1 and MK-8931, which could drive future growth and innovation[5>.
- The company executed a significant capital initiative, including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase, indicating a commitment to returning cash to shareholders[5].

## Negative Factors
- Total company sales declined 8% in the second quarter, excluding an unfavorable exchange impact of 3%, and the full-year revenue expectations were adjusted downward due to foreign exchange and other product trends[5>.
- The animal health and consumer care businesses showed weaker performance than expected, although management attributed this to specific factors and maintained confidence in their long-term potential[5>.
- The suspension of proactive recommendations for HPV vaccines in Japan could have a significant negative impact on GARDASIL sales in that market[5].

## Overall Impact
Given the mixed performance, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the revised revenue guidance and specific product challenges. However, the maintained EPS guidance, strong performance of key products, and continued investment in R&D suggest underlying strength.
