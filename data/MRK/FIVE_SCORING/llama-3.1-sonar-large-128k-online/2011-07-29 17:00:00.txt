The transcript for Merck's second-quarter 2011 earnings call highlights several positive and strategic elements that are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.

### Key Positives:
- **Strong Sales Growth**: Merck reported a 7% increase in total sales, driven by double-digit growth of key products such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, REMICADE, and ISENTRESS, along with successful new product launches like VICTRELIS[4].
- **Cost Savings and Efficiency**: The company is on track to achieve its $3.5 billion target for merger cost savings and has announced a new phase of restructuring to further reduce costs by $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion by 2015. This will help boost profit margins and ensure flexible capital allocation for growth opportunities[4].
- **Geographic Expansion**: Merck is expanding its presence in emerging markets, particularly in China, with a 30% growth in sales and strategic partnerships like the one with Simcere Pharmaceutical Group[4].
- **Pipeline and Product Approvals**: Merck received several approvals, including VICTRELIS, GARDASIL, ZOLINZA, and CUBICIN, and is progressing with its biosimilar candidates and other pipeline projects[4].

### Management's Tone and Guidance:
- **Confidence in Strategy**: Management expressed confidence in their growth strategy, emphasizing top-line growth, cost efficiencies, and strategic investments. The raised midpoint of the non-GAAP EPS target range for 2011 also indicates optimism[4].

Given these factors, the overall tone of the earnings call suggests strong performance, strategic growth initiatives, and a positive outlook, which are likely to support the stock price in the short term.
