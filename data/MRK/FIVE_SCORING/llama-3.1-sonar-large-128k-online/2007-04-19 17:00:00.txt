- **Strong Revenue and EPS Growth**: Merck reported a 7% increase in worldwide sales to $5.8 billion, exceeding expectations. The company raised its full-year EPS guidance to $2.75 to $2.85, excluding restructuring charges, which is a positive signal for investors[4>.
- **Successful New Product Launches**: Products like GARDASIL, JANUVIA, and SINGULAIR showed robust growth, with GARDASIL sales reaching $365 million and JANUVIA sales at $87 million in their first full quarter. These launches are expected to continue driving revenue growth[4].
- **Solid Performance of Joint Ventures**: The Merck-Schering-Plough partnership saw significant growth, with combined global revenue for VYTORIN and ZETIA increasing by 47% year-over-year. This partnership continues to contribute substantially to Merck's equity income[4].
- **Cost Management and Efficiency**: Despite increased spending in some areas, Merck is committed to maintaining flat marketing and administrative expenses in 2010 relative to the 2006 base, excluding certain charges. This indicates effective cost management[4].

Given these positive factors, the stock is likely to experience a short-term boost.
