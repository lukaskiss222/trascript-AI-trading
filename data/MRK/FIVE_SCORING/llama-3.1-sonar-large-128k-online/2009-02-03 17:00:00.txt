The earnings transcript for Merck & Co., Inc. presents a mixed picture that is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Guidance**: Merck reported a 1% decline in full-year 2008 revenue, and the 2009 revenue guidance is expected to be in the lower half of the $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion range. The reduction in GARDASIL guidance by $300 million is a significant factor contributing to this outlook[3].
- **Product Performance**: While products like JANUVIA, JANUMET, and ISENTRESS showed strong growth, others such as GARDASIL, SINGULAIR, and the cholesterol franchise (VYTORIN and ZETIA) faced challenges. The delay in FDA approval for GARDASIL in women aged 27-45 and the controversies surrounding VYTORIN and ZETIA are particular concerns[3].
- **Cost Management and Restructuring**: Merck has made significant progress in cost reduction and restructuring, which has helped maintain solid EPS performance despite revenue challenges. However, these efforts may not fully offset the impact of declining sales in certain key products[3].
- **Macro and Market Factors**: The economic slowdown and its impact on healthcare utilization could further pressure the company's performance in 2009[3].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly negative impact in the short term due to the tempered guidance and ongoing challenges with some key products.
