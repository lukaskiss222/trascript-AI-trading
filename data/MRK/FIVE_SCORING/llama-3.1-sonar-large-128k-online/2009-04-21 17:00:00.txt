The transcript for Merck & Co., Inc.'s first-quarter 2009 earnings call reveals several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Challenging First Quarter**: The company faced a difficult first quarter due to the loss of marketing exclusivity for some products, economic factors, and foreign exchange impacts. This led to a reduction in overall revenue guidance to $23.2 billion to $23.7 billion[5].

2. **Merger Updates**: The planned merger with Schering-Plough is progressing, with expectations of significant synergies and accretive earnings in the first full year after the deal closes. However, the integration process and associated costs could introduce some volatility[5].

3. **Product Performance**: Despite challenges, key products like JANUVIA, JANUMET, and ISENTRESS showed strong growth. However, other products such as GARDASIL and ZOSTAVAX faced significant declines due to various factors including economic pressures and supply issues[5].

4. **Financial Guidance**: The company maintained its non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $3.15 to $3.30 but reduced its GAAP EPS range due to merger-related costs. The tax rate guidance was also adjusted to 21% to 24% for the full year[5].

5. **Pipeline and R&D**: There were delays and challenges in certain pipeline projects, such as telcagepant, but overall R&D spending remains robust, and the company is committed to its pipeline growth strategy[5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the reduced revenue guidance, merger-related costs, and challenges in certain product segments. However, the strong performance of key products and the promising merger integration could mitigate some of these negative impacts.

**Rating:**
-1

This rating reflects a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock in the short term, driven by the mixed earnings performance and ongoing challenges, but with some potential for stabilization or recovery as the merger integration and product pipeline progress become more clear.
