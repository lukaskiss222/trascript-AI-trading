Merck & Co., Inc.'s third-quarter 2009 earnings call highlights several positive and some cautionary notes that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Product Performance**: Key products like SINGULAIR, JANUVIA, JANUMET, and ISENTRESS showed strong growth, contributing to a 2% year-over-year revenue increase.
- **Merger Progress**: Significant progress in the merger with Schering-Plough, including shareholder approval and the announcement of a global leadership team, suggests a smooth transition and potential for future growth.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Continued cost reduction and streamlining activities, along with a higher non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, indicate strong operational performance.
- **Pipeline and Partnerships**: New scientific discoveries, partnerships (e.g., with Portola Pharmaceuticals and Hilleman Laboratories), and expanded vaccine portfolio are positive indicators for future innovation and growth.

### Cautionary Notes
- **Foreign Exchange Impact**: A 3% negative impact from foreign exchange on the top line and a 2% impact on the bottom line could continue to affect performance.
- **Challenges in Certain Markets**: Declines in sales of GARDASIL and the cholesterol joint venture products (ZETIA and VYTORIN) in some markets could continue to be a concern.
- **Regulatory and Market Uncertainties**: The impact of upcoming studies (e.g., ARBITER 6) and changing market dynamics (e.g., HIV treatment guidelines) could introduce some uncertainty.

Given these factors, the overall tone of the call is positive, especially considering the strong product performance, progress on the merger, and the company's focus on innovation and efficiency. However, the short-term impact might be slightly muted by the challenges in certain markets and regulatory uncertainties.
