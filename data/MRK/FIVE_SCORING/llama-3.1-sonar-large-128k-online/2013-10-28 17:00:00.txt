Merck's third-quarter 2013 earnings call presented a mixed picture with both positive and challenging aspects. Here are the key points:

### Positive Aspects
- **Solid Underlying Performance**: Despite patent expiries and foreign exchange headwinds, Merck delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.92, driven by strong growth in vaccines, immunology, and HIV businesses[1|.
- **Innovation Pipeline**: The company received breakthrough therapy designations for its anti-PD1 and HCV programs, and made significant progress in other key programs like V503 and suvorexant[1|.
- **Cost Management**: Merck has been effective in reducing costs, with a plan to reduce the cost base by $2.5 billion by the end of 2015. This includes proactive cost management and restructuring efforts[1|.
- **Financial Performance**: The company narrowed its 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $3.48 to $3.52 and maintained a strong dividend and share repurchase program[1/.

### Challenges
- **Patent Expiries**: The loss of exclusivity for several brands, including Singulair, and the impact of generic erosion on high-margin products like Singulair, affected sales and gross margins[1|.
- **Foreign Exchange**: Significant foreign exchange headwinds, particularly from the Japanese yen and Venezuelan devaluation, impacted sales and earnings[1|.
- **Januvia Performance**: Januvia sales in the U.S. declined due to lower customer inventory levels and competitive pressures, despite maintaining a strong market share[1|.
- **Regulatory Challenges**: Merck faced regulatory setbacks, including complete response letters for some of its programs, which Roger Perlmutter acknowledged and is addressing through improved safety data management and study execution[1%.

### Short-Term Impact
Given the mixed performance and the ongoing challenges, the short-term impact on Merck's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Innovation Pipeline**: The breakthrough designations and progress in key programs are positive indicators for long-term growth.
- **Cost Management**: Effective cost reduction and efficiency measures are beneficial for maintaining profitability.
- **Challenges**: However, the immediate impact of patent expiries, foreign exchange headwinds, and competitive pressures in key markets like the U.S. for Januvia may temper short-term enthusiasm.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term, as the company's solid underlying performance and innovative pipeline are balanced by the immediate challenges.
