The transcript for Merck & Co., Inc.'s first-quarter 2018 earnings call presents several positive indicators that suggest a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Merck reported a 6% increase in worldwide sales to $10 billion, driven by significant growth in oncology, particularly from KEYTRUDA, which more than doubled its sales to nearly $1.5 billion. The company also raised its revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2018[5>.
- **Key Product Performance**: KEYTRUDA's compelling data from the KEYNOTE-189 study, which showed longer survival in nonsquamous first-line lung cancer patients, is expected to establish KEYTRUDA as a new standard of care. This, along with strong performances from other key products like GARDASIL and BRIDION, contributes to a positive outlook[5].
- **Operational Leverage**: The company anticipates long-term operating margin expansion driven by revenue growth, a shift in product mix, and disciplined expense management. This indicates potential for sustained profitability[5].
- ** Pipeline and Business Development**: Merck highlighted significant progress in its oncology pipeline, including new indications for KEYTRUDA, Lynparza, and Lenvima, as well as other promising research areas. The company's focus on business development to enhance its pipeline further supports long-term growth prospects[5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
