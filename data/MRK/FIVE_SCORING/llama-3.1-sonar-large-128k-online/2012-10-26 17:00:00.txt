The earnings call for Merck & Co., Inc. for the third quarter of 2012 presents a mixed but generally positive outlook. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Performance of Key Products**: Despite the loss of patent exclusivity for SINGULAIR, Merck maintained its revenue at or near 2011 levels on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong growth of key products like JANUVIA, JANUMET, GARDASIL, VICTRELIS, and ZOSTAVAX[5|.
- **Geographical Expansion**: Emerging market sales grew 15% excluding exchange, with significant growth in China and other high-growth markets[5|.
- **Cost Management and R&D**: Merck reduced marketing and administrative expenses and maintained flat R&D expenses year-over-year. The company is advancing multiple R&D programs, including suvorexant, odanacatib, and vintafolide, and has several significant filings planned[5|.
- **Guidance and Outlook**: The company narrowed its EPS guidance to $3.78-$3.82 for 2012 and expects to maintain revenue at or near 2011 levels despite headwinds. For 2013, while specific guidance was not provided, the company anticipates a product mix shift that may impact gross margins, but they are confident in their ability to manage these challenges and continue driving growth[5%.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong underlying business performance, successful management of patent expirations, and promising R&D pipeline.
