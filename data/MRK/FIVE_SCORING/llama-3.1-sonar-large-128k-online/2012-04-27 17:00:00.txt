Merck's first-quarter 2012 earnings call presented several positive and challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Aspects
- **Strong Revenue Growth**: Merck reported a 1% increase in worldwide sales, driven by growth in its pharmaceutical, animal health, and consumer care divisions. Key products like JANUVIA, JANUMET, GARDASIL, and VICTRELIS showed double-digit growth.
- **Cost Management**: The company managed costs effectively, resulting in an 8% increase in non-GAAP EPS. This was achieved through reduced field forces, improved operating efficiency, and decreased promotional spending on mature brands.
- **Pipeline Momentum**: Merck highlighted several promising pipeline products, including Suvorexant, BRIDION, V503, odanacatib, and TREDAPTIVE, which are expected to drive future growth.
- **Emerging Markets**: The company saw significant growth in emerging markets, particularly in China, Brazil, and other regions, which contributed to overall sales.

### Challenging Aspects
- **Patent Expirations**: The upcoming patent expiration of SINGULAIR in the U.S. in August 2012 is expected to impact revenues negatively. However, Merck anticipates maintaining revenues at or near 2011 levels on a constant currency basis despite this headwind.
- **Foreign Exchange**: The company faced a 1% to 3% unfavorable impact on sales due to foreign exchange rates, which could continue to affect second-quarter sales.
- **Alliance Revenue and Third-Party Manufacturing**: A significant decline in alliance revenue and third-party manufacturing sales due to lower commercial demand and divestitures also impacted total revenues.

### Conclusion
Given the strong performance in key product segments, effective cost management, and promising pipeline developments, Merck's stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term. However, the immediate challenges from patent expirations and foreign exchange may temper some of this enthusiasm.
