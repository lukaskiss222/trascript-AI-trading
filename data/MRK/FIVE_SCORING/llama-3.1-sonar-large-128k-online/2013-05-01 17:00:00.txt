Merck's first-quarter 2013 earnings call highlighted several key points that will likely influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Challenging Top-Line Performance**: Merck faced significant headwinds due to patent expiries, particularly for SINGULAIR, MAXALT, CLARINEX, and PROPECIA, leading to a 9% decline in worldwide sales. This decline and additional foreign exchange pressures have led to a revised downward guidance for 2013[4].

2. **Cost Management and Share Repurchases**: Despite the top-line challenges, Merck managed to achieve its first-quarter EPS target through cost-cutting measures and benefited from unanticipated tax items. The company also announced a $15 billion share repurchase program, aiming to repurchase $7.5 billion in the next 12 months, which could be accretive to EPS[4].

3. **Pipeline and R&D**: Merck is advancing its pipeline with several promising products, including the PD1 monoclonal antibody (MK-3475) and the SGLT2 inhibitor (ERTUGLIFLOZIN) in collaboration with Pfizer. However, R&D expenses are expected to increase due to new programs and milestones[4].

4. **Regional and Product Performance**: While some segments like vaccines, immunology, and animal health showed strong performance, others like JANUVIA faced challenges due to competitive pressures and inventory adjustments. Emerging markets continued to grow, driven by investments in commercial, manufacturing, and R&D[4].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the downward revision in guidance, ongoing patent expiry impacts, and increased R&D spending. However, the commitment to returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the potential of its pipeline could mitigate some of this pressure.
