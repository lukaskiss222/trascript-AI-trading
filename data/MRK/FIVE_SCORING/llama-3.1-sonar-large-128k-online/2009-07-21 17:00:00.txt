Merck & Co., Inc.'s second-quarter 2009 earnings call presented several key points that will likely influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Solid Operational Performance**: Merck reported a solid second quarter with strong growth from key pharmaceutical brands such as Singulair, Januvia, and Janumet, despite challenges from foreign exchange and higher R&D investments. This performance supports their full-year guidance.

2. **Merger with Schering-Plough**: The company is making good progress on the proposed merger, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2009. The merger is anticipated to bring significant benefits, including a broader portfolio, a stronger pipeline, and incremental cost savings of approximately $3.5 billion annually beyond 2011.

3. **Guidance Reaffirmation**: Merck reaffirmed their 2009 guidance, including revenue, non-GAAP EPS, and GAAP EPS, which indicates stability and confidence in their financial outlook.

4. **Challenges and Opportunities**: While there are challenges such as the impact of foreign exchange, litigation expenses, and the slowing growth of Zetia and Vytorin, the company is implementing strategies to drive growth, particularly in vaccines and key brands. The recent FDA approval for Isentress and new marketing initiatives for Zostavax are positive indicators.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, with Merck demonstrating resilience in a challenging environment and making significant strategic moves to enhance its future performance.
