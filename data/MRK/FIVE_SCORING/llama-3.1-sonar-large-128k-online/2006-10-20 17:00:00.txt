The transcript of Merck & Co., Inc.'s third quarter 2006 earnings call presents several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Strong Performance and Guidance**: Merck reported strong earnings, driven by the performance of Singulair, Vytorin, Zetia, and its vaccines. The company raised its full-year 2006 EPS guidance, which is a positive indicator[5].

2. **Vioxx Litigation**: Despite the strong performance, the significant legal defense reserves for Vioxx litigation ($958 million as of September 30, 2006) could introduce some uncertainty and potentially impact investor sentiment negatively[5].

3. **New Product Launches**: The approval and successful launch of new products like Januvia, Gardasil, Rotateq, and Zostavax are major positives, indicating a robust pipeline and growth potential[5].

4. **Cost Management and Restructuring**: Merck's ongoing cost management initiatives and restructuring efforts are showing positive effects, contributing to the company's financial health[5].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, reflecting Merck's solid financial performance, strong product launches, and effective cost management. However, the ongoing Vioxx litigation costs introduce a minor cautionary note.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings, raised guidance, and successful new product launches, despite the lingering uncertainty from Vioxx litigation.
