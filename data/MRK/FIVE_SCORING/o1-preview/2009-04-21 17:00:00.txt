Merck's Q1 2009 earnings call highlighted weaker revenues and earnings, impacted by the loss of exclusivity on key drugs like FOSAMAX, lower sales of SINGULAIR and GARDASIL, and supply constraints in vaccines. While management expressed optimism for a stronger second half and the potential benefits of the upcoming Schering-Plough merger, short-term challenges such as delayed drug filings and economic headwinds are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Therefore, the stock may experience short-term pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
