Merck's Q3 2010 earnings call showed strong performance, with key products like JANUVIA, JANUMET, and SINGULAIR driving significant sales growth. The company raised its EPS guidance and is on track with cost synergies from the Schering-Plough merger. Positive management tone and a robust pipeline suggest a favorable short-term outlook for the stock.
