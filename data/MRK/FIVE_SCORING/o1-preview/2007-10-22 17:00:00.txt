Merck's strong Q3 2007 results, featuring a 47% increase in EPS and 12% revenue growth driven by key products like GARDASIL and JANUVIA, demonstrate robust performance surpassing expectations. The company's upward revision of full-year EPS guidance reflects management's confidence in sustained growth. These positive financial results and optimistic outlook are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
