Merck reported strong Q4 and full-year 2016 results, exceeding EPS expectations and delivering revenue growth driven by key products like KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and JANUVIA. The company's positive guidance for 2017, continued investment in a promising pipeline, and successful expansion of KEYTRUDA's indications suggest optimism for short-term growth. These factors are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
