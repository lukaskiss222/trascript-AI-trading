Merck reported solid financial results with strong performances from key products like GARDASIL and SINGULAIR. However, ongoing concerns and negative publicity surrounding the ENHANCE trial for VYTORIN and ZETIA, as well as the imminent patent expiration of FOSAMAX, may create short-term headwinds. Despite management's positive outlook and reaffirmed guidance, these uncertainties could exert negative pressure on the stock price in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
