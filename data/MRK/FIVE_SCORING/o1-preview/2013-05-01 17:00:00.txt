Merck's earnings call highlighted short-term challenges, including lowered 2013 guidance due to patent expirations and weaker-than-expected sales of key products like JANUVIA. Despite announcing a significant share repurchase program, the immediate impact of reduced earnings expectations and operational pressures is likely to weigh on the stock. Overall, these factors suggest a negative short-term outlook for Merck's stock price.
