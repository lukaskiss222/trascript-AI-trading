Merck reported solid first-quarter earnings and reaffirmed its financial guidance for the year, expressing confidence in achieving double-digit EPS growth by 2010. Despite challenges with declining sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA due to negative publicity, strong performance from key products like SINGULAIR, JANUVIA, JANUMET, and GARDASIL indicates continued growth. Management's proactive measures and optimistic tone suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
