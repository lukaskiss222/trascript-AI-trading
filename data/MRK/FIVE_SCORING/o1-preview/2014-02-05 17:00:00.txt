Merck's earnings call indicated that while the company met its 2013 earnings guidance, it expects 2014 to be a "trough year" with lower revenues due to patent expirations and continued headwinds. The lowered EPS guidance and anticipation of declining sales may lead to negative investor sentiment in the short term. Despite cost-cutting efforts and a promising pipeline, the immediate impact on the stock price is likely to be negative.
