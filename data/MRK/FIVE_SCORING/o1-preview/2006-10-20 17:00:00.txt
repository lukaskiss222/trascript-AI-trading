Merck reported strong Q3 earnings, exceeding expectations and raising full-year guidance. The successful performance of key products like Vytorin, Zetia, and the new vaccines, along with recent FDA approvals of Januvia and Zolinza, indicate positive growth prospects. Despite increased reserves for Vioxx legal costs, management's confident tone and strategic initiatives suggest a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
