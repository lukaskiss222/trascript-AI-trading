Merck's earnings call indicated upcoming challenges, notably the loss of patent protection for Cozaar/Hyzaar and TEMODAR, which will impact short-term revenues. Management expects earnings growth to be weighted towards the second half of the year due to these expirations and ongoing R&D investments. This suggests potential short-term pressure on the stock price.
