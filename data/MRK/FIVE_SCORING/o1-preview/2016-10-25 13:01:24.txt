Merck reported strong Q3 results with increased revenues and earnings, leading the company to raise its full-year guidance. Key growth drivers include robust sales of KEYTRUDA, with new FDA approvals expanding its market potential, and strong performance in the vaccines portfolio. While management acknowledged upcoming patent expiries for ZETIA and VYTORIN, they expressed confidence in offsetting these challenges through growth in other areas. The positive results and optimistic outlook suggest a likely positive short-term impact on the stock.
