Merck reported strong first-quarter results with double-digit EPS growth and increased revenues, driven by key products like JANUVIA and SINGULAIR. The company raised its EPS guidance midpoint, announced a $5 billion share buyback program, and showed confidence in its pipeline and cost-control measures. These positive financial results and optimistic outlook are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
