Merck reported solid Q2 earnings with 3% operational revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impacts and strong performance from key products like Singulair, Januvia, Janumet, and Isentress. The reaffirmation of full-year guidance and progress on the Schering-Plough merger, along with expected improvements in vaccine sales in the second half, indicate positive momentum. These factors are likely to bolster investor confidence and have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
