Merck reported strong Q4 and full-year 2006 results, with robust sales growth driven by key products like Gardasil and Januvia, and reaffirmed guidance for 2007 and long-term targets. Management's confident tone and successful new product launches suggest positive momentum for the company. While increased legal reserves due to ongoing VIOXX and Fosamax litigation may temper investor enthusiasm, the overall outlook is likely to have a positive impact on the stock in the short term.
