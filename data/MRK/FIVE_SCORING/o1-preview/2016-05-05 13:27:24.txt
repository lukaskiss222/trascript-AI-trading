Merck's Q1 earnings call indicated an upward revision of revenue and EPS guidance, reflecting strong performance and favorable currency impact, which is positive for the stock. Growth in key products like KEYTRUDA and the successful US launch of ZEPATIER highlight the company's robust pipeline and potential. While there are some challenges, such as delays in ZEPATIER's European launch and earlier-than-expected generic competition for NASONEX, the overall outlook is positive due to raised guidance and strong product momentum.
