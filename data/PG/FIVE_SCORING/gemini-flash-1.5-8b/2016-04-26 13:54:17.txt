P&G's earnings call highlights significant ongoing headwinds from foreign exchange and macroeconomic instability.  While they've made impressive strides in cost-cutting and portfolio optimization, the company maintains a cautious outlook for the near term, projecting continued pressure on sales and earnings for Q4 and possibly the beginning of 2017.  The message, despite some positive product innovations and sustained productivity, is one of short-term challenges and a longer-term commitment to a fundamental transformation.
