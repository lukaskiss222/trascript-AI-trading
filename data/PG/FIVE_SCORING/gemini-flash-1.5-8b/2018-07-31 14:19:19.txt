P&G's earnings call highlighted strong volume growth and improving market share, especially in China and the US.  Significant commodity and transportation cost increases, however, impacted profitability. Management emphasized a focus on driving productivity and strategic pricing to counter these headwinds. The guidance for fiscal 2019 suggests a cautious outlook, with organic sales growth projected at 2%â€“3% and potential for a modest decline in all-in sales growth.  This suggests potential short-term pressure on the stock as investors await clearer signals on pricing power and the ability to offset input cost increases.
