P&G's earnings call highlighted a focus on short-term value creation and long-term growth, with a shift from previous strategies.  Management emphasized the need  for improved execution, better consumer understanding, and more effective resource allocation.  This suggests a potential short-term period of adjustment as the company refocuses, but the long-term potential remains positive.
