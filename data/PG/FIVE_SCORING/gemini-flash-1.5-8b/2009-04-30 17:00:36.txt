P&G's Q3 earnings call highlighted a resilient performance despite a challenging macroeconomic environment.  While organic sales grew by 1%, the company's guidance for 2009 indicates continued pressure from declining market growth, inventory adjustments, and fluctuating commodity and foreign exchange markets.  Management emphasized long-term strategic investments and a commitment to delivering value to consumers, but the short-term impact of these factors will likely lead to a period of stock price consolidation in the coming weeks.
