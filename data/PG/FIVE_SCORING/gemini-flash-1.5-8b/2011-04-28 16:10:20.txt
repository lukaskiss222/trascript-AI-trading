P&G's earnings call highlighted strong volume growth and market share gains, driven by innovation and portfolio expansion across multiple regions and categories.  However, significant increases in commodity costs present a substantial headwind, prompting price increases projected to benefit primarily in the next fiscal year (2012).  Management is focused on offsetting cost impacts with cost-savings initiatives and maintaining strong investment levels in innovation, but the temporary impact of the commodity costs, supply chain issues, and market volatility in developed markets may impact near-term stock performance.
