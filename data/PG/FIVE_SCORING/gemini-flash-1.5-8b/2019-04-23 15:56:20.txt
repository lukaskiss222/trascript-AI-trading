P&G delivered strong Q1 results with organic sales growth exceeding expectations at 5%, driven by volume, pricing, and mix.  Management highlighted successful execution in key markets and categories, with a particular focus on product superiority.  However, some categories remain challenged, and ongoing investments in areas like marketing and supply chain transformation suggest a continued commitment to growth and sustained profitability.  The predicted short-term impact is likely positive, with a potential stock rally building on the strength of these results.
