P&G's earnings call highlighted strong organic sales growth, driven by volume and improving market share across many categories.  However, significant headwinds exist from foreign exchange and commodity cost increases, impacting earnings guidance negatively. Management acknowledged that pricing actions to offset these issues will only be implemented later in the year, potentially creating volatility in the short term.  Given the combination of strong volume growth that is not yet fully matched by pricing adjustments, and the ongoing uncertainty of the macro environment, the likely impact on stock price in the next 1-2 weeks is negative.
