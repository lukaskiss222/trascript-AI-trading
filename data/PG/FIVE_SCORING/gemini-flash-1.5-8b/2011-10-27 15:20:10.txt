P&G's Q1 earnings call highlights strong organic sales growth (4%) exceeding guidance, driven by broad-based gains across segments and a significant contribution from pricing.  However, higher commodity costs and the need to maintain marketing support for new product launches like Tide PODS led to lower-than-expected operating profit growth and a slight margin contraction. Management's tone is optimistic about the company's ability to offset these headwinds with pricing actions and continued productivity initiatives, but they project a challenging Q4 due to difficult commodity comparisons and currency headwinds.
