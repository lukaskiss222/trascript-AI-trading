P&G's earnings call highlights substantial positive momentum, with strong organic sales growth (8% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date) and core earnings per share increase (15% year-to-date).  Management has raised guidance for organic sales, earnings, cash flow, and dividend and share buybacks.  The optimism is tempered somewhat by commentary on a likely deceleration in the second half and uncertain consumer behavior, potentially impacting some categories.
