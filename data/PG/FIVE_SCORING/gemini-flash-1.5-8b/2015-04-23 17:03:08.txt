P&G's earnings call highlighted significant FX headwinds, but also substantial operational improvements.  Management emphasized productivity gains, portfolio simplification, and supply chain transformations as catalysts for future growth.  While organic sales growth was modest, management's guidance for double-digit constant-currency EPS growth and strong free cash flow suggests a positive outlook, but the reliance on these operational changes to overcome FX headwinds may impact the stock's near-term performance.
