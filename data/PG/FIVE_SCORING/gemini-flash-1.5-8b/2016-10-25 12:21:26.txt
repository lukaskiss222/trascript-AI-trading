P&G's Q1 earnings show positive sequential growth, driven by volume increases across categories and regions.  Management, while noting ongoing challenges, expresses confidence in the company's ability to return to market growth levels in the coming quarters. The focus on redistributing promotional budgets to innovation and bolstering brand equity suggests a long-term strategy to mitigate pricing wars. This suggests a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact, with potential for further positive momentum if the anticipated reinvestments translate to stronger sales growth in the upcoming quarters.
