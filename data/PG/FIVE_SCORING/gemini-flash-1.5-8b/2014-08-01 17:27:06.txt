P&G's earnings call highlights a strategic shift toward a streamlined brand portfolio, focusing on 70-80 core brands.  Management emphasizes that this move is not about cutting marketing but rather about focusing investments on higher-potential brands.  While the company expects some challenges in the near term, particularly in the first half of 2015, ongoing productivity initiatives and investment in consumer-preferred brands suggest potential for mid-single digit earnings growth.
