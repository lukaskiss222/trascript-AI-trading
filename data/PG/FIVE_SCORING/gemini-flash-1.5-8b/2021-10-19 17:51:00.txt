P&G's Q1 earnings beat expectations, driven by strong organic sales growth (4%) across most categories.  Management highlighted healthy consumer demand, particularly in essential product categories, and continued execution on their  "superiority" strategy.  While facing headwinds from rising input costs, they've taken pricing action and are expecting better earnings progression as price increases ramp up—thus the maintained outlook—leading to a likely positive market reaction in the coming weeks.
