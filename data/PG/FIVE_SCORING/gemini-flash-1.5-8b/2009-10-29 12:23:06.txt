P&G's earnings call signaled continued strength, exceeding guidance on both top-line and bottom-line figures.  Management highlighted strong innovation program results, particularly in back-half launches, and positive volume trends, though still lapping a strong prior quarter.  While foreign exchange remains a factor, the company anticipates easier comparisons and improved volumes in future quarters.
