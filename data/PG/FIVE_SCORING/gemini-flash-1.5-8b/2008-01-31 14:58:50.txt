P&G's earnings call highlights strong Q2 results exceeding expectations, driven by solid volume growth and positive foreign exchange.  Management emphasizes continued market share gains globally, particularly in developing markets, and a resilience to potential trade-down to private label.  However, significant commodity and energy cost increases are impacting gross margins, necessitating price increases in the upcoming quarters.  These factors point to short-term pressure on the stock price driven by the margin pressures but a longer-term positive outlook due to global share growth.
