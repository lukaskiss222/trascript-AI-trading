P&G's earnings call highlights strong organic sales growth (7%) despite challenging global conditions, particularly in China and Russia. Management maintained guidance, citing continued execution of integrated strategies and strong pricing offsetting volume declines and rising costs.  While commodity and foreign exchange headwinds are significant, the company projects to offset a portion of these costs with price increases.  The short-term impact likely leans positive, with a potential market rally driven by the company's revenue and pricing power resilience.
