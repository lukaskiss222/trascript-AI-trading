P&G's earnings call highlights strong volume growth (7% organic volume growth, fastest in 18 quarters), exceeding earnings expectations despite targeted pricing interventions.  Robust innovation, particularly in skin care and male grooming, and cost-cutting measures drove margin expansion.  The company's guidance increase for share repurchases and the strong dividend raise suggest confidence in future performance.
