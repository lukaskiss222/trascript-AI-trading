P&G's earnings call highlights continued strong performance, driven by innovation and productivity gains in key segments.  Management reaffirmed their guidance, but emphasized ongoing foreign exchange headwinds and a slightly softer market environment, particularly in the first half.  The company's focus on cost savings and innovation, along with the positive impact of recent product launches, suggests a potentially strong second half.
