P&G's earnings call reveals strong first-quarter performance, exceeding expectations on EPS and volume growth.  Management highlights broad-based growth across segments and geographies, driven by successful new product launches and market expansions.  While commodity cost increases and a sequential dip in pricing are acknowledged, the call also emphasizes continued cost-saving efforts, which will offset some of these pressures.  This favorable outlook and strong guidance suggests a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
