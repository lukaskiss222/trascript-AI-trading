Based on the earnings call transcript, P&G appears positioned for positive short-term stock performance. Key positives include:

1. Strong U.S. business momentum with 7% organic growth in Q4, indicating successful turnaround in their largest market
2. Clear strategy articulation by returning CEO A.G. Lafley focused on value creation, productivity improvements, and disciplined execution
3. Solid FY2014 guidance of 5-7% core EPS growth despite FX headwinds
4. Continued commitment to productivity initiatives and cost savings ($1.4B targeted for FY14)
5. Healthy dividend and share repurchase plans indicating financial strength

While there are some challenges (FX headwinds, slower developing market growth), management appears to have clear plans to address issues and maintain momentum. The CEO's return and strategic focus should provide confidence to investors in the near term.
