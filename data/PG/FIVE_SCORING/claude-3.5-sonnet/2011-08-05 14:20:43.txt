Based on this earnings call transcript, P&G shows mixed signals but appears positioned for modest positive momentum in the short-term. Key positives include:

1. Strong innovation pipeline and global expansion plans with 32 new category-country combinations added
2. Successful pricing actions to offset cost inflation, though with some near-term share risk
3. Continued strong growth in emerging markets (20%+ in Brazil/India)

However, there are some headwinds:

1. Significant commodity cost pressures (~$1.8B headwind)
2. Weak developed market growth (only 1-2% expected)
3. Higher tax rate creating 2% EPS growth headwind

Management appears confident in their strategy but acknowledges near-term challenges. With pricing actions taking hold and commodity pressures expected to ease throughout the year, the company should see accelerating profit growth after a challenging Q1.

Given the mixed factors but generally constructive outlook for improvement through FY2012, I expect a modestly positive short-term stock reaction.
