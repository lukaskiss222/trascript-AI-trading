Based on the earnings transcript, P&G delivered a strong quarter with healthy organic growth, expanding margins, and market share gains across most categories. Key positives include:

1. 6% organic sales growth, above long-term target range
2. 160 basis point operating margin expansion
3. Strong market share gains across major brands/categories
4. Successful Fusion razor launch in North America
5. Positive guidance for fiscal 2007

Management struck a confident tone regarding market share momentum, innovation pipeline, and ability to manage through cost pressures. While there were some inventory adjustments and slowing growth in China, these appear temporary rather than structural concerns.

Given the company's strong fundamental performance, market leadership positions, and positive outlook for 2007, I expect the stock to react positively over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the quality of results.
