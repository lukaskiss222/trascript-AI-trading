Based on this earnings call, P&G faces significant near-term challenges. Key concerns include:

1. Market share losses in developed markets and pricing pressures requiring rollbacks in several key categories
2. Weak innovation performance, particularly in Beauty Care
3. Lower guidance for Q4 and FY2022
4. High commodity costs and margin pressures
5. Underperformance vs competitors who are growing organic sales at 5-6%+

However, there are some mitigating factors:
- Full benefit of pricing actions will be realized next year
- Productivity program targeting $10B in cost savings
- Strong innovation pipeline planned
- Healthy performance in developing markets

Overall, given the multiple headwinds, downward guidance revision, and likely continued pressure on margins and market share over the next few weeks, I expect negative short-term impact on the stock price.
