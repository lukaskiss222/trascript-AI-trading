Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on P&G's stock:

The call revealed several positives:
- Strong organic volume growth of 7% (highest in 5 years)
- Market share gains across regions and major brands
- Solid cost savings of 150+ basis points
- Innovation pipeline described as strongest "in decades"

However, there are some concerns:
- Gross margins declined 70 basis points due to commodity cost pressures
- Price/mix reduced sales by 3%
- Guidance maintained but not raised despite Q1 beat
- Significant supply constraints mentioned in key growth areas

Overall, while long-term fundamentals appear strong, the combination of margin pressure and maintained guidance suggests limited near-term upside for the stock. The market is likely to take a neutral to slightly positive view.
