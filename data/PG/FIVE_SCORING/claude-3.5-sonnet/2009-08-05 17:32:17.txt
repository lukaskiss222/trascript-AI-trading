Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a modest negative impact on P&G's stock price in the 1-2 week timeframe. While management outlined promising long-term strategies and investments, there are several near-term headwinds that will likely pressure the stock:

1. Q1 FY2010 guidance was weak, with organic sales expected to decline 0-3% and continued FX headwinds.

2. Management indicated market share losses in several key categories that need to be addressed through increased investment spending and pricing actions.

3. The company's restructuring and simplification initiatives, while positive long-term, will require significant investment ($600M) in FY2010 before benefits are realized.

The negatives are partially offset by improving commodity costs and a strong innovation pipeline, but investors will likely focus on the near-term challenges and conservative guidance before seeing evidence of improvement.
