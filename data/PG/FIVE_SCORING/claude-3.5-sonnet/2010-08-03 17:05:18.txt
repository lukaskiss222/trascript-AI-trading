Based on this detailed earnings call transcript, P&G demonstrated strong operational momentum with 8% volume growth (highest in 6 years) and market share gains across 60% of their business. However, key points of concern include:

1. Heavy marketing investment impacting margins significantly in Q4
2. Price/mix headwinds from developing market growth and value-tier products
3. Some skepticism from analysts about ability to maintain growth acceleration given tougher comparisons ahead

Management appears very confident in their ability to deliver on FY2011 guidance through:
- Full-year benefit of recent major innovations launched in Q4 2010
- Continued market share momentum 
- Cost savings and productivity initiatives
- Strong innovation pipeline

However, given margin pressures and questions around sustainability of growth acceleration, the stock is likely to face some short-term uncertainty as investors digest the results and await evidence of delivery against guidance.
