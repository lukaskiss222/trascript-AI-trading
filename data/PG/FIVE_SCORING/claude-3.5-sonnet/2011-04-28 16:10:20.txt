Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my short-term market analysis:

Key positives:
- Strong organic volume growth of 5% across most segments and regions
- Market share gains in 2/3 of global business
- Pricing actions announced to offset commodity costs
- Lower effective tax rate guidance (24% vs previous 26-28%)

Key concerns:
- Operating margins declined 210 basis points due to commodity cost pressures
- Most pricing actions won't take effect until June/July 2012
- Slower growth in developed markets
- Ongoing supply constraints in some categories

The overall tone was cautiously optimistic but defensive regarding margin pressures. While management expressed confidence in their strategy, near-term headwinds from rising input costs and delayed pricing benefits will likely pressure the stock over the next 1-2 weeks, even with decent volume growth.
