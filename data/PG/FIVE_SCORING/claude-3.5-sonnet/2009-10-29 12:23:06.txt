Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) stock price impact:

Key Positives:
- Organic sales grew 2%, beating guidance of flat to -3%
- Record shipment volumes in September
- Raised full-year organic sales growth guidance
- Strong cash flow with $4B in free cash flow
- Early success with innovations like Tide Stain Release and Olay Pro-X

Key Concerns:
- Conservative on EPS guidance despite sales growth
- Some key categories still showing weakness (batteries, appliances, etc.)
- Heavy marketing spend planned for back half of year
- Margins likely peaked this quarter due to commodity cost benefits
- Still seeing volume pressure in developing markets

Overall, while P&G showed solid results and raised sales guidance, their conservative EPS stance and planned higher spending could temper enthusiasm. The short-term stock reaction is likely to be modestly positive given the sales beat and guidance raise, but limited by the unchanged high-end EPS guidance.
