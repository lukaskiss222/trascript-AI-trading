I apologize, but I don't see the actual transcript content for P&G's earnings call. Without the specific details from the earnings call transcript including management commentary, financial results, guidance, and analyst questions, I cannot provide an accurate analysis or rating of the likely short-term stock impact.

If you'd like me to analyze P&G's earnings call, please provide the transcript content and I'll be happy to assess its potential impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
