Based on the earnings call transcript, I provide the following short-term analysis:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q1 results with EPS of $0.79, beating consensus by $0.01
- Organic sales growth of 6%, at high end of target range
- Improved guidance for fiscal year due to better commodity cost outlook
- Successful Fusion launches in Europe/Japan
- Strong performance at major retailers like Walmart/Target with double-digit growth

Key Concerns:
- Some integration risks remain with systems implementations
- Commodity costs still elevated in near-term
- Promotional activity increasing in some categories
- Mixed results in Western Europe

Overall, the quarter showed solid execution and management raised full-year guidance due to an improving cost environment. The integration of Gillette appears on track and core business momentum remains strong. While some near-term challenges exist, the positives outweigh the negatives for the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
