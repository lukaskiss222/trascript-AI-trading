**Analysis:**

Based on the earnings transcript, Procter & Gamble (P&G) reported solid first-quarter results, with organic sales growing 4% and core earnings per share up 8%. The company reaffirmed its 2014 guidance, expecting 3% to 4% organic sales growth, 5% to 7% core EPS growth, and 90% free cash flow productivity. However, there are some concerns:

1. **Foreign Exchange (FX) Impact**: FX headwinds are expected to be a significant sales growth headwind in the first half of the fiscal year, which could negatively impact the stock in the short term.
2. **Competitive Promotional Spending**: Increased promotional spending from competitors ahead of P&G's product initiatives could lead to a temporary increase in price discounting.
3. **Gross Margin Pressure**: Gross margin is expected to sequentially improve, but the full-year outlook remains uncertain due to mix impacts and FX headwinds.

**Conclusion:**

Given the mixed signals, the short-term impact on the stock price is expected to be neutral. The stock may face some pressure due to FX headwinds and competitive promotional spending, but the solid organic sales growth and reaffirmed guidance provide some support. The stock rating is:
