### Short-Term (1â€“2 Weeks) Impact Analysis

**Main Reasoning:**
The P&G earnings call highlighted strong organic sales growth and consistent shareholder returns, but the company's gross margin pressure and the potential for further price increases due to commodity and energy costs raised concerns. The announcement of the coffee business exit also introduces uncertainty. The company's guidance for 2008 and 2009 was adjusted upwards, which could be seen as a positive signal, but the market's reaction to the gross margin pressure and the coffee business exit will be critical.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to face some short-term pressure due to the gross margin pressure and the coffee business exit. However, the company's strong sales growth and shareholder returns, along with the adjusted guidance, suggest that the stock may stabilize or rally slightly in the near term.
