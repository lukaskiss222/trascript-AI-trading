**Rating: 1**

The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings results and the company's ability to manage cost pressures and maintain its growth trajectory. However, the stock is also likely to face some volatility due to the uncertainty surrounding commodity and freight costs, as well as the potential impact of inflation and stimulus phase-outs on consumer spending.
