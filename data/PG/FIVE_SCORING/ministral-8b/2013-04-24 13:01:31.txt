Based on the earnings transcript, the following analysis is provided:

### Analysis:
- **Top-Line Performance:** The company reported a slight deceleration in organic sales growth in the March quarter, driven by a combination of lower market growth and foreign exchange impacts. However, the company maintained a strong market share position, particularly in the U.S. and China.
- **Innovation and Market Share:** The company highlighted several new innovations, such as Tide PODS, Ariel PODS, and various hair care and oral care products, which are expected to drive market share growth and top-line performance in the future.
- **Cost Savings and Productivity:** The company reported strong productivity improvements and cost savings, particularly in SG&A costs, which helped to offset some of the negative impacts on gross margin. The company also mentioned plans to reduce non-manufacturing staffing by 10% by the end of the fiscal year.
- **Dividend and Share Repurchase:** The company increased its quarterly dividend by 7% and raised its share repurchase target to $6 billion, indicating a commitment to returning value to shareholders.
- **Outlook:** The company provided updated guidance for the fiscal year 2013, with organic sales growth expected to be in the range of 3% to 4% and all-in sales growth expected to be in the range of 1% to 2%. The company also raised its core earnings per share guidance range to $3.96 to $4.04.

### Conclusion:
The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price is expected to be positive due to the company's strong market share position, innovative products, and commitment to returning value to shareholders. The company's focus on cost savings and productivity improvements also suggests that it is well-positioned to navigate any short-term headwinds.
