Based on the earnings transcript, P&G's stock is likely to experience short-term negative impact due to the significant currency devaluation and the increased focus on cost-cutting measures. The company's guidance for organic sales growth and constant currency core earnings per share growth was revised downward, and the company expects foreign exchange to have a 12-point impact on core earnings per share growth for the year. Additionally, the company's focus on productivity savings and cost-cutting measures may lead to a temporary reduction in spending on brands and products, which could negatively impact the company's long-term growth prospects. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure as investors digest these changes and assess the potential impact on the company's future growth prospects.
