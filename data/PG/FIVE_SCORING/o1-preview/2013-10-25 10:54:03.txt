Procter & Gamble reported solid organic sales growth of 4% and reconfirmed its fiscal year guidance, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds impacting earnings.

The reaffirmation of guidance and positive outlook on operational efficiency suggest a modest positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
