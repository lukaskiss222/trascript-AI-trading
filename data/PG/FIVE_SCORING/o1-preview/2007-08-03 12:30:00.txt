Procter & Gamble reported strong quarterly results with an EPS increase of 22% and sales growth of 8%, exceeding expectations. The company's announcement of a $24â€“30 billion share repurchase plan over the next three years signals strong confidence in future growth. This positive outlook, combined with solid market share gains and robust performance in developing markets, is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
