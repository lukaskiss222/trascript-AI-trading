Based on the Q1 2025 earnings call transcript for The Procter & Gamble Company, here are the key points that could impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

### Positive Points
- Organic sales grew 2% year-over-year, despite a strong prior-year base, indicating continued growth in core business areas[2][4].
- Core EPS increased by 5% to $1.93, showing strength in underlying earnings[2][4].
- The company maintained its fiscal 2025 guidance for sales and EPS growth, suggesting confidence in future performance[2][4].
- Strong cash flow and return to shareholders, with $4.3 billion in operating cash flow and $4.4 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases[2][4].

### Negative Points
- Net sales decreased by 1% to $21.7 billion, missing expectations[2][4].
- Diluted EPS declined by 12% to $1.61 due to higher restructuring charges, which could be a short-term concern for investors[2][4].
- Certain segments, such as Beauty and Skin Care, saw declines in organic sales, which might raise concerns about specific product performance[4].

### Overall Impact
Given the mixed results, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly negative reaction in the short term. The positive organic sales growth and maintained guidance are counterbalanced by the decline in net sales and diluted EPS. However, the company's strong cash flow and commitment to its integrated growth strategy may mitigate some of the negative impacts.
