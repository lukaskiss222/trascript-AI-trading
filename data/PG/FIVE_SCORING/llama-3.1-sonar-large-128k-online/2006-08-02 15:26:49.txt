Key points include:
- Strong top- and bottom-line growth despite higher commodity and energy prices and a challenging competitive environment.
- Organic sales growth of 8% in the quarter, exceeding guidance, and broad-based growth across geographies and business units.
- Significant improvements in gross margins and operating margins, driven by cost savings, organic volume growth, and pricing actions.
- Successful integration of Gillette, with cost synergies and revenue growth on track with expectations.
- Strong cash flow performance, with operating cash flow up $1.1 billion and free cash flow productivity at 115%.
- Positive market share trends, with about two-thirds of the business growing share globally.
