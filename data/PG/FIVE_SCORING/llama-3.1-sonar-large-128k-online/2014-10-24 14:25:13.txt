Procter & Gamble's Q4 2024 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results that are likely to have a short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Earnings**: While P&G's earnings beat expectations, the revenue fell short of estimates, remaining flat year-over-year at $20.5 billion. Organic sales grew 2%, but this was below the expected growth rate[1][3][4].
- **Macro Challenges**: The company faced significant headwinds from foreign exchange, market level challenges in several regions, and increased consumption taxes. These factors are expected to continue, with foreign exchange predicted to be a negative 2-point impact on sales growth and a 5-6 point headwind on core earnings per share growth[4].
- **Guidance and Outlook**: P&G maintained its core earnings per share growth guidance range of mid single-digits, despite the FX headwinds. The company also expects to deliver strong organic sales growth, though at a slower rate than previously anticipated. The all-in GAAP earnings per share are expected to be down 2% to 5% versus the prior fiscal year[4].
- **Productivity and Innovation**: P&G highlighted significant productivity savings and innovation successes, such as the FlexBall razor and other product launches. However, the impact of these innovations on organic sales growth was not as strong as anticipated, with only a 2% organic sales growth[4].
- **Divestitures and Restructuring**: The decision to exit the Duracell business and other portfolio rationalization efforts may impact earnings in the short term but are part of a larger strategy to focus on core brands and improve profitability[4].

Given these points, the short-term outlook for P&G's stock is likely neutral to slightly negative due to the mixed results, ongoing macro challenges, and the immediate impact of divestitures and restructuring efforts.
