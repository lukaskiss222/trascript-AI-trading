The Procter & Gamble Company's third-quarter earnings call highlighted several key points that are likely to influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: P&G delivered solid top and bottom line growth, with earnings per share increasing 11% and total sales up 9%. This performance was driven by volume growth, favorable foreign exchange, and strong operating margin expansion[3].

2. **Managing Commodity and Energy Costs**: Despite significant increases in commodity and energy costs, P&G has managed to maintain financial commitments through pricing, cost savings, and productivity improvements. The company expects to continue managing these costs effectively in the future[3].

3. **Positive Guidance**: The company provided robust guidance for the June quarter and fiscal 2008, including expected organic sales growth of 4-6% and earnings per share growth. For fiscal 2009, P&G aims to deliver underlying EPS growth of 10% despite the impact of the Folgers transaction[3].

4. **Consumer Reaction to Price Increases**: P&G has not seen significant trade-downs or negative consumer reactions to price increases, as both branded competitors and private labels have also raised prices to cover higher commodity and energy costs[3].

5. **Innovation and Productivity**: The company emphasized its focus on innovation, product reformulation, and productivity improvements to drive growth and manage costs. This includes successful product launches and a strong innovation pipeline[3].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, indicating that P&G is well-positioned to navigate current challenges and maintain its growth trajectory.

### Conclusion
The strong financial performance, effective management of commodity costs, positive guidance, and focus on innovation and productivity suggest that the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
