The Procter & Gamble Company's earnings transcript indicates several key points that will influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

## Strong Organic Sales and Market Share Growth
Despite significant external challenges, P&G delivered strong organic sales growth of 4% for the fiscal year, ahead of underlying market growth. This, combined with market share gains in most regions, suggests a positive underlying business performance.

## Commodity Cost Pressures and Gross Margin Impact
The company faced substantial commodity cost increases, which negatively impacted gross margins. However, pricing actions, cost savings, and productivity improvements helped offset these costs to some extent. This dynamic is expected to continue into fiscal 2012, with the most challenging comparisons in the first quarter.

## Pricing and Promotion Strategies
P&G is implementing price increases to offset higher input costs, which may temporarily impact volume and market share due to competitive responses. However, the company is committed to maintaining competitiveness and is prepared to adjust strategies if necessary.

## Guidance and Outlook
For fiscal 2012, P&G expects organic sales growth of 3% to 6%, with earnings per share growth of 6% to 10%. The guidance reflects broader uncertainty in market growth rates, input costs, and foreign exchange.

## Innovation and Expansion
The company continues to invest heavily in innovation and market expansions, particularly in developing markets. This includes entering new category-country combinations, launching new products, and expanding into new channels.

Given these points:

- The strong organic sales growth and market share gains are positive indicators.
- The ongoing commodity cost pressures and their impact on gross margins could create short-term volatility.
- The aggressive pricing and promotion strategies are necessary but may have mixed short-term effects.
- The overall guidance for fiscal 2012 is positive, indicating continued growth.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to see stable to slightly positive performance in the short term, driven by the company's robust organic sales growth, market share gains, and strong innovation pipeline, despite the challenges posed by commodity costs.
