The Procter & Gamble Company's earnings transcript for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 presents a mixed picture with several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Organic Sales and Earnings Growth**: Despite challenging economic conditions, P&G delivered organic sales growth of 5% and diluted net earnings per share increase of 12%, which is above the high end of their guidance. This indicates the company's ability to maintain growth in a tough environment[5].

2. **Commodity and Foreign Exchange Pressures**: The company is facing significant commodity and foreign exchange headwinds. Commodity costs are expected to continue impacting the December quarter, while foreign exchange volatility, particularly in emerging markets, will have a negative impact on the top and bottom lines. However, P&G is managing these pressures through pricing, productivity measures, and cost savings programs[5].

3. **Guidance Update**: The guidance for fiscal 2009 has been adjusted slightly, with a wider range due to increased volatility in commodity and foreign exchange markets. Organic sales growth is still projected at 4-6%, but the all-in sales growth has been reduced due to foreign exchange impacts. EPS guidance remains relatively stable, reflecting the company's efforts to manage costs and maintain profitability[5].

4. **Market Share and Pricing**: P&G is experiencing some market share volatility due to pricing actions, but the company is confident that market shares will recover as price gaps normalize. The tiered portfolio strategy is helping to mitigate the impact of consumer trade-down[5].

5. **Cash Flow and Balance Sheet**: The company's cash flow and balance sheet remain strong, with a commitment to maintaining financial discipline and generating significant free cash flow[5].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Hereâ€™s why:

- The company's ability to deliver earnings growth and maintain strong cash flow in a challenging environment is a positive sign.
- The management's proactive approach to managing commodity and foreign exchange pressures suggests a robust strategy to mitigate these risks.
- However, the widened guidance ranges and the ongoing pressures from commodities and foreign exchange could introduce some short-term uncertainty.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience no significant negative impact but may not see substantial short-term gains due to the current market volatility and commodity pressures.
