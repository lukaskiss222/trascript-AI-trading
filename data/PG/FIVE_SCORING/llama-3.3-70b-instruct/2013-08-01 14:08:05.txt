The company's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with organic sales growth of 4% and core earnings per share slightly ahead of plan. However, the guidance for fiscal 2014 is cautious, with expected organic sales growth of 3-4% and core earnings per share growth of 5-7%. The company is focusing on productivity and cost savings, with a goal of delivering $1.4 billion in cost of goods sold savings in fiscal 2014. The CEO, A.G. Lafley, emphasized the importance of creating value for consumers and shareholders, and the company is taking a hard look at its portfolio to allocate resources to businesses where it can create disproportionate value.

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the cautious guidance and uncertainties around key markets, but the company's focus on productivity, cost savings, and creating value for consumers and shareholders could lead to long-term growth.
