Procter & Gamble's earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with the company achieving record sales in developing markets but facing challenges in developed markets. Management's focus on cost-cutting, innovation, and strategic investments in key categories and geographies is likely to drive long-term growth. However, the company's short-term guidance is cautious, with expected earnings per share growth of -1% to 4% in fiscal 2013.

The company's decision to restart share repurchases and its commitment to delivering long-term shareholder value are positive signals. Additionally, the company's Olympic sponsorship has generated significant awareness and sales, and its focus on emerging markets and innovation is likely to drive future growth.

However, the company's reliance on cost-cutting to drive earnings growth and the potential risks associated with its exposure to foreign exchange and commodity prices are concerns. Overall, while the company's long-term prospects appear positive, its short-term outlook is more uncertain.
