Procter & Gamble's earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with the company achieving record annual sales but facing headwinds from soaring commodity and energy costs. Despite these challenges, management's guidance for fiscal 2009 suggests a degree of confidence, with projected organic sales growth of 4-6% and earnings per share growth of 10%. The company's diversified portfolio, commitment to innovation, and focus on productivity are expected to drive long-term growth. However, the short-term outlook is uncertain, with potential gross margin compression in the September quarter due to commodity cost increases and pricing lags.
