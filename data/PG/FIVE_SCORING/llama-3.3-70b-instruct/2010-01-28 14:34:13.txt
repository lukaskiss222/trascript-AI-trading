Procter & Gamble's earnings transcript revealed strong Q2 results, driven by a 5% organic sales growth, which exceeded guidance. The company's innovation program, increased marketing support, and better consumer value contributed to the solid top-line performance. However, management noted that share growth was slightly below year-ago levels, but improving sequentially. The company is accelerating innovation and increasing marketing support in the second half, which should drive share growth.
