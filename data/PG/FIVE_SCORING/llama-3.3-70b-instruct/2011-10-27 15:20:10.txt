Procter & Gamble's Q1 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with the company achieving record sales but facing significant commodity cost headwinds. Management's commitment to innovation, cost savings, and strategic expansions suggests long-term potential, but near-term pressures may impact the stock. The company's guidance for fiscal year 2012 remains unchanged, despite currency fluctuations and commodity costs, which may lead to short-term volatility in the stock price.
