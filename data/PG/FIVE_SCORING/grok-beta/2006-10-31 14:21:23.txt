Procter & Gamble delivered a robust first quarter with strong earnings growth, surpassing expectations and showing balanced top and bottom-line growth. The company's focus on innovation, cost-saving measures, and progress in integrating Gillette bodes well, but the guidance for pricing and mix being neutral to positive suggests that significant price increases might not be forthcoming, potentially limiting further growth. The market will likely respond positively due to the raised EPS forecast for the year but will be tempered by concerns over commodity costs and future promotional activities.
