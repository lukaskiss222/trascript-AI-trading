The Procter & Gamble Companyâ€™s Q4 results and forward-looking statements suggest a stable business model with opportunities for growth, but the immediate short-term impact could be tempered by several factors. They've successfully met or exceeded long-term targets and are ahead on Gillette's integration, however, higher 2008 commodity costs, increased restructuring spending, the impact of laundry compaction in North America, and potential market softness could exert pressure on stock in the next few weeks. Nonetheless, P&G's focus on innovation, market share growth, and substantial share repurchases might mitigate some negative effects, providing a neutral short-term outlook.
