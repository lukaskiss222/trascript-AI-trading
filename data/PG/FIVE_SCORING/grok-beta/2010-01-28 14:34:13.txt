Procter & Gamble's strong Q2 results, with 5% organic sales growth and 22% core EPS growth, underpin a positive short-term stock price impact outlook. Despite geopolitical concerns like Venezuela, the company's strategic focus on innovation, acquisitions like Ambi Pur, and maintaining market share growth per major markets should appeal to investors. Additionally, their re-starting of share repurchase program further supports a positive market sentiment.
