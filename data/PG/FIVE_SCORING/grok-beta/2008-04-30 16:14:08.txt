Despite persistent challenges from commodity and energy costs, P&G delivered a solid earnings report with a 11% EPS increase and strong organic growth, which should support the stock in the short term. However, the conservative fiscal 2009 outlook and the mention of strategic initiatives like managing through cost increases temper potential enthusiasm. While the performance was largely in line or slightly above expectations, the stock might see a modest positive reaction due to continued growth and innovation but is likely balanced by concerns for next fiscal year.
