Procter & Gamble's fiscal year guidance for 2012 projects organic sales growth of 3% to 6% and core EPS growth of 6% to 10%, with expectations for operating profit growth to be in line with EPS growth. However, the early stages of price recovery and ongoing market challenges are likely to create short-term volatility in the stock price. While the company demonstrates robust innovation, strategic expansion, and productivity improvements, the potential headwinds from pricing strategies and commodity cost increases might weigh on investor sentiment in the short term.
