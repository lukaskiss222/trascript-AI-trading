Mixed signals were conveyed in P&G's Q4 and FY13 results, indicating short-term challenges. Reduced market growth rates, a strong dollar, and higher commodity costs are headwinds. However, the company's focus on productivity improvements, strategic investments, and maintaining market share are positive signs. 

The stock will likely experience a modest dip in the short term due to these challenges but could recover quickly if productivity gains and strategic initiatives are effectively implemented.
