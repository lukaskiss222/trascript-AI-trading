P&Gâ€™s mixed Q2 results and guidance reveal short-term challenges from supply constraints, higher commodity costs and muted developed market growth. However, broad-based volume and share gains, along with improved market conditions in H2 2011, present a positive outlook. The stock is likely to experience modest negative pressure in the short term, but a prospective earnings upgrade seems likely in the medium term.
